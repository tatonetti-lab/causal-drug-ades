6.1    Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Among 4,597 patients who treated the first migraine headache with eletriptan hydrobromide in short-term placebo-controlled trials, the most common adverse reactions reported with treatment with eletriptan hydrobromide were asthenia, nausea, dizziness and somnolence. These reactions appear to be dose-related.
In long-term open-label studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 128 (8.3%) out of 1,544 patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.
Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the subset of 5,125 migraineurs who received eletriptan doses of 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg or placebo in worldwide placebo-controlled clinical trials.
Only adverse reactions that were more frequent in a eletriptan hydrobromide treatment group compared to the placebo group with an incidence greater than or equal to 2% are included in Table 1.

The frequency of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to 2 doses of eletriptan hydrobromide were taken within 24 hours. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, age, or race of the patients. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (e.g., SSRIs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants), estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives.








6.2    Post-marketing Experience

The following adverse reaction(s) have been identified during post approval use of eletriptan hydrobromide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Neurological: seizure

Digestive: vomiting
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS


 Eletriptan hydrobromide should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.






Myocardial ischemia/infarction or Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) 
Arrhythmias: Discontinue eletriptan hydrobromide if occurs (5.2)

Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not myocardial ischemia; evaluate high risk patients for CAD (5.3)  

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke: Discontinue eletriptan hydrobromide if occurs (5.4)  

Gastrointestinal ischemia or infarction events, or peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue eletriptan hydrobromide if occurs (5.5)

Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6)  

Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue eletriptan hydrobromide if occurs (5.7
, 7.3)









5.1    Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction and Prinzmetal’s Angina

Eletriptan hydrobromide is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of eletriptan hydrobromide. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD.  Eletriptan hydrobromide may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.
Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving eletriptan hydrobromide. Do not use eletriptan hydrobromide if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)].  For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first eletriptan hydrobromide dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of eletriptan hydrobromide. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of eletriptan hydrobromide.








5.2    Arrhythmias

Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue eletriptan hydrobromide if these disturbances occur. Eletriptan hydrobromide is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)].









5.3    Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure

Sensations of tightness, pain and pressure in the chest, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with eletriptan hydrobromide and are usually non-cardiac in origin.  However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. Eletriptan hydrobromide is contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)].









5.4    Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists and some have resulted in fatalities.  In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.
Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. Eletriptan hydrobromide is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)].









5.5    Other Vasospasm Reactions

Eletriptan hydrobromide may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea) and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional eletriptan hydrobromide doses [see Contraindications (4)].









5.6    Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused acute migraine drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.








5.7    Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome may occur with eletriptan hydrobromide, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue eletriptan hydrobromide if serotonin syndrome is suspected.








5.8    Increase in Blood Pressure

Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with eletriptan hydrobromide. Eletriptan hydrobromide is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)].









5.9    Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions

There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving eletriptan hydrobromide. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Eletriptan hydrobromide tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to eletriptan hydrobromide [see Contraindications (4)].









5.10 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to
Tartrazine

The 20 mg tablets contain FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS






Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 







8.1 Pregnancy


Risk Summary

Available human data on the use of eletriptan hydrobromide in pregnant women are not sufficient to draw conclusions about drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal studies, oral administration of eletriptan during pregnancy or throughout pregnancy and lactation was associated with developmental toxicity (decreased fetal and pup weights, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased pup viability) at clinically-relevant doses [see Data]. 
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. 

Clinical Considerations 


Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy.







Data


Human Data 
A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only. Of the 189 women who redeemed prescriptions for eletriptan during the first trimester, 4 (2.1%) had infants with major congenital malformations, while for the 174 women who redeemed prescriptions for eletriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 11 (6.3%) had infants with major congenital malformations. Methodological limitations of this study, including small size of the eletriptan population and infrequent events, do not allow for thorough characterization of risk. 

Animal Data 

When pregnant rats were administered eletriptan (0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis, fetal weights were decreased and the incidences of vertebral and sternebral variations were increased at 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 80 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were also maternally toxic, as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight gain during gestation. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rats was 30 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.
When eletriptan (0, 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis, fetal weights were decreased at 50 mg/kg/day. The incidences of fused sternebrae and vena cava deviations were increased at all doses. Maternal toxicity was not evident at any dose. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits was not established; the lowest dose tested (5 mg/kg/day) is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 
Oral administration of eletriptan (0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in a decrease in offspring viability and body weight at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats (15 mg/kg/day) is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.










8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

Eletriptan is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effects of eletriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of eletriptan on milk production.
 The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for eletriptan hydrobromide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from eletriptan hydrobromide or from the underlying maternal condition. Infant exposure can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 24 hours after treatment.








8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
The efficacy of eletriptan hydrobromide tablets (40 mg) in patients 11 to 17 was not established in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 274 adolescent migraineurs [see 

Clinical Studies (14)]
. Adverse reactions observed were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Post-marketing experience with other triptans includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced clinically serious adverse reactions that are similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. Long-term safety of eletriptan was studied in 76 adolescent patients who received treatment for up to one year.  A similar profile of adverse reactions to that of adults was observed. The long-term safety of eletriptan in pediatric patients has not been established.








8.5 Geriatric Use

Blood pressure was increased to a greater extent in elderly subjects than in young subjects.  The pharmacokinetic disposition of eletriptan in the elderly is similar to that seen in younger adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In clinical trials, there were no apparent differences in efficacy or the incidence of adverse reactions between patients under 65 years of age and those 65 and above.








8.6    Hepatic Impairment

The effect of severe hepatic impairment on eletriptan hydrobromide metabolism has not been evaluated. Eletriptan hydrobromide is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
.
10 OVERDOSAGE


The elimination half-life of eletriptan is about 4 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
, therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with eletriptan should continue for at least 20 hours or longer while symptoms or signs persist.
There is no specific antidote to eletriptan.
It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentration of eletriptan.
