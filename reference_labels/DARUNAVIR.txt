6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Treatment Naïve-Adults: TMC114-C211

The safety assessment is based on all safety data from the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C211 comparing darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily versus lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day in 689 antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects. The total mean exposure for subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily arm and in the lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day arm was 162.5 and 153.5 weeks, respectively.
The majority of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported during treatment with darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily were mild in severity. The most common clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain and rash. 2.3% of subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir arm discontinued treatment due to ADRs.
ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects are presented in Table 6 and subsequent text below the table.

Treatment-Experienced Adults: TMC114-C214

The safety assessment is based on all safety data from the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C214 comparing darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily versus lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily in 595 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adult subjects. The total mean exposure for subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily arm and in the lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily arm was 80.7 and 76.4 weeks, respectively.
The majority of the ADRs reported during treatment with darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily were mild in severity. The most common clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting. 4.7% of subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir arm discontinued treatment due to ADRs.

Serious ADRs

The following serious ADRs of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) occurred in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials with darunavir/ritonavir: abdominal pain, acute hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, anorexia, asthenia, diabetes mellitus, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, hepatic enzyme increased, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, low density lipoprotein increased, nausea, pancreatic enzyme increased, rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and vomiting.

Patients Co-Infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus

In subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving darunavir/ritonavir, the incidence of adverse events and clinical chemistry abnormalities was not higher than in subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir who were not co-infected, except for increased hepatic enzymes [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.2

)]. The pharmacokinetic exposure in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection.

Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients

Darunavir/ritonavir has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 3 Phase 2 trials. TMC114-C212, in which 80 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 6 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 20 kg were included, TMC114-C228, in which 21 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 6 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg were included, and TMC114-C230 in which 12 antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected pediatric patients aged from 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg were included. The TMC114-C212 and C228 trials evaluated darunavir/ritonavir twice daily dosing and the TMC114-C230 trial evaluated darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (

8.4

) and Clinical Studies (

14.4

)].
Frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults.

TMC114-C212

Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (13%), diarrhea (11%), abdominal pain (10%), headache (9%), rash (5%), nausea (4%), and fatigue (3%).
Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), AST increased (Grade 3: 1%), pancreatic amylase increased (Grade 3: 4%, Grade 4: 1%), pancreatic lipase increased (Grade 3: 1%), total cholesterol increased (Grade 3: 1%), and LDL increased (Grade 3: 3%).

TMC114-C228

Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 5%), were diarrhea (24%), vomiting (19%), rash (19%), abdominal pain (5%), and anorexia (5%).
There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this trial.

TMC114-C230

Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (33%), nausea (25%), diarrhea (16.7%), abdominal pain (8.3%), decreased appetite (8.3%), pruritus (8.3%), and rash (8.3%). 
There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this trial.








6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of darunavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Redistribution of body fat.
 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and darunavir/ritonavir).
 
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.3

)]


Renal and Urinary Disorders: Crystal nephropathy, crystalluria
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS






  Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with darunavir/ritonavir. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. (
5.2
)
  Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, have been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. (
5.3
)
  Use with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (
5.4
)
  Patients may develop new onset diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. (
5.6
)
  Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat or immune reconstitution syndrome. (
5.7
, 
5.8
)
  Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. (
5.9
)
  Darunavir/ritonavir is not recommended in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir up to days 23 to 26 of age. (
5.10
)








5.1 Importance of Co-administration with Ritonavir

Darunavir tablets must be co-administered with ritonavir and food to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Failure to administer darunavir tablets with ritonavir and food may result in a loss of efficacy of darunavir.
Please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for additional information on precautionary measures.








5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with darunavir/ritonavir. During the clinical development program (N=3063), hepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving combination therapy with darunavir/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse events.
Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with darunavir/ritonavir therapy has not been established.
Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with darunavir/ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of darunavir/ritonavir treatment.
Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on darunavir/ritonavir should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment.








5.3 Severe Skin Reactions

During the clinical development program (n=3063), severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, have been reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue darunavir/ritonavir immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia.
Rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in 10.3% of subjects treated with darunavir/ritonavir [see Adverse Reactions (

6

)]. Rash was mostly mild-to-moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing. The discontinuation rate due to rash in subjects using darunavir/ritonavir was 0.5%.
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing darunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir without darunavir/ritonavir. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.








5.4 Sulfa Allergy

Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Darunavir tablets should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. In clinical studies with darunavir/ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy.








5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of darunavir/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving darunavir/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A and reduce plasma concentrations of active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A.
Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of darunavir/ritonavir, respectively. 
These interactions may lead to:

Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of darunavir/ritonavir.
Loss of therapeutic effect of the concomitant medications from lower exposures of active metabolite(s).
Loss of therapeutic effect of darunavir/ritonavir and possible development of resistance from lower exposures of darunavir/ritonavir.

See Table 10 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (

7

)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during darunavir/ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during darunavir/ritonavir therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (

4

) and Drug Interactions (

7

)].








5.6 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia

New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between PI therapy and these events have not been established.








5.7 Fat Redistribution

Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.








5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including darunavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr¡SR syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment.








5.9 Hemophilia

There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established.








5.10 Not Recommended in Pediatric Patients Below 3 Years of Age

Darunavir/ritonavir in pediatric patients below 3 years of age is not recommended in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir (from 20 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg) up to days 23 to 26 of age [see Use in Specific Populations (

8.1 

and 

8.4

) and Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS






  Pregnancy: Total darunavir exposures were generally lower during pregnancy compared to postpartum period. The reduction in darunavir exposures during pregnancy were greater for once daily dosing compared to the twice daily dosing regimen. (
8.1
, 
12.3
)
  Lactation: Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission. (
8.2
)
  Pediatrics: Not recommended for patients less than 3 years of age. (
8.4
)








8.1 Pregnancy


Pregnancy Exposure Registry 

 
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to darunavir during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) 1-800-258-4263. 
 

Risk Summary 

 
Prospective pregnancy data from the APR are not sufficient to adequately assess the risk of birth
defects or miscarriage. Available limited data from the APR show no statistically significant difference in the overall risk of major birth defects for darunavir compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) [see Data]. 
 
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15-20%. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 
 
Studies in animals did not show evidence of developmental toxicity. Exposures (based on AUC) in rats were 3-fold higher, whereas in mice and rabbits, exposures were lower (less than 1-fold) than human exposures at the recommended daily dose [see Data].

Clinical Considerations 

 
The recommended dosage in pregnant patients is darunavir 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food. 
 
Darunavir 800 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily should only be considered in certain pregnant patients who are already on a stable darunavir 800 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily regimen prior to pregnancy, are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL), and in whom a change to twice daily darunavir 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may compromise tolerability or compliance [see Dosage and Administration (

2.4

) and Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].

Darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily) in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 36 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum. Eighteen subjects were enrolled in each BID and QD treatment arms. Twenty-nine subjects completed the trial through the postpartum period (6-12 weeks after delivery) and 7 subjects discontinued before trial completion, 5 subjects in the BID arm and 2 subjects in the QD arm. 
 
The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that exposure to darunavir and ritonavir as part of an antiretroviral regimen was lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6-12 weeks). Exposure reductions during pregnancy were greater for the once daily regimen as compared to the twice daily regimen [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].

 
Virologic response was preserved. In the BID arm, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL were 39% (7/18) at baseline, 61% (11/18) through the third trimester visit, and 61% (11/18) through the 6-12 week postpartum visit. Virologic outcomes during the third trimester visit showed HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL for 11% (2/18) of subjects and were missing for 5 subjects (1 subject discontinued prematurely due to virologic failure). In the QD arm, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL were 61% (11/18) at baseline, 83% (15/18) through the third trimester visit, and 78% (14/18) through the 6-12 week postpartum visit. Virologic outcomes during the third trimester visit showed HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL for none of the subjects and were missing for 3 subjects (1 subject discontinued prematurely due to virologic failure).
 
Darunavir/ritonavir was well tolerated during pregnancy and postpartum. There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir in HIV-1-infected adults.
 
Among the 31 infants with HIV test results available data, born to the 31 HIV-infected pregnant women who completed trial through delivery or postpartum period, all 31 infants had test results that were negative for HIV-1 at the time of delivery and/or through 16 weeks postpartum. All 31 infants received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment containing zidovudine.
 
Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 980 exposures to darunavir-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 660 exposed in the first trimester and over 320 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.6.% (95% CI: 2.3% to 5.3.%) with first trimester exposure to darunavir-containing regimens and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1% to 4.8%) with second/third trimester exposure to darunavir-containing regimens. 
 

Animal Data 

 
Reproduction studies conducted with darunavir showed no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in mice (doses up to 1000 mg/kg from gestation day (GD) 6-15 with darunavir alone) and rats (doses up to 1000 mg/kg from GD 7-19 in the presence or absence of ritonavir) as well as in rabbits (doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day from GD 8-20 with darunavir alone). In these studies, darunavir exposures (based on AUC) were higher in rats (3-fold), whereas in mice and rabbits, exposures were lower (less than 1-fold) compared to those obtained in humans at the recommended clinical dose of darunavir boosted with ritonavir.
 








8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. 
There are no data on the presence of darunavir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Darunavir is present in the milk of lactating rats [see Data]. Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving darunavir [see Use in Specific Populations (

8.4

)].

Data 


Animal Data 

Studies in rats (with darunavir alone or with ritonavir) have demonstrated that darunavir is secreted in the milk. In the rat pre- and postnatal development study, a reduction in pup body weight gain was observed due to exposure of pups to drug substances via milk. The maximal maternal plasma exposures achieved with darunavir (up to 1000 mg/kg with ritonavir) were approximately 50% of those obtained in humans at the recommended clinical dose with ritonavir.








8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential


Contraception 

Use of darunavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives and the progestin only pill. Advise patients to use an effective alternative (non-hormonal) contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception. For co-administration with drospirenone, clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (

7.3

)].








8.4 Pediatric Use

Darunavir/ritonavir is not recommended in pediatric patients below 3 years of age because of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir (from 20 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg) up to days 23 to 26 of age [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.10

), Use in Specific Populations (

8.1

) and Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].
The safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and virologic and immunologic responses of darunavir/ritonavir administered twice daily were evaluated in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg. These subjects were evaluated in clinical trials TMC114-C212 (80 subjects, 6 to less than 18 years of age) and TMC114-228 (21 subjects, 3 to less than 6 years of age) [see Adverse Reactions (

6.1

), Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

) and Clinical Studies (

14.4

)]. Frequency, type, and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (

6.1

)]. Refer to Dosage and Administration (2.5) for twice-daily dosing recommendations for pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg.
In clinical trial TMC114-C230, the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and virologic and immunologic responses of darunavir/ritonavir administered once daily were evaluated in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age (12 subjects) [see Adverse Reactions (

6.1

), Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

) and Clinical Studies (

14.4

)]. Frequency, type, and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (

6.1

)]. Once daily dosing recommendations for pediatric patients 3 to less than 12 years of age were derived using population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Although a darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing pediatric trial was not conducted in children less than 12 years of age, there is sufficient clinical safety data to support the predicted darunavir exposures for the dosing recommendations in this age group [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. Please see Dosage and Administration (

2.5

) for once-daily dosing recommendations for pediatric subjects 3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg.

Juvenile Animal Data 

In a juvenile toxicity study where rats were directly dosed with darunavir (up to 1000 mg/kg), deaths occurred from post-natal day 5 at plasma exposure levels ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 of the human exposure levels. In a 4-week rat toxicology study, when dosing was initiated on post-natal day 23 (the human equivalent of 2 to 3 years of age), no deaths were observed with a plasma exposure (in combination with ritonavir) 2 times the human plasma exposure levels.








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of darunavir did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of darunavir in elderly patients, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].








8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of darunavir/ritonavir is necessary for patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of darunavir/ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, darunavir/ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (

2.6

) and Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].








8.7 Renal Impairment

Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of darunavir were not significantly affected in HIV-infected subjects with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30-60 mL/min, n=20). No pharmacokinetic data are available in HIV-1-infected patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease; however, because the renal clearance of darunavir is limited, a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].
10 OVERDOSAGE

Human experience of acute overdose with darunavir/ritonavir is limited. No specific antidote is available for overdose with darunavir. Treatment of overdose with darunavir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Since darunavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the active substance.
