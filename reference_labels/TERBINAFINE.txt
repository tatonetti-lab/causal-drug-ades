6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequently reported adverse events observed in the 3 US/Canadian placebo-controlled trials are listed in the Table 1. The adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. Changes in the ocular lens and retina have been reported following the use of Terbinafine tablets in controlled trials. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation from study participation.

5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Prior to initiating treatment and periodically during therapy, assess liver function tests. Discontinue Terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. (
  
     5.1)
 
    
Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of Terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue Terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (
  
     5.2)
 
    
Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of Terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue Terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (
  
     5.3)
 
    
Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms. (
  
     5.4)
 
    
Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is
  
     less than or equal to1000 cells/mm
  
     3, Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (
  
     5.5)
 
    
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If signs or symptoms of drug reaction occur, treatment with Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (
  
     5.6)
 
    








5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Terbinafine tablets, perform liver function tests because hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without preexisting liver disease. Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of Terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease.
In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of Terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Discontinue Terbinafine tablets if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.
Warn patients prescribed Terbinafine tablets and/or their caregivers to report immediately to their healthcare providers any symptoms or signs of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Advise patients with these symptoms to discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and immediately evaluate the patient's liver function.








5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste

Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of Terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.








5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell

Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of Terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.








5.4 Depressive Symptoms

Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of Terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician.








5.5 Hematologic Effects

Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 subjects receiving Terbinafine tablets (1.7%) and 3/137 subjects receiving placebo (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm
 
  3on 2 or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than 6 weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of Terbinafine tablets, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is
 
  less than or equal to1000 cells/mm
 
  3, Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued and supportive management started.

 








5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.








5.7 Lupus Erythematosus

During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking Terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus.








5.8 Thrombotic Microangiopathy

Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with terbinafine. Discontinue terbinafine if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur. The findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and anemia should prompt further evaluation and consideration of diagnosis of TMA.
8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





8.1 Pregnancy







Risk Summary

Available data from postmarketing cases on the use of Terbinafine Tablets in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.
In animal reproduction studies, terbinafine did not cause malformations or any harm to the fetus when administered to pregnant rabbits and rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 12 and 23 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 250 mg/day, respectively
 
  (see
  
   data).
 
  

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown; however, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.











Data










Animal Data

In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received orally (by gavage) doses of terbinafine up to 300 mg/kg/day, during the period of organogenesis. There were no maternal or embryo-fetal effects in either species up to the maximum dose tested. The 300 mg/kg/day dose level in rats and rabbits corresponds to 23 and 12 times the MRHD [based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons], respectively.
In a rat peri- and postnatal development study, terbinafine doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) given by oral gavage during late pregnancy and lactation (Day 15 of gestation to day 20 post-partum) had no adverse effects on parturition and lactation.












8.2 Lactation







Risk Summary

After oral administration, terbinafine is present in human milk. However, there are no data on the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Terbinafine tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Terbinafine tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.










8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of Terbinafine tablets have not been established in pediatric patients with onychomycosis.








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Terbinafine tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.








8.6 Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min), the use of Terbinafine tablets has not been adequately studied.








8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4)and
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 
  . Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of Terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease.
10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical experience regarding overdose with oral terbinafine is limited. Doses up to 5 grams (20 times the therapeutic daily dose) have been taken without inducing serious adverse reactions. The symptoms of overdose included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, frequent urination, and headache.
