6	ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.







• Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) of moderate or severe intensity in adults and adolescents (13 years and older) are diarrhea, nausea, rash, and flatulence (6.1).

• Most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients (2 to less than 13 years) are diarrhea, leukopenia/neutropenia, rash, anorexia, and abdominal pain. (6.2)

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience: Adults and Adolescents (13 years and older)

The safety of VIRACEPT was studied in over 5000 patients who received drug either alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues. The majority of adverse events were of mild intensity. The most frequently reported adverse event among patients receiving VIRACEPT was diarrhea, which was generally of mild to moderate intensity.
Drug-related clinical adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity in ≥2% of patients treated with VIRACEPT coadministered with d4T and 3TC (Study 542) for up to 48 weeks, or with ZDV plus 3TC (Study 511) for up to 24 weeks are presented in Table 4.

6.2	Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatrics (2 to less than 13 years of age)

VIRACEPT has been studied in approximately 400 pediatric patients in clinical trials from birth to 13 years of age. The adverse event profile seen during pediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adults.
The most commonly reported drug-related, treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the pediatric studies included: diarrhea, leukopenia/neutropenia, rash, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Diarrhea, regardless of assigned relationship to study drug, was reported in 39% to 47% of pediatric patients receiving VIRACEPT in 2 of the larger treatment trials. Leukopenia/neutropenia was the laboratory abnormality most commonly reported as a significant event across the pediatric studies.








6.3	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIRACEPT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Body as a Whole: hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, moderate to severe rash, fever, and edema).

Cardiovascular System: QTc prolongation, torsades de pointes.

Digestive System: jaundice.

Metabolic/Nutritional System: bilirubinemia, metabolic acidosis.
5	WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS


ALERT: Find out about medicines that should not be taken with VIRACEPT. This statement is included on the product's bottle label.






ALERT: Find out about medicines that should not be taken with VIRACEPT.



•The concomitant use of VIRACEPT and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions (5.1, 7.3)

•Hepatic impairment: should not be used in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment (2.4, 5.2)

• Phenylketonuria: the oral powder contains 11.2 mg phenylalanine per gram of powder (5.3)

•Diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia: new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia reported with protease inhibitors. In some cases after treatment discontinuation, hyperglycemia persisted (5.4)

•Hemophilia: increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis reported with protease inhibitors. In more than half of the cases, protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced (5.5)

•Fat redistribution: observed with antiretroviral therapy (5.6)

• Immune reconstitution syndrome: reported with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRACEPT. Patients may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (5.7)








5.1	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of VIRACEPT, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving VIRACEPT, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of VIRACEPT, respectively. These interactions may lead to:


•Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.

•Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of VIRACEPT.

•Loss of therapeutic effect of VIRACEPT and possible development of resistance.

 See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during VIRACEPT therapy; review concomitant medications during VIRACEPT therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 









5.2	Hepatic Impairment 

VIRACEPT should not be used in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C, score greater than or equal to 7) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









5.3	Phenylketonurics

Viracept Oral Powder contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each gram of VIRACEPT powder contains 11.2 mg phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria.








5.4	Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia

New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.








5.5	Hemophilia

There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship has not been established.








5.6	Fat Redistribution

Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement ("buffalo hump"), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.








5.7	Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIRACEPT. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
8	USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS






•Use during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus (8.1)

•Lactation: Patients infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission (8.2)








8.1	Pregnancy







Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to VIRACEPT during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.










Risk Summary

Published reports of hepatic adverse events ranging from elevated liver enzymes to hepatic failure in pregnant patients exposed to nelfinavir have been reported (see 
Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.
). Due to VIRACEPT's overall adverse event profile, including hepatic adverse events, and literature reports of decreased exposures in second and third trimesters, consider alternative antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy.
Available data from the APR suggests a statistically significant increase in overall risks of major birth defects with first trimester exposure with nelfinavir (3.9%) when compared with the background rate of 2.7% in one U.S. reference population (the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program [MACDP]), but the risk is similar to the background rate of 4.2% reported in another U.S. reference population (the Texas Birth Defects Registry [TBDR]). No pattern of defects was identified by the APR. The clinical relevance of this statistical finding is uncertain (see 
Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.
).
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% respectively.
In animal reproductive studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed when nelfinavir was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at systemic exposures similar to or less than human exposure (based on AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively (see 
Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.
).










Clinical Considerations









Maternal Adverse Reactions

There have been reports of hepatic adverse events ranging from elevated liver enzymes to hepatic failure in pregnant patients receiving nelfinavir as part of combination treatment of HIV-1 infection. Consider alternative antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy. If VIRACEPT is used during pregnancy, clinical monitoring is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].












Data









Human Data

Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 1,200 live births following first trimester and over 2,700 live births following second and third trimester exposure to nelfinavir-containing regimens, there was an increase in overall rates of major birth defects (n=47) with nelfinavir when compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.9% (95% CI: 2.9% to 5.1%) with first trimester exposure to nelfinavir-containing regimens and 3.1% (95% CI: 2.5% to 3.9%) with the second/third trimester exposure to nelfinavir-containing regimens. The rate for nelfinavir-containing regimens is greater than the overall rates of defects in the MACDP (2.7%) but less than rates of defects in the TBDR (4.2%). Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease; these limitations preclude an accurate comparison of outcomes. The MACDP population is not disease specific, evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area, and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at <20 weeks gestation.










Animal Data

Nelfinavir was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, from gestation day 6 to 17 (rats) and 7 to 20 (rabbits). There were no effects on fetal development or maternal toxicity when nelfinavir was administered to pregnant rats at systemic exposures (AUC) similar to human exposure. Administration of nelfinavir to pregnant rabbits resulted in no fetal development effects up to a dose at which a slight decrease in maternal body weight was observed; however, even at the highest dose evaluated, systemic exposure in rabbits was significantly lower than human exposure. Additional studies in rats indicated that exposure to nelfinavir in females from mid-pregnancy through lactation (gestation day 6 to lactation day 20) had no effect on the survival, growth, and development of the offspring. Subsequent reproductive performance of these offspring was also not affected by maternal exposure to nelfinavir.












8.2 Lactation







Risk Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected patients in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking potential transmission of HIV-1 infection. Based on limited published data, nelfinavir is present in low levels in human milk, and adverse effects in infants exposed to nelfinavir have been reported. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving VIRACEPT.










8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential







Contraception

Use of VIRACEPT may reduce the efficacy of estrogen-based oral contraceptives. Advise patients to use alternative or additional contraceptive measures when oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone and VIRACEPT are coadministered [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].










8.4	Pediatric Use

The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of VIRACEPT were evaluated in HIV infected pediatric patients from 2 to 13 years of age in multicenter clinical trials, Study 556 and PACTG 337 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. In patients less than 2 years of age, VIRACEPT was found to be safe at the doses studied, but a reliably effective dose could not be established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions  (6.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The pharmacokinetic profile, safety and antiviral activity of VIRACEPT in adolescent patients 13 years and older is supported by data from the adult clinical trials where some trials allowed enrolment of subjects 13 years and older. Thus, the data for adolescents and adults were analyzed collectively. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].








8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of VIRACEPT did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.








8.6	Hepatic Impairment

VIRACEPT should not be used in patients with either moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C, score greater than or equal to 7) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
 and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment of VIRACEPT is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, score 5–6).








8.7	Renal Impairment

The safety and efficacy of VIRACEPT have not been established in patients with renal impairment.
10	OVERDOSAGE

Human experience of acute overdose with VIRACEPT is limited. There is no specific antidote for overdose with VIRACEPT. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. Since nelfinavir is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to significantly remove drug from blood.
