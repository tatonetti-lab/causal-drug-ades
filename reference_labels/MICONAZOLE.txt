6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
         
 
  

The overall safety of ORAVIG was assessed in 480 adult subjects: 315 HIV-infected subjects, 147 subjects with head and neck cancer, and 18 healthy subjects. 



HIV Infected Patients
           
   
    

Two trials were conducted in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients: one randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled design (N = 290 ORAVIG, 287 control) and one non-comparative trial (N = 25).
         
 
  





In the randomized, double blind trial (Study 1), 290 HIV infected subjects used ORAVIG once daily for 14 days, and 287 subjects used 10 mg clotrimazole troches five times daily for 14 days. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in either treatment are presented in Table 1.

Overall local adverse reactions, including oral discomfort, oral burning, oral pain, gingival pain, gingival swelling, gingival pruritis, tongue ulceration, mouth ulceration, glossodynia, dry mouth, application site pain or discomfort, toothache, loss of taste, and altered taste, were reported by 35 (12.1%) patients who received miconazole buccal tablet compared to 27 (9.4%) patients who received clotrimazole troches. 



 Head and Neck Cancer Patients
           
   
    

In the randomized, open-label comparative trial of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with head and neck cancer who had received radiation therapy (Study 2), 147 patients used ORAVIG once daily for 14 days and 147 patients used 125 mg of miconazole oral gel four times daily for 14 days. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥2% of patients in either arm are listed in Table 2.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS




Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving miconazole. Discontinue ORAVIG immediately at the first sign of hypersensitivity (5.1).







5.1 Hypersensitivity

Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and hypersensitivity, have been reported with the administration of miconazole products, including ORAVIG.  Discontinue ORAVIG immediately at the first sign of hypersensitivity.
         
 
  

There is no information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between miconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Monitor patients with a history of hypersensitivity to azoles.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause     fetal harm (8.1).
Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy not     established in patients less than 16 years of age (8.4). 


See 12 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling                                                                                                                                                    








8.1 Pregnancy


Risk Summary

Based on findings from animal data, ORAVIG may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. 
         There are no available data on ORAVIG use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.   In animal reproduction studies, prolonged gestation, dystocia and/or increased number of resorptions were observed after oral administration of miconazole nitrate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits. 
         
 
  (See Data).  Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
        

 
 The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.  All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.
 
         
 
  Data


Animal Data:  

Miconazole nitrate administered orally at doses of 80 mg/kg/day or higher to pregnant rats or rabbits crossed the placenta and resulted in embryo- and fetotoxicity, including increased fetal resorptions. These doses also resulted in prolonged gestation and dystocia in rats, but not in rabbits.  Embryofetotoxicity was not observed in intravenous studies with miconazole at lower doses of 40 mg/kg/day in rats and 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, which are approximately 8 times higher than the dose a patient would receive if she swallowed an ORAVIG buccal tablet, based on body surface area comparisons. Teratogenicity was not reported in any animal study with miconazole.
         
 
   









8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

There 
         is no available information on the presence of miconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production following use of ORAVIG.
        
 The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ORAVIG and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ORAVIG or from the underlying maternal condition.








8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ORAVIG in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established. The ability of pediatric patients to comply with the application instructions has not been evaluated. Use in younger children is not recommended due to potential risk of choking.








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of ORAVIG did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 








8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Miconazole is metabolized by the liver.  While miconazole systemic exposure is minimal following the application of ORAVIG, ORAVIG should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
         
 
  









8.7 Renal Impairment

Less than 1% of miconazole is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine; therefore, no adjustment to therapy is necessary in patients with renal impairment.
10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdose with miconazole in humans has not been reported in the literature.
Miconazole absorption and systemic exposure following application of ORAVIG are minimal 
       
 
  
[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Symptomatic and supportive care is the basis for management.
