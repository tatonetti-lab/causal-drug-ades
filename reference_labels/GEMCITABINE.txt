6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.








Single-Agent

The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m
 
  2to 1250 mg/m
 
  2intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly in 979 patients with various malignancies. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of single-agent gemcitabine are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (≥5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued gemcitabine due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse reactions (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in < 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema.

 

Tables 5and 6 present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in patients with various malignancies receiving single agent gemcitabine across 5 clinical trials. Additional clinically significant adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities are provided following Table

Ovarian Cancer


Tables 7and
 
  8present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, occurring in ≥10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine with carboplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 1) of gemcitabine plus carboplatin (n=175) compared to carboplatin alone (n=174) for the second-line treatment of ovarian cancer in women with disease that had relapsed more than 6 months following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.1)]
 
  .

 
Additional clinically significant adverse reactions, occurring in < 10% of patients, are provided following
 
  Table 8.

 
The proportion of patients with dose adjustments for carboplatin (1.8% versus 3.8%), doses of carboplatin omitted (0.2% versus 0) and discontinuing treatment for adverse reactions (11% versus 10%), were similar between arms. Dose adjustment for gemcitabine occurred in 10% of patients and gemcitabine dose was omitted in 14% of patients in the gemcitabine/ carboplatin arm.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:


Table 11and
 
  12present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 3) of gemcitabine with cisplatin (n=260) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=262) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.3)]
 
  .

 
Patients randomized to gemcitabine with cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine with cisplatin compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (3% versus <1%), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

Tables 13 and 14present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 4) of gemcitabine with cisplatin (n=69) administered in 21-day cycles as compared to etoposide with cisplatin (n=66) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.3)]
 
  . Additional clinically significant adverse reactions are provided following Table 14.

 
Patients in the gemcitabine/ cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/ cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for adverse reactions was 22% in the GC arm and 27% in the EC arm. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment for adverse reactions was higher in the GC arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients who were hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the GC arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the GC arm.

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood and Lymphatic System:TMA

 

Cardiovascular— congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias

 

Vascular Disorders— peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome

 

Skin— cellulitis, pseudocellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions

 

Hepatic— hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease

 

Pulmonary— interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary eosinophilia

 

Nervous System— posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS






Schedule-dependent toxicity:Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (
  
     5.1)
 
    

Myelosuppression:Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (
  
     5.2,
  
     5.7)
 
    

Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure:Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection for unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (
  
     5.3)
 
    

Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS):Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection for HUS or severe renal impairment. (
  
     5.4)
 
    

Hepatoxicity:Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (
  
     5.5)
 
    

Embryo-Fetal toxicity:Can cause fetal harm. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. (
  
     5.6,
  
     8.1)
 
    

Exacerbation of radiation therapy toxicity:May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (
  
     5.7)
 
    

Capillary leak syndrome:Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection. (
  
     5.8)
 
    

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES):Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection. (
  
     5.9)
 
    








5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity

In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . [Refer to the recommended Gemcitabine Injection dosing schedule
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1,
  
   2.2,
  
   2.3, and
  
   2.4)].
 
  ]

 








5.2 Myelosuppression

Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of the 979 patients who received single-agent gemcitabine. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8% to 28%, and 5% to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with another drug
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1)].
 
  Prior to each dose of Gemcitabine Injection, obtain a complete blood count (CBC), with a differential and a platelet count. Modify the Gemcitabine Injection dosage as recommended
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1,
  
   2.2,
  
   2.3, and
  
   2.4)]
 
  .

 








5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure

Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1,
  
   6.2)]
 
  .

 
Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity.








5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis, can occur with gemcitabine. In clinical trials, HUS occurred in 0.25% of 2429 patients. Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1)]
 
  . Serious cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) other than HUS have been reported with gemcitabine
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)].
 
  

Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine Injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develop anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis; increased bilirubin or LDH; reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or renal failure (increased serum creatinine or BUN). Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy.








5.5 Hepatic Toxicity

Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1and
  
   6.2)]
 
  . Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent hepatic metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency.

 
Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine Injection and periodically during treatment. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection in patients that develop severe liver injury.








5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on animal data and its mechanism of action Gemcitabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the final dose
 
  [see Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.1), (
  
   8.3)]
 
  .

 








5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity

Gemcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with radiation therapy.








Concurrent (given together or ≤7 days apart)

Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m
 
  2to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation.

 










Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart)

Excessive toxicity has not been observed when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive gemcitabine after prior radiation.










5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome

Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)]
 
  . Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection if CLS develops during therapy.

 








5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)]
 
  . PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances.

 
Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine Injection if PRES develops during therapy.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS




Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (
 
    8.2)

   







8.1 Pregnancy







Risk Summary

Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, Gemcitabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.1)]
 
  . There are no available data on the use of gemcitabine in pregnant women. In animal reproductive studies, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits
 
  [see
  
   Data].
 
  Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus
 
  [see
  
   Use in Special Populations(
  
   8.3)].
 
  

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.










Data


Animal Data

Gemcitabine is embryotoxic in mice. Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant mice increased the incidence of fetal malformation (cleft palate, incomplete ossification) at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day in mice [approximately 0.005 times the 1000 mg/m
 
  2clinical dose based on body surface area (BSA)]. Gemcitabine was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rabbits. Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant rabbits resulted in fetotoxicity (decreased fetal viability, reduced litter sizes, and developmental delays) and increased the incidence of fetal malformations (fused pulmonary artery, absence of gall bladder) at doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.002 times the 1000 mg/m
 
  2clinical dose based on BSA)

 










8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of gemcitabine or its metabolites in human milk, or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise a women not to breastfeed during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for one week following the last dose.








8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential


Pregnancy Testing

Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Gemcitabine Injection
 
  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].


Contraception

Gemcitabine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman
 
  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].


Females

Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine Injection and for 6 months after the final dose
 
  .


Males

Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the final dose of
 
  [see Nonclinical Toxicology (
  
   13.1)].
 
  


Infertility


Males

Based on animal studies, Gemcitabine Injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential
 
  [see Nonclinical Toxicology (
  
   13.1)].
 
  It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible.
 
  









8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of gemcitabine have not been established in pediatric patients.
The safety and pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial of pediatric patients with refractory leukaemia. The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg/m
 
  2/min for 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one-week rest period.

 
The safety and activity of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial of pediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (22 patients) and acute myelogenous leukemia (10 patients) at a dose of 10 mg/m
 
  2/min administered over 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one-week rest period. Patients with M1 or M2 bone marrow on day 28 who did not experience unacceptable toxicity were eligible to receive a maximum of one additional four-week course. Toxicities observed included myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, increased serum transaminases, nausea, and rash/desquamation. No meaningful clinical activity was observed in this trial.

 








8.5 Geriatric Use

In clinical studies which enrolled 979 patients with various malignancies who received single agent gemcitabine, no overall differences in safety were observed between patients aged 65 and older and younger patients, with the exception of a higher rate of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in older patients compared to younger patients. In a randomized trial in women with ovarian cancer (Study 1), 175 women received gemcitabine with carboplatin, of which 29% were age 65 years or older. Similar effectiveness was observed between older and younger women. There was significantly higher Grade 3-4 neutropenia in women 65 years of age or older
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1)
 
  ]. Gemcitabine clearance is affected by age; however, there are no recommended dose adjustments based on patients’ age
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].
 
  









8.6 Gender

Gemcitabine clearance is decreased in females
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . In single-agent studies of gemcitabine, women, especially older women, were more likely not to proceed to a subsequent cycle and to experience Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1,
  
   2.2,
  
   2.3,
  
   2.4)
 
  ].
10 OVERDOSAGE

There is no known antidote for overdoses of gemcitabine. Myelosuppression, paresthesias, and severe rash were the principal toxicities seen when a single dose as high as 5700 mg/m
 
  2was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks to several patients in a dose-escalation study. In the event of suspected overdose, monitor with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive therapy, as necessary.
