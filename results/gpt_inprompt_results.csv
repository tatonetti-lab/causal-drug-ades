acute kidney injury,3-iodobenzylguanidine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury (AKI) indeed appears to be an adverse reaction associated with the drug 3-iodobenzylguanidine, known by its trade name AZEDRA. The clinical evidence supporting the relationship between AKI and drug exposure can be found in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.6) of the drug label:

- In studies, 7% of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA developed renal failure or acute kidney injury.
- Additionally, 22% of these patients demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured at 6 or 12 months.

It is also noted in the Warnings and Precautions section that patients with baseline renal impairment may be at greater risk of toxicity and that increased monitoring should occur in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. AZEDRA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).

The clinical trials referenced include Study IB12, a dose-finding study in adult patients, and Study IB12B, a single-arm study in both adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, as well as data from 11 patients enrolled in an expanded access program for Study IB12B.

While the drug label provides specific warnings about renal toxicity and indicates that some patients have developed acute kidney injury following administration of AZEDRA, precise details from the individual clinical trial data regarding the incidence of AKI or the conditions under which it occurred are not provided. Nonetheless, the drug label suggests a clear association between the use of AZEDRA and the potential development of acute kidney injury in some patients. No additional sources outside of the drug label were provided or referenced in the summary request.",NA
acute kidney injury,6-aminocaproic acid,,"The drug label for 6-aminocaproic acid indicates that renal-related adverse effects have been observed. Specifically, it mentions ""BUN increased"" and ""renal failure"" under the Urogenital category of adverse reactions. An increase in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) levels is often associated with impaired kidney function, and renal failure is a severe instance of kidney injury. While the label's adverse reactions section does not explicitly state ""acute kidney injury,"" renal failure can be a manifestation of acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of drug exposure.

However, to fully evaluate the evidence supporting acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to 6-aminocaproic acid, information from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance studies would be required. The label does not provide detailed information on the incidence of these adverse events or their direct relation to drug exposure, making it difficult to assess causality solely based on these listed reactions.

In the absence of specific clinical trial data, case studies, or detailed post-marketing surveillance data provided on the label, it is essential to carefully review medical literature for documented cases or research that has investigated this potential relationship. If no such evidence exists or is available at the time of inquiry, or if the provided drug label is the only source of information, then the evidence for a direct causal relationship between 6-aminocaproic acid and acute kidney injury would be considered limited and less robust than if corroborated by additional studies.

In summary, the drug label for 6-aminocaproic acid indicates potential kidney-related adverse effects, including increased BUN levels and renal failure, which might imply a possibility of acute kidney injury. However, without direct evidence from controlled studies or robust post-marketing surveillance data, causality cannot be established with certainty. Further research in the form of clinical trials or case studies is needed to confirm this association and elucidate the mechanisms involved.",NA
