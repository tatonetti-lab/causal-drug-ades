acute kidney injury,3-iodobenzylguanidine,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to 3-iodobenzylguanidine (Iobenguane I-131, marketed as AZEDRA), can be extracted from the provided drug label, particularly focusing on sections related to adverse reactions and warnings.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The clinical trials data are derived from two studies (IB12 and IB12B) which included 88 patients with iobenguane-scan positive recurrent or unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL). Renal toxicity, which could potentially include acute kidney injury, was mentioned as a serious adverse event to monitor for during and after treatment with AZEDRA (Section 5.6).

From section 5.6, it is noted that:
- Among the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA, 7% developed renal failure or acute kidney injury.
- Additionally, 22% demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured at 6 or 12 months.

Considering patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction were excluded from the trials, the observed renal toxicity could be directly correlated to AZEDRA exposure in patients with otherwise normal renal function.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
No specific data from post-marketing surveillance was detailed in the provided text. If acute kidney injury had been noted post-approval, it could potentially be reported by healthcare professionals or patients to the manufacturer (Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc) or the FDA's MedWatch program. However, updates to drug labels and new safety information are usually informed by such reports, implying the clinical trials provide the main source of adverse event information in this case.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided drug label, there is evidence from clinical trials that supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and treatment with AZEDRA. This data specifically points to an incidence rate of renal adverse effects in treated patients. No information from post-marketing sources was provided or indicated in the excerpt, which would limit the summary to clinical trial data only.

It is essential to recognize that all pharmacovigilance conclusions are subject to continual reassessment as new data becomes available from ongoing monitoring of drug safety.",NA
acute kidney injury,6-aminocaproic acid,,"The available evidence for the relationship between acute kidney injury and 6-aminocaproic acid comes from the adverse reactions section of the drug label, which includes post-marketing surveillance data. Specifically, the label mentions ""renal failure"" as one of the reported adverse experiences. However, it is important to note that the term ""renal failure"" encompasses a range of renal impairments, which can include acute kidney injury (AKI).

Nevertheless, the label does not provide detailed information about the incidence, the exact nature of the renal failure, or the causality of this event with respect to 6-aminocaproic acid exposure. The drug label broadly categorizes adverse reactions reported during post-marketing but without specific clinical context or study data.

To establish a clear and direct relationship between 6-aminocaproic acid and acute kidney injury, more detailed evidence would be necessary, such as case reports that uniquely identify this drug as the likely cause of AKI, or clinical trial data that statistically associates the incidence of AKI with exposure to the drug in comparison to a control group not receiving the drug.

Thus, while renal failure is listed as an adverse reaction to 6-aminocaproic acid, the evidence for AKI specifically related to this drug exposure as reported in the drug label is not detailed. Further investigation into clinical trials, case studies, and additional post-marketing reports could potentially provide more insight into this relationship.

To find more information, an in-depth literature search would be required, including reviews of case studies and clinical trial databases for cases where AKI was specifically reported in association with 6-aminocaproic acid use.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, I do not have access to real-time databases or resources that would allow me to provide any new evidence or updated information about this relationship that may have emerged after this time. It is recommended that clinicians and researchers consult the latest medical literature and drug safety databases for the most current information.","Based on the provided drug label sections for 6-aminocaproic acid, acute kidney injury is listed as ""BUN increased, renal failure"" under the ""Urogenital"" adverse reactions category. This indicates that there is a recognized potential for kidney-related adverse effects, including acute kidney injury, associated with the drug. In this specific case, refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and 6-aminocaproic acid would not be accurate because the drug label explicitly mentions renal failure as a possible adverse reaction.

As such, the evidence to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and 6-aminocaproic acid is not available in the provided drug label sections. On the contrary, the label acknowledges renal failure—an umbrella term that includes acute kidney injury—as an adverse event that has been reported with the use of this medication.

Therefore, the response to the request for evidence refuting the relationship is ""NA"" as the adverse reaction in question is indeed related to the drug according to the drug label information. 

Sources:
- The provided sections of the drug label for 6-aminocaproic acid."
acute kidney injury,abacavir,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trial experiences and postmarketing surveillance, acute kidney injury is not listed as a commonly reported adverse reaction to abacavir. There are no specific mentions of acute kidney injury in the adverse reactions (Section 6.1 and 6.2), warnings, or boxed warnings sections of the abacavir drug label. However, renal failure is mentioned in the context of hypersensitivity reactions, which are a known severe adverse reaction that can occur with abacavir (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects). In the description, renal failure is listed as one of the potential consequences of a hypersensitivity reaction, along with other organ failures and serious symptoms.

Overall, there is no clear and direct evidence provided in the drug label to suggest that acute kidney injury is a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to abacavir. To confirm this association, more focused research such as dedicated observational studies or case reports specifically analyzing the occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients taking abacavir would be needed. As of the information available, acute kidney injury should not be considered a typical adverse reaction to abacavir unless future studies or clinical reports provide further evidence to establish this relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,abatacept,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for abatacept (ORENCIA), evidence regarding acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to abatacept comes from post-marketing surveillance and clinical trials.

Acute kidney injury is explicitly listed as one of the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) in the prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [Section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. This adverse reaction was reported in clinical trials when abatacept was used alongside a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate for aGVHD prophylaxis. Consequently, acute kidney injury appears to have a known association with abatacept administration in this specific patient population.

Furthermore, the data from clinical studies (GVHD-1) providing additional support are presented in a summarized form in Table 5. This table lists the adverse reactions in patients with aGVHD who received ORENCIA, with acute kidney injury reported in 9% of patients in the 7 of 8 HLA-matched cohort (n=43) and in 15% in the 8 of 8 HLA-matched cohort (n=73). These rates were significantly elevated compared to the placebo control [Table 5].

Outside these patient groups, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as a common adverse effect in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) treated with abatacept in the sections provided.

The evidence does not detail the incidence of acute kidney injury outside of the context of aGVHD prophylaxis following HSCT. Therefore, acute kidney injury as an adverse effect appears related to abatacept within a particular clinical context of HSCT and aGVHD prophylaxis but may not be a broadly observed adverse reaction among patients using abatacept for other indications such as RA, PsA, or pJIA based on the provided label information. 

However, postmarketing experience is also mentioned in the label in section 6.3 [Postmarketing Experience]. While no specific incidence or details are provided for acute kidney injury, this section of the drug label acknowledges that adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and therefore the frequency or establishment of a causal relationship to ORENCIA may not always be reliably estimated.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and abatacept use in patients undergoing unrelated HSCT for aGVHD prophylaxis, but this adverse reaction is not highlighted as common or well-established in other populations treated with abatacept based on the current information.",NA
acute kidney injury,abemaciclib,,"The provided drug label for abemaciclib (trade name VERZENIO) includes extensive information about the safety profile of the drug based on clinical trials and postmarketing experience. However, there is no direct mention in the label of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction related to abemaciclib use. AKI is a condition characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the blood and an inability of the kidneys to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.

The adverse reactions included in the label that may have relevance to kidney function include laboratory findings of increased creatinine levels, which were frequently observed in patients treated with abemaciclib. It is known that abemaciclimb causes increased serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal tubular secretion transporters without affecting glomerular function. This would suggest a non-injurious effect on the kidneys themselves. However, clinically evident AKI, rather than asymptomatic increases in creatinine, is a more serious condition usually associated with more extensive damage to the kidney's filtering capacity or a severe decrease in kidney blood flow.

In the MONARCH 2 trial, an adverse reaction leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant was acute kidney injury (0.2%), indicating that there were some instances of AKI in patients receiving abemaciclib in the context of an extensive clinical trial cohort. However, the specific details regarding these cases, such as the evidence of causation and the clinical course of these patients, are not included in the label.

Given the limited information provided, it appears there is at least a potential signal for AKI as an adverse reaction associated with abemaciclib, as evidenced by the rare necessity for treatment discontinuation due to AKI in clinical trials. Nonetheless, the overall incidence appears to be quite low, and there may be additional patient-specific or disease-specific factors contributing to this outcome.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting a relationship between AKI and abemaciclib use is limited but does suggest that a low incidence of AKI may occur. Healthcare providers should be aware of this potential risk, monitor kidney function as recommended in patients taking abemaciclib, and consider alternative markers of kidney function given the drug's effects on creatinine levels. Close observation may be particularly warranted in patients with existing risk factors for AKI.","Based on the provided drug label sections for abemaciclib (VERZENIO), there is no mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials or postmarketing experience sections. The adverse reactions sections detail the most common and severe effects observed, including diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. AKI is not listed among them.

The laboratory abnormalities observed in patients receiving abemaciclib frequently include increased serum creatinine levels; however, this is attributed to inhibition of renal tubular secretion transporters without affecting glomerular function. This means that while abemaciclib can cause increased serum creatinine, which is a marker that could suggest kidney issues, it does not actually impair glomerular function – the kidney's filtration ability. The label advises that alternative markers such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cystatin C, or calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be considered to determine if actual renal function is impaired.

The warnings and precautions do indicate one instance of permanent discontinuation of abemaciclib due to acute kidney injury, but given the context, it does not establish this as a common adverse reaction or a direct relationship with abemaciclib.

In summary, the evidence does not suggest that AKI is a common or established adverse reaction related to abemaciclib. The single mention of an instance of AKI leading to discontinuation among large-scale clinical trials and extensive postmarketing surveillance does not support a significant relationship. Therefore, based on available evidence in the provided document, acute kidney injury is not an adverse reaction associated with the administration of abemaciclib, except in a rare, singular incident."
acute kidney injury,acamprosate,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and acamprosate exposure primarily comes from postmarketing surveillance, as indicated in section 6.2 of the drug label. It is specifically noted that acute kidney failure has been reported to be temporally associated with acamprosate calcium treatment in at least three patients. This indicates that after the drug's approval, during its use in the general population, there were a minimum of three reported instances where patients developed acute kidney injury in a timing that suggested a possible link to acamprosate use.

However, the exact frequency of this adverse reaction and the establishment of a causal relationship are challenging due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reports and the uncertainty of the size of the exposed population. Section 5.1 of the labeling also points users to a necessary dose reduction requirement for patients with moderate renal impairment and contraindication in severe renal impairment, which highlights that the drug can have renal-related risks.

Clinical trials experience (section 6.1) does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury as a common adverse event. The trials included over 7000 patients, with no direct correlation reported between typical dosing and acute kidney injury within the clinical trial settings. Adverse events causing discontinuation in clinical trials were mostly diarrhea, with no mention of kidney-related issues leading to stopping the drug.

In the warnings and precautions section (5), there is an acknowledgment that suicidality and depression are clinically significant serious adverse reactions associated with acamprosate, with explicit mention of acute kidney failure as well. This reinforces the acknowledgement that while not common, acute kidney failure is indeed a recognized risk of acamprosate use.

Therefore, the evidence of a potential relationship between acute kidney injury and acamprosate exposure is not robust and mainly consists of case reports from postmarketing data. Further studies, such as more comprehensive observational studies or pharmacovigilance data analysis, would be required to accurately quantify this risk and establish a more definitive causal connection.",NA
acute kidney injury,acetazolamide,,"Summary of Evidence:

Clinical Trials:
Evidence supporting the association between acetazolamide and acute kidney injury (AKI) may not be extensively documented in the adverse reaction section from the provided drug label. Clinical trial data may not directly cite AKI as a common adverse reaction but closely related issues such as electrolyte imbalance and metabolic acidosis, which can contribute to renal impairment, are mentioned.

Case Studies:
Case studies might provide individual or rare instances where acetazolamide exposure led to AKI. Such reports would typically detail the patient's history, the dose and duration of acetazolamide therapy, and the clinical course of the kidney injury, including any laboratory findings such as elevated creatinine or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
In post-marketing surveillance, which tracks adverse events after a drug has been approved and is in widespread use, instances of AKI may have been reported. These reports are an important source as they can identify rare or long-term side effects not seen in clinical trials. However, the precise relationship can be harder to establish due to confounding factors in the post-marketing setting. 

The urogenital section of the adverse reactions in the drug label mentions ""renal failure"" without specifying whether it refers to acute or chronic kidney injuries. This may include AKI as part of broader renal adverse events. Crystalluria and an increased risk of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) with long-term therapy are reported, which can lead to AKI.

Conclusion & Sources:
The evidence connecting acetazolamide and AKI comes from the drug label, which lists renal failure as a possible adverse event. However, AKI is not explicitly detailed among the common reactions. Further investigation into case reports and post-marketing surveillance may yield more specific evidence. In general, to establish a definitive correlation, it would be necessary to review case studies, clinical trial data, and reports from post-marketing surveillance that elucidate the incidence and causative relationship between acetazolamide use and acute kidney injury. If such detailed data is lacking, it would be important to make this clear and rely on the general knowledge of the drug's pharmacological effects and related renal adverse outcomes.

In practice, due diligence is necessary to review scientific databases, pharmacovigilance records, and the latest research literature to provide the most current and comprehensive summary of evidence for a drug-adverse reaction relationship.","NA

The drug label for acetazolamide does list renal failure as a potential adverse reaction under the 'Urogenital' section, indicating a recognized relationship between drug exposure and kidney-related issues. Acute kidney injury falls within the spectrum of renal failure; hence, evidence specifically refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and acetazolamide is not provided in the label information provided."
acute kidney injury,acyclovir,1.0,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been identified as a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of acyclovir. The evidence supporting this relationship comes primarily from post-marketing surveillance since the clinical trials cited in the drug label primarily report gastrointestinal and general symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, malaise, and headache as the most frequent adverse reactions. AKI is not listed among the most common adverse reactions in these trials.

Detailed evaluation of the drug label reveals that AKI is mentioned under the ""Observed During Clinical Practice"" section. This indicates that after acyclovir was approved and began being used in the broader population, healthcare professionals reported occurrences of renal failure and elevated creatinine, which are markers of AKI. These reports come from the post-marketing experience, where voluntary reporting by healthcare professionals and patients is done when they suspect a connection between the treatment and the adverse reaction. However, because this surveillance data is voluntarily reported and comes from a population of unknown size, the exact frequency and causality cannot be definitely established.

Furthermore, under the “Urogenital” subsection, it is specified that renal failure and renal pain may be associated with renal failure, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are noted, all of which are related to kidney function. It also advises caution in older adults or patients with renal impairment, suggesting that this population may be at a higher risk for neurological symptoms that may be marked in the context of renal impairment.

Post-marketing reports are valuable for identifying rare or long-term adverse reactions that may not be detected in clinical trials. Still, they do not provide the same level of evidence as randomized controlled trials due to the lack of a control group, possible underreporting, and the absence of a confirmed causal relationship.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not a frequently reported adverse reaction in acyclovir clinical trials, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance that suggests a potential association with acyclovir use. However, a causal relationship cannot be definitively established based on this information alone due to the limitations of post-marketing data. Health care professionals should monitor renal function when prescribing acyclovir, especially in patients at higher risk for kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,adagrasib,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to adagrasib exposure. This evidence is derived from clinical trials experience, specifically from patients undergoing treatment with adagrasib in KRYSTAL-1:

1. **Clinical Trials Evidence:**
   - In the KRYSTAL-1 trial, which evaluated the safety of adagrasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal impairment was reported as one of the most common adverse reactions.
   - Among the reported adverse reactions, renal impairment occurred in 36% of patients, with 6% experiencing Grade 3 or 4 reactions. Renal impairment, as reported here, includes acute kidney injury and increased blood creatinine levels (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience).
   - Serious adverse reactions reported in the KRYSTAL-1 trial included renal impairment in 8% of patients who received adagrasib (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience).
   - The trial also indicates that dose interruptions, reductions, or permanent discontinuation of adagrasib include renal impairment as one of the reasons for these actions.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
   - No specific mention of post-marketing surveillance data related to acute kidney injury and adagrasib exposure is provided within the information given.

3. **Case Studies:**
   - The information provided does not include specific case studies outside of the clinical trial setting.

Given this information from the clinical trials, renal impairment, including acute kidney injury, is a documented adverse reaction associated with adagrasib treatment. It's important to monitor patients for renal function changes as mentioned in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions).

Physicians should watch for signs and symptoms of kidney injury during treatment with adagrasib and manage using appropriate supportive care if needed. The safety profile of adagrasib from clinical trials indicates that AKI is a significant potential adverse reaction that requires careful monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustments or discontinuation depending on severity.",NA
acute kidney injury,adefovir,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and drug exposure to adefovir dipivoxil is derived from clinical trials data, post-marketing surveillance, and its inclusion within official labeling documents, which highlight nephrotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction.

1. Clinical Trials:
Clinical trial data presented in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the drug label provide an indication that adefovir dipivoxil can lead to nephrotoxicity. In the studies (437 and 438), no patients developed a confirmed serum creatinine increase ≥0.5 mg/dL from baseline by Week 48; however, by Week 96, approximately 2% did present with such an increase. Further data from extended treatment in Study 438 indicate that 3% of patients (4 of 125) experienced a confirmed increase of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline in serum creatinine. Additionally, in pre- and post-liver transplantation patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil, increases in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline occurred in a significant percentage of patients within 48 and 96 weeks.

2. Special Risk Patients:
Patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or other risk factors for renal impairment were observed to experience changes in renal function with treatment. This includes a population of pre- and post-liver transplantation patients, in whom the nephrotoxicity could not be solely attributed to adefovir dipivoxil due to concomitant risk factors. Nevertheless, 19 of 467 patients discontinued treatment due to renal adverse events.

3. Pediatric Patients:
In pediatric studies, although no acute kidney injury was reported up to Week 48, the need for caution and monitoring is advised, especially in adolescents with underlying renal dysfunction.

4. Post-Marketing Surveillance (section 6.4):
The post-marketing experience has expanded the profile of adverse reactions to include potentially severe renal and urinary disorders such as renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, which are indicative of significant renal injury. While the incidence rates cannot be precisely determined, this real-world data contributes to the body of evidence identifying renal toxicity as a consequence of adefovir exposure.

5. Warnings and Precautions (section 5.2):
The drug label contains strong warnings regarding nephrotoxicity risk associated with the chronic administration of adefovir dipivoxil. It states that the drug can cause gradual increases in serum creatinine and decreases in serum phosphorus, signaling a risk for renal impairment. Mention of ""delayed nephrotoxicity"" also suggests an awareness of renal adverse effects that may develop over time with continued adefovir use.

In summary, the evidence linking adefovir dipivoxil exposure to potential acute kidney injury is substantiated by clinical trial data, documented adverse reactions in specific patient populations, and cases reported through post-marketing surveillance. These collectively support that there is a relationship between adefovir dipivoxil and an increased risk of nephrotoxicity, contributing to adverse renal outcomes such as AKI in certain patients.",NA
acute kidney injury,afatinib,,"The provided drug label sections contain detailed information about the clinical trials, adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience associated with the use of afatinib (GILOTRIF). However, regarding the specific relationship between afatinib and acute kidney injury, the label does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction.

From the clinical trials experience (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 8), common adverse reactions include gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and infections. Serious adverse reactions reported include diarrhea, vomiting, dyspnea, fatigue, and hypokalemia. Additionally, the drug has known risk factors leading to renal impairment secondary to severe diarrhea. Acute renal failure is mentioned as a fatal adverse reaction in post-marketing experience, but there is no specificity whether it is classified under acute kidney injury or another form of renal impairment.

The warnings and precautions section addresses the risk of renal failure due to severe, prolonged diarrhea not responsive to anti-diarrheal agents, which suggests a potential indirect relationship between afatinib exposure and kidney-related adverse effects. This renal impairment could manifest as acute kidney injury, but the label does not provide direct evidence for this terminology.

Therefore, while there is no direct evidence from the label that acute kidney injury is recognized as a specific adverse reaction to afatinibe, there is an indication of renal impairment associated with severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions like diarrhea which may lead to dehydration and subsequent kidney injury. Health care providers should monitor kidney function in patients receiving afatinib, especially in the context of severe diarrhea. It would be prudent to review additional pharmacovigilance data and published literature to determine if there is more targeted evidence relating afatinib to acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,afatinib,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions in the provided sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) of the drug label for afatinib (brand name GILOTRIF). However, related information presented indicates that diarrhea is a commonly observed adverse reaction (96% of patients in LUX-Lung 3 trial), and among those patients, renal impairment as a consequence of diarrhea occurred in 6%, with 1.3% being Grade 3. Additionally, acute renal failure is mentioned as a fatal adverse reaction in 0.3% of GILOTRIF-treated patients in the LUX-Lung 8 trial.

While AKI is not specifically identified as a common adverse reaction in the summaries of LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 8 clinical trials or in the postmarketing experience, its potential association with afatinib can be inferred from the incidents of renal impairment secondary to severe diarrhea and the single mention of fatal acute renal failure. Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which if severe and prolonged, can contribute to AKI. Therefore, while AKI is not directly cited as an adverse reaction to afatinib, the drug's association with severe diarrhea presents a plausible indirect pathway for renal impairment, including AKI.

Considering these findings, healthcare providers should monitor renal function in patients receiving afatinib, especially if severe diarrhea occurs. Patients should also be instructed on the importance of hydration and possibly provided with anti-diarrheal agents to mitigate the risk of dehydration that could lead to renal-related issues.

To summarize, evidence for a direct relationship between afatinib exposure and AKI is not explicit in the provided label information. The evidence for an indirect relationship through severe diarrhea leading to renal impairment, including potential AKI, is based on clinical trial data (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 8) and post-marketing surveillance.

acute kidney injury,agalsidase beta,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance for agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) according to the provided drug label sections. The ""increased blood creatinine"" is noted under adverse reactions in Table 2 of the clinical trials section (6.1), with a reported 5% occurrence in patients treated with Fabrazyme versus 0% in the placebo group. Increased blood creatinine levels are indicative of impaired kidney function, which could potentially suggest a relationship to AKI; however, AKI as an explicit condition is not mentioned.

Furthermore, under postmarketing experience (section 6.3), ""renal failure"" is listed without specific frequency or establishing a direct causal relationship to drug exposure. Renal failure could encompass acute kidney injury, but the label text does not provide sufficient detail to establish a solid connection.

In the warnings and precautions (section 5), there are no explicit statements about AKI being a known complication of treatment with agalsidase beta.

Therefore, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is a potential signal regarding kidney-related adverse effects based on the notation of increased blood creatinine and renal failure. However, these references lack direct and explicit evidence to conclusively demonstrate that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction to agalsidase beta. Additional information from studies that directly investigate renal function in patients treated with agalsidase beta would be needed to clearly establish such a relationship.

For individuals monitoring kidney function while on agalsidase beta, any signs of deteriorating kidney function such as increased serum creatinine or decreased glomerular filtration rate should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine if AKI or other forms of kidney injury may be related to the treatment.",NA
acute kidney injury,albendazole,,"After analyzing the provided drug label sections for Albendazole, acute kidney injury (AKI) is mentioned as an adverse reaction identified during post-marketing surveillance of the drug. However, the label does not provide specific details regarding the incidence rate or the certainty of the causal relationship between Alboldenazole and AKI, as this information is often difficult to ascertain from voluntary reports.

The section ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" states that acute renal failure, a term commonly equated with acute kidney injury, has been reported as an adverse reaction after the approval of Albendazole. Due to the nature of post-marketing surveillance, these reports are given by healthcare professionals or consumers, and while they are valuable for identifying potential new adverse reactions, they do not provide the level of detail typically found in controlled clinical trials to establish a causal relationship firmly.

Clinical trials mentioned in section ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" and the listed adverse reactions do not explicitly mention acute kidney injury as an observed outcome. Adverse reactions in the clinical trials focused primarily on gastrointestinal, hepatic, blood, immune system, nervous system, and skin or subcutaneous disorders, with the most common being raised liver enzyme levels and gastrointestinal symptoms.

In summary, while acute kidney injury has been reported as an adverse effect in the post-marketing experience of Albendazole, the available drug label information does not offer detailed evidence from clinical trials or case studies to conclusively determine the frequency or causal relationship of AKI to Albendazole. It's important to consider that post-marketing reports can suggest an association but are not sufficient to establish causation due to the spontaneous and voluntary nature of the reporting system. Additional studies or case reports beyond the scope of the drug label would be necessary to support a clear relationship between Albendazole and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,aldesleukin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of aldesleukin (brand name Proleukin) is supported by evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

### Clinical Trials Evidence:
As cited in the provided drug label, severe renal toxicity, including oliguria and renal failure, can occur with aldesleukin administration. Oliguria is a condition where the kidneys produce less urine, often leading to AKI, and it was experienced by 36% of patients in the clinical trials. An increase in blood creatinine, a marker of renal function, was observed in 33% of the patients (section 6.1). Furthermore, among the life-threatening adverse reactions (Grade 4) reported by less than 1% of the 525 patients, acute kidney injury and renal failure were listed (section 6.1). These details come from controlled studies enrolling a total of 525 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma.

### Post-Marketing Experience:
Postmarketing observations, which stem from voluntary reports and may not have defined incidence rates, also indicate renal toxicity as an adverse reaction. Specific renal-related adverse events reported include renal failure and renal tubular necrosis (section 6.2), both of which can either be components of AKI or result from it.

### Warnings on the Drug Label:
The drug label contains a specific warning regarding renal toxicity, urging for the monitoring of renal function at baseline and throughout treatment, and indicating that Proleukin should be withheld or discontinued based on the severity of renal impairment (sections 5 and 5.4).

### Summary:
The relationship between aldesleukin and acute kidney injury is well-documented through clinical trial results, with a significant proportion of patients experiencing adverse events related to renal function such as oliguria and increased creatinine levels. Additionally, the potential for severe renal toxicity is acknowledged in the warnings and precautions sections of the drug label, and post-marketing experiences reinforce this association. These findings indicate that acute kidney injury is indeed a possible adverse reaction of aldesleukin, necessitating careful monitoring and management of renal function in patients receiving the drug.",NA
acute kidney injury,alectinib,,"Based on the provided label information for alectinib (ALECENSA), there is evidence supporting the relationship between drug exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury. Specifically, this is drawn from clinical trial data as follows:

- In the ALEX study of ALECENSA, which included 152 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, serious adverse reactions were reported in 28% of patients treated with ALECENSA. Among these, renal impairment was reported in 3.9%, which included those with increased blood creatinine and decreased creatinine renal clearance (Section 6.1). Furthermore, it was mentioned that renal impairment, which includes acute kidney injury, was reported as a Grade 3-4 adverse event in 12 of the patients (3.9%) and included two Grade 5 events (fatal outcomes) (Section 6.1, Table 3). 

- Renal impairment was reported in 8% of patients in studies NP28761, NP28673, and ALEX combined, with Grade ≥3 renal impairment occurring in 1.7% and fatal events constituting 0.5%. The requirement for dose modifications for renal impairment occurred in 3.2% of patients (Section 5.3).

From these clinical trials, it's evidenced that alectinib has been associated with instances of severe renal impairment, including acute kidney injury, which in some cases led to fatal outcomes.

Additionally, according to post-marketing experience, acute kidney injury has been listed as a follow-up point under the ""renal impairment"" section (Section 6 Postmarketing Experience), indicating that reports of acute kidney injury have been noted during the broader usage of the drug after approval. This serves as an additional evidence source apart from controlled clinical trial settings and enhances the understanding that acute kidney injury can occur with alectinib usage.

Clinicians are advised to monitor renal function as described in the warnings, withholding doses for severe renal impairment, and resuming at reduced doses or permanently discontinuing alectinib if necessary (Section 5.3).

In conclusion, both clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance suggest a relationship between alectinib and acute kidney injury, warranting careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments.",NA
acute kidney injury,alfuzosin,,"Based on the provided drug label information for alfuzosin, there is no explicitly stated evidence linking alfuzosin to acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in the described clinical trial experiences (Section 6.1), postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), or the warnings and precautions sections. The clinical trials mentioned in the drug label focused on common adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of ≥2% and at a higher incidence than placebo, which included dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and fatigue. Additionally, other adverse reactions such as orthostatic effects (e.g., hypotension, syncope) and various system-specific events (e.g., gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatobiliary, cardiovascular) are noted, none of which pertain to acute kidney injury.

Postmarketing experiences noted in the drug label encompass a range of disorders, with certain hepatic disorders being reported, but acute kidney injury is not specifically mentioned.

Warnings and precautions do mention that caution should be taken in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), suggesting potential issues with kidney function, however, the text does not directly associate alfuzosin with the induction of acute kidney injury.

In summary, based on the presented sections of the alfuzosin drug label, there is no direct evidence supporting a relationship between alfuzosin use and acute kidney injury. Monitoring of patients with existing renal impairment is advised, which may hint at possible risks related to kidney function but does not confirm acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction of this drug. Further investigation into scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and case reports would be required to ascertain if any additional evidence exists beyond the provided drug label.",NA
acute kidney injury,allogeneic processed thymus tissue,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for RETHYMIC, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure. This evidence comes from clinical trials as part of post-marketing surveillance.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
According to the safety data derived from 10 prospective, single-center, open-label studies, which included follow-up of at least one year for 105 patients treated with RETHYMIC, renal impairment/failure, which includes renal failure and acute kidney injury (AKI), proteinuria, and increased blood creatinine, was reported as an adverse reaction in approximately 12% (13 out of 105) patients. It is important to note that ""renal impairment / failure"" as used in the drug label encapsulates a spectrum of renal conditions, including acute kidney injury as specified.

Warnings and Precautions:
In section 5.4 of the drug label, there is mention of pre-existing renal impairment as a risk factor for death following treatment with RETHYMIC. Ten patients with renal impairment at baseline were treated with RETHYMIC, and of these, six died (including one who died 3 years after treatment). While this does not specifically address post-treatment AKI, it indicates that kidney function is an important consideration both before and after treatment with RETHYMIC, suggesting renal-related adverse events including acute kidney injury are significant concerns.

Other Relevant Information:
The drug label also includes general information on the monitoring of certain parameters such as serum creatinine and urinalysis, which are important in diagnosing and managing AKI. Continuous monitoring and treatment are recommended for patients at risk for developing renal impairment or failure.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials suggests that acute kidney injury is indeed a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of RETHYMIC, with approximately 12% of patients experiencing renal impairment or failure. Additionally, precautionary notes in the drug label highlight the risk associated with pre-existing renal impairment and the importance of renal function monitoring. These findings were derived from the aggregate analysis of clinical trials, which represent a controlled setting, indicating a need for ongoing surveillance in wider clinical practice.","NA

The drug label for RETHYMIC provided, explicitly mentions renal impairment/failure – which encompasses acute kidney injury – as a common adverse reaction occurring in at least 12% of patients treated in clinical studies. The label includes renal impairment/failure (including acute kidney injury) in the list of adverse reactions observed. Hence, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to RETHYMIC as the drug's clinical trials data support this association."
acute kidney injury,allopurinol,1.0,"Evidence for the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and allopurinol is inferred from several sources mentioned in the drug label. These sources include clinical trials, post-marketing reports, and specific warnings listed on the labeling:

1. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:** The drug label indicates that adverse reactions associated with allopurinol, such as renal failure and nephritis, have been identified in post-marketing reports. However, the exact frequency of these events is not easily estimated because they were reported voluntarily from an uncertain population size. This makes it difficult to establish a definitive causal relationship between drug exposure and AKI.

2. **Clinical Warnings and Precautions (5.3 Nephrotoxicity):** Allopurinol may affect kidney function, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or a history of kidney stones. The label warns that these patients may be at an increased risk for worsening of kidney function or AKI. While this section primarily discusses the risk of xanthine calculi formation as a possible mechanism for AKK, it underscores the importance of kidney monitoring during allopurinol therapy.

3. **Urogenital Adverse Reactions:** Under the section detailing less common adverse reactions (<1%), renal failure is noted. Acute kidney injury may present as an acute decline in renal function, potentially leading to renal failure, which is listed here as a possible adverse reaction to allopurinol.

4. **Dosage and Administration Recommendations:** The label suggests monitoring kidney function frequently during the early stages of administration in patients taking allopurinol for the management of gout or recurrent calcium oxalate calculi, indicating awareness of potential renal complications.

5. **Specific Populations at Risk:** The label notes that maintaining adequate hydration is important to prevent renal precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents, highlighting the potential risk of AKI associated with allopurinol under certain circumstances.

In conclusion, while no specific clinical trial data are provided in the sections referenced, the labeling for allopurinol contains warnings about nephrotoxicity, including acute kidney injury, and precautions regarding renal function monitoring. Post-marketing surveillance data also suggest an association, but causality and frequency are less clear due to the nature of voluntary reporting. The drug label itself serves as a source, indicating recognition by regulatory authorities and the manufacturer of the potential risk of AKI with allopurinol use.",NA
acute kidney injury,alogliptin,,"Evidence from the provided drug label sections indicates that there is an association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to alogliptin, which is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

In the clinical trials described under ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience,"" renal function adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with alogliptin. Specifically, 3.4% of patients on alogliptin experienced renal function adverse reactions, compared to 1.3% of patients on placebo. Adverse reactions included renal impairment (0.5% alogliptin vs. 0.1% placebo), decreased creatinine clearance (1.6% alogliptin vs. 0.5% placebo), and increased blood creatinine (0.5% alogliptin vs. 0.3% placebo). The EXAMINE trial, involving high cardiovascular risk patients with type 2 diabetes, showed renal impairment reactions in 23% of alogliptin-treated patients versus 21% receiving placebo. Laboratory measures indicated a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25% or more in 21.1% of alogliptin patients versus 18.7% on placebo.

Additionally, under ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience,"" there's mention of tubulointerstitial nephritis among the adverse reactions identified during the post-marketing use of alogliptin, although the exact frequency or a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure cannot be reliably estimated due to the nature of voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size.

In terms of evaluating evidence:

- The clinical trial data provide a direct comparison between alogliptin and placebo groups, indicating a numerical increase in adverse renal effects among patients receiving alogliptin.
- The observational data from post-marketing surveillance functions as a real-world evidence complementing clinical trial findings, albeit with the inherent limitations in causality and frequency assessment due to voluntary reporting.
- It is important to note that worsening of chronic kidney disease stage was observed in a subset of patients within the EXAMINE trial, suggesting that alogliptin could exacerbate pre-existing renal conditions.

Overall, these findings suggest a potential relationship between alogliptin exposure and the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening renal function, with evidence drawn from controlled clinical trials and supported by post-marketing experience. However, as the drug label indicates, the evidence does not suffice to draw definitive cause-and-effect conclusions, and healthcare providers should monitor renal function in patients taking alogliptin as recommended under ""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"".","NA

The provided label sections, including warnings and adverse reactions, do not present evidence refuting the relationship between a potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury and drug exposure to alogliptin. Acute kidney injury is not listed among the common adverse reactions or specifically refuted as an adverse reaction in the labeling information. However, renal impairment is acknowledged as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials and postmarketing experience sections, which suggests a possible relationship between alogliptin and adverse renal effects rather than refuting it. Therefore, the summary conclusion is 'NA' since there is no available evidence within the provided sections that refutes acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction of alogliptin."
acute kidney injury,alogliptin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for alogliptin (NESINA), there is evidence supporting a relationship between alogliptin exposure and acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The clinical trials mentioned in Section 6.1 of the drug label indicate that in controlled clinical trials, renal-related adverse reactions occurred more frequently in patients treated with alogliptin compared with placebo and active comparator. Specifically, 3.4% of patients treated with alogliptin experienced renal function adverse reactions compared to 1.3% with placebo. Reported reactions included renal impairment, decreased creatinine clearance, and increased blood creatinine. In the EXAMINE trial, renal impairment was more commonly reported with alogliptin use than with placebo (7.7% vs. 6.7%).

Post-marketing Experience:
Section 6.2 of the label details postmarketing experiences, identifying tubulointerstitial nephritis among the renal and urinary disorders associated with the postmarketing use of alogliptin. However, the frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure cannot be reliably estimated due to the nature of voluntary reporting in a postmarketing setting.

Warnings and Precautions:
Section 5 does not specifically mention AKI, but details are provided on renal impairment observed in clinical trials and advises monitoring of renal function in relation to the drug use.

In summary, evidence from clinical trial data and postmarketing reports suggests that there is an association between alogliptin use and the development of acute kidney injury or renal impairment. The precise frequency and causality are less clear due to the inherent limitations of voluntary postmarketing reporting. Clinicians should be vigilant for signs of renal dysfunction in patients taking alogliptin and manage as per existing guidelines, including potential drug discontinuation and treatment of AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,alpelisib,,"In the clinical trial experience detailed in the drug label for alpelisib (PIQRAY), acute kidney injury is documented as a serious adverse reaction. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SOLAR-1 trial, which evaluated the safety of PIQRAY in combination with fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced, or metastatic breast cancer, acute kidney injury was observed as a serious adverse reaction in 2.5% of patients receiving PIQRAY plus fulvestrant.

This evidence is sourced directly from the clinical trial section (6.1 Clinical Trial Experience) of the drug label, indicating a clear relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure within this specific patient population and treatment regimen.

As for post-marketing experience, the drug label does not explicitly list acute kidney injury under section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience), which means either it was not reported post-marketing or not considered frequent or severe enough to be listed separately. However, the label does mention severe diarrhea in most patients and colitis in post-marketing, both of which could potentially lead to dehydration and secondary acute kidney injury.

In terms of the warnings and precautions, section 5.5 outlines the risk of diarrhea or colitis, which could result in dehydration and subsequent acute kidney injury during treatment with PIQRAY. This suggests an indirect relationship where the drug-induced gastrointestinal adverse reactions could potentially lead to kidney injury if not properly managed.

In summary, there is evidence from a clinical trial (SOLAR-1) supporting the relationship between alpelisib and acute kidney injury, and an indirect link through dehydration secondary to severe diarrhea or colitis as mentioned in the drug label's warnings and precautions. This information is sourced directly from the specified sections of the alpelisib drug label.",NA
acute kidney injury,amifostine,,"The provided drug label sections outline adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience with the use of amifostine (brand name ETHYOL). Based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction specifically associated with amifostine in the context of clinical trial experiences or the post-marketing surveillance detailed.

However, under the section detailing post-marketing experience (6.2), renal failure is listed among the adverse reactions reported. While renal failure, which includes acute kidney injury, has been identified during post-approval use of ETHYOL, the drug label indicates that it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency of this reaction or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure due to the nature of voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size.

Furthermore, in the warnings and precautions section (5.3), there is a mention of renal failure in the context of severe hypotension events observed after ETHYOL administration. These events included a range of cardiovascular and respiratory incidents, including renal failure, without specifying whether it was acute or chronic in nature.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not explicitly stated as a known adverse reaction to amifostine in the clinical trial experience, post-marketing surveillance does list renal failure, which encompasses AKI, as a reported adverse event. However, due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports, there is a lack of specific data to reliably discern the frequency or definitively establish a direct causative link to the drug's administration. Caution should be exercised, and further investigation may be warranted if acute kidney injury is suspected in the context of amifostine exposure in clinical settings.","NA

The provided drug label sections for amifostine (brand name ETHYOL) do not mention acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction or in the context of post-marketing experience. Furthermore, there is no direct evidence discussed in the label refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and amifostine. Therefore, there is no available summary of evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to amifostine based on the provided sections of the drug label."
acute kidney injury,amikacin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of amikacin is derived from the drug label for ARIKAYCE, clinical trials, and the established nephrotoxicity profile of aminoglycosides, which includes amikacin.

The drug label for ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), references nephrotoxicity observed during clinical trials in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease but clarifies that it was not observed at a higher frequency than the background regimen alone (section 5.7). Nephrotoxicity, which encompasses AKI, is a known adverse reaction associated with aminoglycoside antibiotics, hence the need for close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction when prescribing ARIKAYCE.

No specific incidence rates for AKI are provided in the clinical trials cited in the sections 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience and 6.2 Postmarketing Experience for ARIKAYCE, nor is AKI directly listed as one of the reported adverse reactions.

While the drug label for ARIKAYCE does not provide direct or numerically quantified evidence of AKI, the warning included in section 5.7 suggests that practitioners should be aware of the aminoglycoside class effect of nephrotoxicity, which could include AKI.

Overall, the evidence for a direct relationship between AKI and amikacin is not explicitly detailed in the sections provided from the drug label. However, the established profile of aminoglycosides as nephrotoxic agents, which includes amikacin, along with the warnings in the drug label to closely monitor renal function, indicates that there is a recognized risk for AKI to occur due to amikacin exposure.",NA
acute kidney injury,amiodarone,,"Based on the detailed drug label information provided for amiodarone hydrochloride, there is an extensive list of potential adverse reactions associated with its use, ranging from thyroid abnormalities to pulmonary toxicity. However, within the sections provided (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, 6.2 Postmarketing Experience, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) directly related to amiodarone exposure either in the context of clinical trials, postmarketing experience, or listed as a warning or precaution. The warning and precaution sections do discuss the importance of monitoring for liver function abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, and other organ-specific toxicities, but renal impairment or AKI is not specifically included.

In the postmarketing experience section (6.2)., it is mentioned that renal impairment, renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure have been identified as adverse reactions during post-approval use of amiodarone hydrochloride, but no rate or causal relationship information is provided. Postmarketing surveillance can be subject to reporting biases and does not establish a causal relationship but does suggest that such events have been observed in patients taking amiodarone.

In summary, renal-related adverse events, including acute renal failure, are noted in the postmarketing experience of amiodarone hydrochloride, but the available data within the sections provided does not include detailed evidence to directly establish acute kidney injury as a defined adverse reaction linked to drug exposure. Further investigation into clinical studies, case reports, or additional surveillance data would be necessary to fully characterize the relationship between amiodarone and AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,anagrelide,,"Acute kidney injury has not been explicitly listed as an adverse reaction in either the clinical trials or post-marketing experience of anagrelide (sold under the brand name AGRYLIN), as outlined in the relevant sections provided. The adverse reactions that have been identified in clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance primarily relate to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and hematological effects along with other system-specific events.

In the clinical trials section (6.1), while several serious adverse reactions are reported in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, acute kidney injury is not mentioned. Adverse reactions reported in both adult and pediatric populations include cardiovascular disorders (like palpitations and tachycardia), gastrointestinal disorders (like diarrhea and nausea), and respiratory issues (like dyspnea and cough), among others. Renal and urinary disorders mentioned include hematuria and renal failure, but not acute kidney injury per se.

In postmarketing experience (6.2), while various reactions have been reported, the only renal and urinary disorder specified is tubulointerstitial nephritis. It's essential to note that tubulointerstitial nephritis can lead to renal impairment, which may potentially progress to acute kidney injury if severe or untreated; however, there is no direct link established in this information between anagrelide exposure and acute kidney injury as a defined adverse event.

Given the information provided, there is no clear and explicit evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction of anagrelide. Monitoring for renal function in patients taking anagrelide is prudent, especially in patients with risk factors for renal impairment or those displaying symptoms indicative of potential renal pathology. If new evidence arises or further pharmacovigilance data become available, the assessment of anagrelide's relationship with acute kidney injury may need to be revisited.",NA
acute kidney injury,apalutamide,,"Based on the provided drug label information for apalutamide (ERLEADA), there is evidence to suggest a relationship between apalutamide exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury (AKI). This evidence comes from the clinical trial data pertaining to the TITAN study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial conducted in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).

The drug label mentions that out of the patients treated with apalutamide, ten patients (1.9%) died from adverse reactions. Among these, acute kidney injury was the cause of death for two patients. While the absolute number of events is small, it does indicate that AKI was observed as a severe outcome in association with apalutamide use in this clinical trial setting.

It is important to note that the incidence of AKI leading to death is relatively rare (2 out of 524 patients treated with ERLEADA in the TITAN study), and it is not listed among the most common adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) that occurred more frequently in the ERLEADA-treated patients were fatigue, arthralgia, rash, decreased appetite, fall, weight decreased, hypertension, hot flush, diarrhea, and fracture.

Regarding post-marketing surveillance, the drug label does not specifically mention reports of AKI. This suggests that, as of the knowledge cutoff date, there has been no widespread reporting of AKI in the post-marketing setting that has been attributed to ERLEADA and confirmed by the FDA.

The relationship between ERLEADA and AKI, as evidenced by clinical trial data, should be considered when prescribing this medication. Healthcare providers are encouraged to monitor renal function as part of the overall clinical assessment and management of patients treated with apalutamide. It is also essential for healthcare professionals to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate surveillance systems to facilitate ongoing evaluation of drug safety profiles.

Please note that drug labels may update over time, and it is crucial to consult the latest product information, including pharmacovigilance data and post-marketing surveillance reports, for the most current assessment of drug-related adverse events.",NA
acute kidney injury,aprepitant,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for aprepitant, there is no direct evidence linking aprepitant to acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The safety of aprepitant was evaluated in 6,800 individuals. In clinical trials involving patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), common adverse reactions included fatigue, diarrhea, asthenia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and increased alanine aminotransferase, among others. Dehydration was mentioned, which, if severe, could potentially contribute to AKI, but AKI as an event was not directly listed as a commonly observed reaction in adult patients. Similarly, in pediatric patients, common reactions such as neutropenia, headache, and diarrhea were reported but AKI was not explicitly listed. Less common adverse reactions were also reported; however, these did not include any direct references to AKI.

Postmarketing Experience:
Postmarketing experience can sometimes provide additional insights into adverse reactions not captured during clinical trials. The label mentions several postmarketing adverse reactions, such as skin reactions (pruritus, rash, urticaria, including serious forms like Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis) and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. Neurotoxicity is mentioned in the context of concomitant use with ifosfamide. Nonetheless, there is no mention of AKI in the context of postmarketing surveillance.

Warnings and Precautions: 
In the section detailing warnings and precautions, interactions with CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors, effects on warfarin and hormonal contraception are discussed. However, there are no warnings related to AKI or renal function impairment.

In summary, the drug label for aprepitant does not provide evidence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction either through clinical trial data or postmarketing surveillance. AKI is not listed as a common, less common, or postmarketing adverse event in the provided label sections.

To reiterate, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to aprepitant based on the provided drug label sections. If you need more detailed or updated information, a thorough review of the most recent medical literature, clinical trial databases, and updated drug labels is recommended.",NA
acute kidney injury,arsenic trioxide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to arsenic trioxide. This association is supported by clinical trials and postmarketing experience data.

In the section summarizing clinical trial experience (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience), renal failure and renal impairment were reported as adverse reactions in patients treated with arsenic trioxide, with incidences of 8% each, and grade ≥3 adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients for renal failure. It is important to note that these observations were made in the context of a study involving patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

Additionally, the section detailing postmarketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), which encompasses adverse reactions identified after approval and during wider use of the medication, also lists renal impairment, although the frequency is not precisely quantified. Postmarketing surveillance contributes valuable real-world data regarding side effects that might not have been fully elucidated during clinical trials, due to limitations in sample size and controlled conditions.

It is crucial to monitor renal function when administering arsenic trioxide, given the potential for renal adverse effects, including acute kidney injury. The exact mechanism by which arsenic trioxide causes renal damage is not detailed in the provided sections. However, the emergence of renal-related adverse reactions both during controlled clinical trials and in broader clinical use provides evidence of a relationship between arsenic trioxide exposure and the risk of acute kidney injury.

For healthcare providers, it would be informative to consult the full prescribing information of arsenic trioxide, review the latest literature, and consider individual patient risk factors when evaluating the potential benefits and risks of treatment with arsenic trioxide, especially concerning renal health.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicates that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction related to arsenic trioxide use. Monitoring and mitigation strategies for renal complications should be implemented when patients are treated with this agent.",NA
acute kidney injury,asparaginase,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:

The clinical trial experience detailed in the drug label includes study JZP458-201, which evaluated RYLAZE (asparaginase) in patients receiving chemotherapy. In this study, 167 patients were exposed to RYLAZE, with a median of 4 courses administered. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 60% of the patients, among which acute kidney injury (AKI) was mentioned as a nonhematological serious adverse reaction occurring in at least 5% of the patients (no specific percentage for AKI provided).

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:

The drug label does not provide specific numbers or detailed descriptions of acute kidney injury from case studies or post-marketing surveillance data. However, given that AKI is included in the list of serious adverse reactions observed during the clinical trial, it can be inferred that cases of AKI have been identified following the administration of RYLAZE during the trial period.

Therefore, based on the clinical trial referenced in the drug label, there is evidence to support that acute kidney injury can be an adverse reaction of asparaginase (RYLAZE). The exact incidence rate specifically for AKI is not detailed, but it is acknowledged as an adverse reaction that occurred during the study period among patients treated with RYLAZE.

Source of Evidence:

The provided summary is based on the information from the drug label for RYLAZE, specifically the ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section and the ""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" section, which include data from the clinical trial JZP458-201. No additional sources were provided or referenced for this summary.",NA
acute kidney injury,aspirin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and aspirin exposure can be derived from various sources, including drug labels, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance.

The drug label for aspirin (e.g., DURLAZA) is a viable source of adverse reaction information. In the label's Section 6 ""ADVERSE REACTIONS,"" it lists renal-related adverse reactions reported in the literature for products containing low-dose aspirin. These reactions include:

- Interstitial nephritis
- Papillary necrosis
- Proteinuria
- Renal insufficiency and failure

These reactions indicate kidney-related adverse effects, and while they do not specifically label it as ""acute kidney injury,"" the terms ""renal insufficiency"" and ""renal failure"" can encompass AKI.

Additionally, the ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" section does not provide information directly linking aspirin use to acute kidney injury. However, it highlights an increased risk of bleeding which can, in certain circumstances, lead indirectly to kidney damage, especially if there is an associated shock or severe blood loss.

Clinical trials and literature, as referenced in the adverse reactions section of the label, have also reported kidney-related adverse effects. Identical adverse effects are listed in the label's ""Clinical Trials Experience"" showing consistency in findings although they do not directly address acute kidney injury in this context. 

To summarize, while the drug label for aspirin lists several kidney-related adverse reactions, the term ""acute kidney injury"" is not specifically mentioned. However, ""renal insufficiency"" and ""renal failure"" are included, which may encompass AKI. The clinical trials cited in the drug label also support the relationship between aspirin use and adverse renal outcomes.

Bear in mind that while this information provides evidence of a possible association, establishing a definitive causal relationship between aspirin and acute kidney injury requires more detailed evidence such as population-based studies, randomized controlled trials with renal endpoints, and robust post-marketing surveillance data that isolate kidney injury outcomes.

It is important to critically evaluate all evidence, considering the quality, sample size, and specificity of the reports when making causal inferences. Additional sources, such as large-scale observational studies or meta-analyses, may offer more comprehensive evaluations of this potential adverse reaction. As of the information provided, no further details on such studies are included. If there are other databases, publications, or surveillance systems with relevant data, they would need to be reviewed to support a more conclusive statement on the relationship between aspirin and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,atenolol,,"Based on the provided drug label information for atenolol, acute kidney injury is not listed as a common or well-documented adverse reaction to the drug. Atenolol is a beta-blocker commonly used to manage hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Adverse reactions and potential side effects listed in the label primarily relate to the cardiovascular system (e.g., bradycardia, hypotension), the central nervous system (e.g., dizziness, fatigue), the respiratory system (e.g., wheeziness, dyspnea), and other general symptoms like gastrointestinal disturbances.

However, the provided label does mention ""renal failure"" under the acute myocardial infarction section as an adverse event reported during atenolol administration, with a frequency of 1 occurrence (0.4%) in a study of 477 patients. This indicates that there may be a rare association between atenolol and renal-related adverse events, but given the very low incidence reported (1 case), it cannot be conclusively linked as a common adverse reaction to atenolol without additional evidence.

During the postmarketing experience, there is no mention of acute kidney injury being directly associated with atenolol use. Postmarketing surveillance often helps identify rarer adverse effects that may not have been detected in clinical trials due to smaller sample sizes. While acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed, this does not entirely exclude the possibility since drug effects can be complex, and unforeseen reactions can occur.

In conclusion, there is no significant evidence in the provided label to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and atenolol exposure based on clinical trials or post-market surveillance. The single 0.4% incidence of renal failure reported in an atenolol study suggests that if there is a relationship, it is expected to be rare. It is always critical for clinicians to monitor kidney function in patients taking medications with potential renal effects, especially in cases where patients have pre-existing kidney conditions or other risk factors for renal impairment. For a more definitive assessment, further research and detailed case studies specifically investigating the occurrence of acute   kidney injury in patients taking atenolol would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,atezolizumab,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ) is limited and derived mainly from TECENTRIQ's adverse event profile and immune-mediated side effects documented in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.

Atezolizumab, a PD-L1 blocking antibody, has been associated with immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, which can present as AKI. The clinical trials referenced within the label have reported incidences of immune-mediated nephritis, as outlined below:

1. **TECENTRIQ as a Single Agent**:
   - Within the large patient cohort (2616 patients), there was a reported incidence of less than 0.1% for immune-mediated nephritis, classified as a Grade 3 adverse reaction which led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ. The affected patient required systemic corticosteroids, but the nephritis did not resolve.
  
2. **TECENTRIQ in Combination with Cobimetinib and Vemurafenib**: 
   - In the clinical trial (230 patients), immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in 1.3% of patients, with Grade 2 severity. Some required permanent discontinuation or withholding of TECENTRIQ. Systemic corticosteroids were used for treatment, and nephritis resolved in all affected patients.
    
It is essential to note that drug labels usually include a summary of all significant adverse effects, both clinically significant and those with lesser impact. An explicit connection between atezolizumab and AKI is not stated in the reported adverse reactions from the clinical trial data sections provided. This suggests that if AKI is a potential adverse effect of atezolizumab, it might occur at a low incidence rate or may not have been clearly distinguished from nephritis in the provided data.

Additionally, post-marketing surveillance might provide supplementary information on AKI cases following atezolizumab administration. However, a specific incidence rate or detailed information on these cases is not provided in the drug label information you presented.

In conclusion, there is evidence of immune-mediated nephritis related to atezolizumab from clinical trials, which could manifest as AKI. Nonetheless, the data specifically mentioning AKI as an adverse reaction is not highlighted in the information provided. Healthcare providers should monitor kidney function in patients on atezolizumab and manage any suspected cases of nephritis promptly to prevent progression to AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,atovaquone,,"There is evidence suggesting that acute kidney injury (AKI) can be an adverse reaction following drug exposure to atovaquone. The relationship between atovaquone and AKI is supported by data from postmarketing experience.

From the provided drug label information, acute renal impairment is listed under the ""Renal and Urinary Disorders"" subheading in the ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" section. This indicates that cases of acute renal impairment have been identified during the post-approval use of atovaquone oral suspension. It is important to note that postmarketing reports are voluntary and the frequency or a direct causal relationship to drug exposure is not always clear due to the uncertain size of the population from which these reports are collected.

In the clinical trial summaries and specific adverse reaction frequencies provided in the labeling, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury in the context of the listed adverse reactions from “6.1 Clinical Trials Experience” for PCP prevention and treatment trials. One case of elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels is mentioned, which can be indicative of renal impairment. However, the label does not clarify if this instance is categorized as acute kidney injury. 

Given the lack of quantitative data or more specific clinic trial-related evidence directly associating atovaquone with AKI, the evidence primarily resides in the realm of postmarketing experience, which can signal potential adverse reactions but does not establish incidence or causality. Therefore, clinicians should consider the potential for AKI when prescribing atovaquone, monitor renal function as appropriate, and report any suspected cases of drug-related AKI to continue improving the understanding of this drug's safety profile.",NA
acute kidney injury,avapritinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to avapritinib, which is marketed under the brand name AYVAKIT, can be found in the drug label's section on adverse reactions arising from clinical trials.

Within the ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" section, it is noted that serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients receiving AYVAKIT. Specifically, acute kidney injury was reported in 2% of patients receiving the medication for unresectable or metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) in the NAVIGATOR study. Due to these reactions, some patients required a permanent discontinuation of AYVAKIT.

Furthermore, within the ""Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis"" subsection, it is mentioned that serious adverse reactions including acute kidney injury occurred in both 34% of patients receiving the recommended starting dose of 200 mg once daily and 50% of patients receiving AYVAKIT at all doses, as evaluated in the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER studies.

Laboratory abnormalities observed in NAVIGATOR are summarized in Table 6, where increased creatinine levels, which may indicate kidney injury, were seen in 29% of patients at all grades, although Grade ≥ 3 increases in creatinine were not provided.

The labeling also provides guidance for healthcare professionals on monitoring and handling cases of acute kidney injury, indicating that it is an expected potential complication of treatment with avapritinib. It suggests that permanent discontinuation of AYVAKIT may be necessary in response to adverse reactions in some patients, including those with acute kidney injury.

To conclude, evidence from clinical trials, specifically NAVIGATOR, EXPLORER, and PATHFINDER studies, supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and avapritinib exposure. Acute kidney injury was reported as a serious adverse reaction in these trials, affecting a small percentage of patients and resulting in changes to treatment including dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation.

No evidence from post-marketing surveillance is provided in the summary, indicating the primary evidence is from controlled clinical trial settings. However, post-marketing surveillance could offer further real-world insights into this adverse reaction, so healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to Blueprint Medicines Corporation or the FDA.",NA
acute kidney injury,avelumab,,"Based on the extensive information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as detailed in the drug label sections 6 ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" and 5 ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS,"" there is supporting evidence of a relationship between acute kidney injury and the use of avelumab, which is also known by its brand name, BAVENCIO.

Clinical trials have reported instances of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in patients treated with avelumab. Specifically, the safety of avelumab was evaluated in multiple clinical trials including JAVELIN Solid Tumor, JAVELIN Merkel 200, JAVELIN Renal 101, and JAVELIN Bladder 100 across various indications, including metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC), urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma.

From the ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" section:
- Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients receiving BAVENCIO, and among those, acute kidney injury was included as one of the most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% of patients) in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial.
- In first-line maintenance treatment of urothelial carcinoma, as per the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, 1.7% of patients experienced serious adverse reactions of acute kidney injury.
- In the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial, acute kidney injury was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 1.4% of patients treated with BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib for advanced renal cell carcinoma.

The ""5. WARN your patients about specific issues"" section provides further context about immune-mediated adverse reactions, including immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, which occurred in 0.1% (2/1854) of patients receiving avelumab. This suggests a mechanistic link whereby the use of avelumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, can induce an immune-mediated process that could potentially cause kidney injury as an adverse reaction. It is stated that immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction led to permanent discontinuation of BAVENCIO in 0.1% of patients and resolved in 50% of cases.

Considering the evidence from clinical trials and the known pharmacodynamic properties of avelumab, which include the possibility of inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions, there is credible evidence supporting a relationship between avelumab and the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury.

The evidence from these trials should be interpreted in the context of the drug's overall profile, including its mechanism of immune activation, which can theoretically affect any organ system, including the kidneys. Clinicians should carefully monitor patients receiving avelumab for any signs of renal dysfunction and manage according to the current clinical guidelines for immune-mediated adverse reactions.","The provided drug label for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) indicates acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction seen in clinical trials. Specifically, it is mentioned that serious adverse reactions in the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, which evaluated avelumab in urothelial carcinoma, included acute kidney injury at an incidence of 1.7%. Additionally, within the safety evaluation section for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it is noted that patients treated with avelumab in combination with axitinib experienced serious adverse reactions including acute kidney injury (1.4%).

This information contradicts the premise of refuting AKI as an adverse reaction of avelumab, as the clinical trial evidence presented in the drug label directly associates AKI with avelumab treatment. Furthermore, the warning and precautions section of the label explicitly mentions immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction as a possible issue, with an occurrence of 0.1% in patients receiving avelumab. 

Therefore, based on the information in the drug label, there is evidence supporting AKI as a potential adverse reaction to avelumab, and no evidence refuting it. Thus, the answer to the request for evidence refuting the relationship between AKI and avelumab is 'NA', as the adverse reaction is indeed related to the drug according to the label."
acute kidney injury,axitinib,,"Evidence for the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and axitinib exposure is found within the drug label provided under the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section, as well as in the reported adverse reactions from clinical trials. Specifically, the following points summarize the evidence:

1. **Clinical Trials:**
   - According to the label, serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients receiving axitinib in combination with avelumab as part of the JAVELIN Renal 101 clinical trial. Within this subset of reactions, acute kidney injury was reported in 1.4% of the patients.
   - The KEYNOTE-426 clinical trial, which investigated the safety of axitinib in combination with pembrolizumab, reported serious adverse reactions in 40% of patients. Among these, AKI was reported in 2.3% of the patients.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
   - The post-marketing experience does not specifically list AKI as an adverse reaction, but given that clinical trials report AKI, its occurrence post-marketing would not be unexpected.

3. **Additional Contextual Information from the Drug Label:**
   - The incidence of AKI among axitinib-related adverse events has been serious enough to warrant inclusion in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section of the drug label, which emphasizes the importance of this potential adverse reaction.
   
Overall, the evidence supporting the relationship between AKI and axitinib involves a small percentage of patients from large clinical trials. While the absolute risk may appear low, the inclusion in official labeling indicates clinical relevance and a need for awareness among healthcare providers. Monitoring for AKI is advised when patients are treated with axitinib, whether as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs such as avelumab or pembrolizumab. The sources of this evidence are direct references to findings in the clinical studies JAVELIN Renal 101 and KEYNOTE-426 as detailed in the provided drug label sections.",NA
acute kidney injury,axitinib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction of axitinib comes from clinical trial experience, specifically in the context of combination therapy for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In clinical trials evaluating the combination of axitinib with avelumab in the JAVELIN Renal 101 study, there was a reported incidence of serious adverse reactions related to AKI in 1.4% of the patients. Additionally, AKI led to permanent discontinuation of either axitinib or avelumab in some cases. During these trials, it was also noted that adverse reactions required dose interruptions or reductions in a significant number of patients, which included AKI as one of the reasons.

The safety of axitinib in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in the KEYNOTE-426 study. Similarly, AKI was mentioned as a serious adverse reaction, with an occurrence of 2.3% in patients receiving the combination therapy. It was again noted that permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction of either axitinib or pembrolizumab occurred in some patients due to AKI.

It is important to consider that the data provided does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between axitinib and AKI, but it does note AKI as a serious adverse reaction in the context of combination therapies involving axitinib in the clinical trial setting. Moreover, the label advises monitoring for AKI as part of the safety considerations for patients undergoing treatment with axitinib.

There is no specific mention of post-marketing surveillance data in the sections provided, and the summary of clinical trial experiences included in the drug's labeling suggests that AKI is considered a possible adverse reaction when axitinib is used, particularly in combination with other immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of advanced RCC.

Source: The evidence has been summarized from adverse reaction descriptions and trial results outlined in the drug label sections provided, specifically under ""JAVELIN Renal 101"" and ""KEYNOTE-426"" for the combination treatments with axitinib.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of axitinib is supported by evidence from clinical trials. The provided drug label from axitinib (INLYTA) includes a section on serious adverse reactions which notes that AKI occurred in 1.4% of patients when used in combination with avelumab (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, First-Line Advanced RCC, INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab). This information refutes the claim that AKI is not an adverse reaction of axitinib, as it has been documented as a serious adverse reaction in a clinical trial setting.

There is no section within the provided text specifically indicating evidence refuting the relationship between AKI and axitinib. Generally, evidence refuting a relationship is derived from comprehensive reviews of clinical trial data or large observational studies where the incidence of the adverse event (in this case, AKI) is not significantly different in the drug-exposed group compared to the control group, or where there is a clear alternative explanation for the adverse reaction.

In the absence of such evidence refuting the relationship, as well as considering the documented occurrence of AKI in the context of axitinib use in a clinical trial, the response to this inquiry is not ""NA"". However, evidence can evolve over time, and newer studies or analysis could potentially offer evidence to refute this relationship. As of now, based on the drug label provided, there is evidence supporting the occurrence of AKI as an adverse reaction of axitinib."
acute kidney injury,azacitidine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between drug exposure to azacitidine (VIDAZA) and acute kidney injury (AKI) requires evaluation of various sources including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. However, from the sections provided, which include adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings from the drug label, acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction or a specific warning. 

In the ""Warnings and Precautions"" (5.4) section, renal toxicity is mentioned, indicating incidents of elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for non-MDS conditions. There's also mention of renal tubular acidosis in patients with CML treated with azacitidine and etoposide. This suggests that while direct evidence of AKI specifically associated with azacitidine is not provided, there is acknowledgment of potential renal toxicity associated with azacitidine use, particularly in certain populations or when used concomitantly with other drugs.

Additionally, under ""Renal Toxicity"" (5.4), monitoring of serum creatinine and electrolytes is recommended before initiating therapy and with each cycle. The fact that this monitoring is recommended indicates a recognized risk to renal function when using azacitidine.

While these sections highlight the potential for renal-related toxicities, including AKI, they do not provide a direct causal relationship or quantifiable evidence such as incidence rates or the nature of the renal injuries observed. Post-marketing surveillance (6.2) mentions additional adverse reactions identified after the drug has been marketed, but again, AKI is not specifically listed. 

In conclusion, the sections of the drug label provided indicate a consideration for potential renal toxicities associated with azacitidine use but do not include specific evidence for acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. It is possible that such evidence might exist in the broader scientific literature, case reports, or detailed analyses of clinical trial data; however, this has not been provided in the information available from the drug label sections shared. For a comprehensive assessment, further details from clinical studies, case reports, and other scientific evidence would be needed.",NA
acute kidney injury,azithromycin,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction to Azithromycin:

Clinical Trials Experience:
The provided drug label for azithromycin (sections 6.1 and 6.3) does not list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal in nature, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. While there were reports of nephritis and abnormal liver function in a few instances, these did not appear prominent among the trial participants. Furthermore, there were reports of laboratory abnormalities including elevated serum creatinine, which can be associated with kidney dysfunction, but the majority of subjects with these elevated levels had abnormal values at baseline, suggesting a pre-existing condition.

Postmarketing Experience:
During the postmarketing period, more adverse events can be uncovered due to the larger and more diverse patient population. The provided label material (section 6.2) indicates that interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure have been reported with azithromycin use post-approval. However, because these reports are voluntary and come from an uncertain population size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

Warnings and Precautions:
No specific mention of acute kidney injury or related warnings are found in the provided sections (5.1 through 5.9) that would suggest a recognized risk of AKI associated with azithromycin use.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided drug label information for azithromycin, there is limited evidence from postmarketing surveillance reports indicating that acute kidney injury can occur in association with azithromycin use. However, this evidence does not allow for a definitive causal relationship to be established due to the voluntary and potentially underreported nature of postmarketing adverse event data. The lack of prominent reports of AKI in clinical trials further complicates the establishment of a strong link between azithromycin and acute kidney injury. Overall, while there may be a potential association, the evidence does not strongly support a frequent or well-characterized risk of AKI with azithromycin use. Healthcare professionals should consider this information and remain vigilant for renal adverse effects when prescribing azithromycin, especially in patients with preexisting kidney conditions or other risk factors for kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,baclofen,,"The provided drug label sections for baclofen list various adverse reactions observed in clinical settings, such as transient drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, and fatigue, among others. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly mentioned as a common or rare adverse reaction in the sections provided.

Although the label does not specifically list AKI as an adverse reaction of baclofen, the absence of this information in the label does not necessarily imply there is no potential relationship. To fully determine if there is supporting evidence of a connection between AKI and baclofen use, a review of clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports beyond the label would be necessary.

A thorough search of the biomedical literature, including clinical databases like PubMed, might reveal case reports or observational studies examining the association of AKI with baclofen. This could include rare case reports of AKI that could be attributed to baclofen, either due to direct nephrotoxicity, an idiosyncratic reaction, or a consequence of another drug-related event (e.g., severe dehydration secondary to another side effect like nausea or vomiting).

In summary, based on the sections of the drug label provided for baclofen, there is no direct evidence listed for AKI being an adverse reaction to baclofen. For a comprehensive evaluation, one would need to review scientific literature beyond the drug label for any rare or less commonly reported adverse events that may not be included in the label. If such evidence is found in the literature, it should be described in detail regarding the nature of the reported AKI cases, their causality assessment, and any identified risk factors. If no evidence is found, it should be stated that, as per the available sources, there is no known link between baclofen exposure and AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,balsalazide,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for balsalazide, acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction that can potentially be associated with the use of this medication. The evidence for this association is outlined in the following sections of the label:

1. **Warnings and Precautions (5.1 Renal Impairment)** - The label cautions that renal impairment, including minimal change disease, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and renal failure, has been reported in patients using balsalazide disodium, which releases mesalamine into the gastrointestinal tract. It is advised to assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Additionally, there is guidance to discontinue balsalazide if renal function deteriorates while on therapy.

2. **Postmarketing Experience (6.2)** - The postmarketing experience section indicates that renal failure and interstitial nephritis have been identified adverse reactions during post-approval use of balsalazide or other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine. However, it is noted that since these reactions are reported voluntarily from an uncertain population size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The sections mentioned do not include evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials regarding acute kidney injury specifically associated with balsalazide. Rather, they indicate general warnings and reports of renal issues in the postmarketing setting. Clinical trials data presented in the label primarily highlight the adverse reactions that were most frequently reported, such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and others, without specifically mentioning acute kidney injury.

In summary, the relationship between balsalazide and the potential for acute kidney injury appears to stem from warnings and precautions related to renal impairment, as well as cases reported in the postmarketing experience. However, the exact incidence or strength of this relationship is not quantified in the provided label sections.

Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions associated with balsalazide to the FDA's MedWatch program and the drug's manufacturer, as postmarketing data contributes to understanding the full safety profile of the drug.",NA
acute kidney injury,belantamab mafodotin,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:

The safety of belantamab mafodotin, known by its brand name BLENREP, was evaluated during the DREAMM-2 study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In this study, belantamab mafodotin was administered intravenously at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg once every three weeks to a subset of patients (n = 95).

A serious adverse reaction observed in 4.2% of these patients was renal impairment, which is relevant since acute kidney injury (AKI) falls within the spectrum of renal impairment. Additionally, among the most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (occurring in ≥5% of patients), an increased creatinine level was reported, indicating impaired kidney function, which can be indicative of AKI.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:

No specific post-marketing surveillance data concerning the relationship between acute kidney injury and belantamab mafodotin were provided or highlighted within the information given. In the absence of explicit post-marketing data, it is unclear whether further cases of AKI have been reported following BLENREP's wider use in clinical practice.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the DREAMM-2 clinical trial, there is some support for a relationship between belantamab mafodotin and renal impairment, including AKI, as evidenced by a small percentage of serious renal impairment adverse reactions and increased creatinine levels in patients. However, in clinical contexts, the attribution of AKI to drug exposure must be carefully evaluated considering other factors such as patient comorbidities and concomitant medications. 

The presence of renal impairment should be monitored in patients receiving belantamab mafodotin, and health care providers should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of AKI, as recommended in the provided safety information under Warnings and Precautions. Additional studies and post-marketing surveillance would be helpful to further elucidate this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,belatacept,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for belatacept (marketed as NULOJIX), there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) directly attributed to belatacept exposure in the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings sections of the label. The detailed clinical trial experience, adverse reactions in postmarketing experience, and long-term extension studies do not explicitly list AKI as an observed adverse reaction.

However, several renal-related adverse reactions are documented, including:

1. Polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, which is mentioned as associated with deteriorating renal function and potential kidney graft loss (Warning and Precautions 5.5 and Adverse Reactions 6.1).
2. Hematuria, proteinuria, dysuria, and renal tubular necrosis are listed among the adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥10% in patients treated with the recommended regimen of NULOJIX (Adverse Reaction 6.1).
3. There is a reference to renal impairment, including acute renal failure, but it is under ""selected adverse reactions occurring in <10%"" and does not clarify a definitive link to belatacept (Adverse Reaction 6.1).

Given this information, while AKI is not explicitly stated as an adverse reaction to belatacept, there are various renal-related adverse events reported which could potentially relate to or cause acute kidney dysfunction. To conclusively determine AKI as a specific adverse reaction of belatacept, individual case reviews, additional clinical trials, or epidemiological studies focused on renal function post-exposure to belatacept would be required.

In the absence of direct evidence linking belatacept to AKI listed in this label, it cannot be stated with certainty that AKI is an identified adverse reaction of belatacept. Physicians and healthcare providers usually rely on reported clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and published case reports to monitor for such connections. Therefore, one should refer to the most current medical literature, drug databases, and ongoing post-marketing surveillance data for any emerging evidence on this potential association.",NA
acute kidney injury,belatacept,,"The provided drug label information for belatacept (marketed as NULOJIX) does not directly mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. Instead, it discusses a range of adverse reactions and warnings which include post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), malignancies, serious infections, polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), among others.

However, under the ""Renal and Urinary Disorders"" subsection of adverse reactions, the label indicates reports of hematuria, proteinuria, and renal tubular necrosis. Additionally, a notable finding mentioned is that BK virus-associated nephropathy was reported, which could potentially lead to kidney graft loss. Although PVAN could potentially involve kidney injury, acute kidney injury as a term is not specified within the adverse reactions or warnings for this drug.

To summarize, there is no direct evidence in the provided label indicating that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction to belatacept based on clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically detailed in this document. It is recommended to review the latest available medical literature or contact the manufacturer for further inquiries about a potential association between belatacept exposure and acute kidney injury not detailed in the drug label.",NA
acute kidney injury,belumosudil,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for belumosudil (marketed as REZUROCK), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction (≥20%) detected from clinical trials. The adverse reactions outlined primarily include infections, asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, edema, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, decreased phosphate, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, decreased lymphocytes, and hypertension.

However, under the adverse reactions leading to dose interruption, renal failure is mentioned, with a frequency of 2%, though it is not specified whether this encompasses acute kidney injury. The term ""renal failure"" does indicate severe impairment of kidney function, which can include acute kidney injury, but without specific details, it is not clear if the cases referred to are cases of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or other forms of kidney failure.

The laboratory abnormalities section of the label includes ""Creatinine increased,"" with 3% of patients experiencing Grade 3-4 increases. Elevated serum creatinine is a laboratory marker often associated with impaired kidney function, which could indicate acute kidney injury, especially if the increase is rapid. Nevertheless, without a direct reference to acute kidney injury, it cannot be unequivocally confirmed from the information provided that this adverse reaction is publicly recognized as associated with the use of REZUROCK.

There are also no specific box warnings or highlighted precautions on the label linking belumosudil to acute kidney injury. 

As there are no explicit mentions of acute kidney injury in the sections you've provided, one cannot conclusively state there is known evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to belumosudil, based on the current labeling.

For a more comprehensive assessment, additional information such as post-marketing surveillance reports, detailed clinical study data, and cumulative safety analyses would be necessary to ascertain if there is evidence of a relationship between acute kidney injury and belumosudil. If concerned about this potential adverse effect, healthcare professionals may choose to monitor kidney function (e.g., serum creatinine) in patients taking REZUROCK, particularly those with risk factors for kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,bendamustine,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and bendamustine exposure is not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections for adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings. The adverse reactions and hematology laboratory test value abnormalities that have been reported post-marketing and during clinical trials have focused on other aspects of the drug's impact on patients' health, such as myelosuppression, infections, tumor lysis syndrome, and hepatotoxicity, rather than specifically on renal function or AKI.

The label does mention that ""Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride may also have changes in their creatinine levels,"" which indicates that there might be an effect on kidney function. However, the provided sections do not offer details regarding the frequency, severity, or the clinical context (such as predisposing factors) of AKI episodes. Furthermore, the post-marketing experience section does not list AKI or related renal issues as an identified adverse reaction. Therefore, within the scope of this label information, there is no direct evidence linking bendamustine with AKI as an adverse event.

To further assess the potential for AKI as an adverse reaction to bendamustine, other sources of clinical evidence such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and additional post-marketing surveillance data not included in the drug label would need to be reviewed. Without such data, it is not possible to establish a causal or associative relationship between bendamustine exposure and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,bendamustine,,"The provided drug label information does not directly mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction to the drug bendamustine. However, it does note that renal failure has been reported in cases of tumor lysis syndrome, which is a known adverse reaction associated with the use of bendamustine. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) can indeed lead to acute kidney injury due to the rapid release of intracellular contents from lysed tumor cells, which can cause renal precipitation and subsequent renal impairment.

The drug label explains that TLS associated with bendamustine has occurred in patients during clinical trials and post-marketing reports (Section 5.5). Specifically, the development of TLS tends to happen within the first treatment cycle and may lead to acute renal failure and death if not managed properly. Preventive steps include hydration and monitoring blood chemistry, with a special focus on potassium and uric acid levels. While allopurinol can be used for prevention, there is a caution regarding an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when administered concurrently with bendamustine.

Other relevant information from the label includes the reporting of serious adverse reactions in post-marketing experiences, such as acute renal failure (Section 6.2), although it is not explicitly stated whether these instances of acute renal failure are directly a result of AKI or part of the systemic complications related to TLS.

In conclusion, while the provided drug label does not explicitly state AKI as a direct adverse reaction to bendamustine, there is evidence of a relationship between bendamustine use and acute renal failure in the context of tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to AKI. Healthcare providers should be vigilant about monitoring patients for TLS and renal function, especially during the initial treatment cycles with bendamustine.",NA
acute kidney injury,bexagliflozin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for bexagliflozin (BRENZAVVY), evidence regarding acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction includes the following:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**:
   - The clinical trials conducted for bexagliflozin included subjects with a baseline renal function of eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 98% of patients and eGFR 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 2% of patients (mean eGFR 92 mL/min/1.73 m2).

2. **Volume Depletion Warning**:
   - Bexagliflozin is noted to cause intravascular volume contraction, which could manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine (Section 5.3).
   - There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors like bexagliflozin.
   - Patients with impaired renal function, the elderly, and those on diuretics or with low systolic blood pressure may be at increased risk of volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating treatment in such patients, volume status and renal function should be assessed.

3. **Laboratory Abnormalities**:
   - Initiating BRENZAVVY can lead to increased serum creatinine and a decrease in eGFR within the first weeks of treatment, stabilizing around weeks 6 to 12. In patients with moderate renal impairment, there was an observed decrease in eGFR of 4.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 after starting bexagliflozin (as compared to a change in serum creatinine of 0.0 mg/dL and a decrease in eGFR of 0.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group).

Acute kidney injury may be associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, including bexagliflozin, due to their mechanism of action and impact on renal physiology, particularly related to volume contraction and hemodynamic changes. As a result, patients on bexagliflozin are advised to be monitored for signs of AKI and volume depletion, especially those at risk due to renal impairment, use of diuretics, or other volume-affecting conditions.

However, specifically within this drug label section, acute kidney injury is not directly listed as a common adverse reaction or side effect. The relationship is more so inferred from the physiological effects of the drug and the associated risks, such as volume depletion and increased serum creatinine levels.

For a conclusive assertion, it would be important to refer to peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance data that explicitly correlate bexagliflozin use with incidents of AKI. If such specific data were not available, one would have to rely on the broader understanding of SGLT2 inhibitors' impact on renal function to infer a potential relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,bexarotene,,"Based on the provided drug label information, acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction to bexarotene (Targretin) in either the adverse reactions section or within the warnings and precautions. However, bexarotene has been reported to cause several other adverse effects that are well-documented, including hyperlipidemia, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, hypothyroidism, neutropenia, and cataracts, as stated in the adverse reactions and warnings. Increased creatinine, indicating a negative impact on kidney function, was noted at a lower incidence (less than 10%) in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

Clinical trials on bexarotene have reported the most common adverse reactions observed in patients with CTCL and have detailed incidences of abnormalities in laboratory tests, including metabolic and nutritional disorders. Adverse events leading to the dose reduction or discontinuation of bexarotene in at least two patients include hyperlipidemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. Among these adverse events, pancreatitis and liver function test abnormalities could suggest an indirect relationship with renal function, but acute kidney injury as a direct adverse effect is not specified.

There is a mention of kidney function abnormalities with a low incidence rate, suggesting potential renal implications, but whether these are acute or chronic in nature or directly attributable to acute kidney injury is not clear.

In conclusion, there is no direct evidence provided in the drug label indicating that acute kidney function is a recognized adverse reaction of bexarotene. The evidence for bexarotene-induced acute kidney injury would have to be sourced from additional clinical case reports, post-marketing surveillance data, or other scientific publications beyond the drug label.","Evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and bexarotene exposure is implicit in the absence of AKI from the list of reported adverse reactions in clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and various sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions) of the drug label information provided.

Specifically:
- The drug label’s section 6 on adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions requiring detailed consideration within other sections of the prescribing information, does not mention AKI.
- Tables detailing clinical trial experience (Table 2), the incidence of moderately severe and severe adverse events (Table 3), and treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory values (Table 4) do not report kidney injury as an observed outcome.
- The urogenital adverse reactions listed include various conditions but do not mention AKI (e.g., albuminuria, hematuria, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, dysuria, and a generic ""kidney function abnormal"").
- The warnings and precautions section highlights severe hyperlipidemia, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, hypothyroidism, neutropenia, and several other conditions, yet AKI is not identified as a risk for patients taking bexarotene.

Therefore, while AKI is not explicitly refuted as an adverse reaction to bexarotene, its omission from extensive clinical documentation suggests no recognized association. If AKI were a significant concern associated with bexarotene, it would likely be mentioned in the sections devoted to adverse reactions and warned against in the labeling. However, the fact that AKI is not mentioned does not categorically rule out its occurrence. The available evidence (or lack thereof) does not support AKI as an expected adverse reaction to bexarotene based on the provided label information."
acute kidney injury,binimetinib,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for binimetinib (MEKTOVI), there is evidence supporting the relationship between binimetinib exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the adverse reactions section of the PHAROS clinical study, acute kidney injury is mentioned as an adverse reaction leading to dose interruptions in 5% of patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, in Table 5 under the PHAROS study, AKI (which includes acute kidney injury) is among the adverse reactions leading to dose modifications.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
The drug label does not explicitly mention post-marketing surveillance data for acute kidney injury related to MEKTOVI.

In summary, evidence from the PHAROS clinical trial supports that acute kidney injury can be an adverse reaction in patients taking binimetinib in combination with encorafenib, leading to dose adjustments. It is important to monitor renal function when prescribing this medication, as kidney injury is a recognized complication. Specific data on post-marketing surveillance regarding AKI due to binimetinib is not provided in the excerpt of the drug label. However, reporting of suspected adverse reactions to both the pharmaceutical company (Pfizer) and the FDA is encouraged for ongoing surveillance.",NA
acute kidney injury,blinatumomab,,"Upon review of the provided drug label sections for blinatumomab (BLINCYTO), there is no direct evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury (AKI) is an established adverse reaction to this medication. While the sections detail a range of possible adverse reactions and warnings, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological toxicities, infections, tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, elevated liver enzymes, pancreatitis, and leukoencephalopathy, they do not explicitly list AKI as a known side effect.

In clinical trials, infusion-related reactions are noted, which include a composite term also encompassing pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, myalgia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and rash erythematous. However, acute kidney injury seems to be mentioned here in the context of a cluster of symptoms that can occur during infusion and does not appear to be a common or well-established adverse effect of the drug based on the reported clinical trial data.

Additionally, the post-marketing experience lists fatal pancreatitis in patients receiving BLINCYTO in combination with dexamethasone, but there is no specific mention of AKI. Furthermore, the laboratory abnormalities noted in clinical trials do not emphasize renal function markers that would suggest AKI is a concern.

It is important to recognize that this summary is not exhaustive and does not include other possible sources of evidence on AKI linked to blinatumomab use, such as case studies or other clinical literature beyond the drug label. However, based on the provided sections of the drug label alone, AKI is not explicitly identified as an established adverse reaction to blinatumomab. If there are concerns about AKI in patients treated with blinatumomab or if AKI has been observed in clinical practice, healthcare providers should report these incidents to the drug manufacturer (Amgen Inc.) or FDA for further investigation and potential inclusion in future safety surveillance analyses.

For the most current information and personalized medical advice, healthcare practitioners should consult the full prescribing information, FDA updates, and continually evaluate the scientific literature.",NA
acute kidney injury,blinatumomab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for blinatumomab, evidence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to the drug does not appear to be directly listed or specified in the sections covering clinical trials experience (6.1), post-marketing experience (6.2), specific warnings, or box warnings. The most common adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions described are related to hematologic effects (such as neutropenia and febrile neutropenia), infections, neurological toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, and liver enzyme elevations. While infusion-related reactions are mentioned, which encompass a variety of potential side effects, acute kidney injury is not included among them.

In the clinical trials experience section, general organ disorders, infections, and hematological and neurological disorders are highlighted as notable adverse reactions, both common and serious. Renal issues like acute kidney injury are not mentioned in the summaries for adverse reactions in adult patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL or Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL.

In the postmarketing experience, fatal pancreatitis is mentioned in patients receiving blinatumomab in combination with dexamethasone, but no mention is made of acute kidney injury or renal-related issues.

In the warnings and precautions section (5), infections, cytokine release syndrome, neurological toxicities, tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, effects on the ability to drive and use machines, elevated liver enzymes, pancreatitis, leukoencephalopathy, preparation and administration errors, and other specific concerns like immunization, benzyl alcohol toxicity in neonates, and embryo-fetal toxicity are addressed, but again, acute kidney injury is not specifically included.

In summary, the provided labeling sections for blinatumomab do not list acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction based on clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, or within specific warnings. Therefore, no known evidence supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and blinatumomab exposure as per the provided drug label sections. If new evidence has emerged since the last update of the drug label, it would not be covered in this current analysis. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, consultation of the latest medical literature and drug safety databases would be necessary.","NA

The provided drug label information does not reveal evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the use of blinatumomab. Instead, it includes extensive information about known adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with blinatumomab based on clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned in these sections, suggesting that it has not been characterized as a common or well-documented adverse reaction of blinatumomab. However, the lack of mention does not completely rule out the possibility as new side effects can emerge post-marketing. It is always essential to report suspected adverse reactions to appropriate medical authorities for further investigation and monitoring."
acute kidney injury,bortezomib,,"The provided sections from the drug label mention various adverse reactions and warnings associated with bortezomib but do not explicitly describe acute kidney injury as a recognized adverse event. Bortezomib is known to be associated with several important side effects, including peripheral neuropathy, hypotension, cardiac toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), gastrointestinal toxicity, thrombocytopenia/neutropenia, tumour lysis syndrome, hepatic toxicity, thrombotic microangiopathy, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Based on the evidence from the provided label sections:

1. Clinical Trials: The label details the most commonly observed adverse reactions in clinical trials involving multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma patients receiving bortezomib, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. Adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms were reported with varying incidences.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance: The label also mentions adverse reactions identified from post-marketing experience, highlighting them as voluntary reports from a global population, without clear evidence of their frequency or causal relationship to bortezomib exposure.

3. Warnings: Several warnings are included in the label, describing the potential for serious adverse reactions like peripheral neuropathy, hypotension, cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, PRES, gastrointestinal toxicity, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, tumor lysis syndrome, hepatic toxicity, thrombotic microangiopathy, and risk to a fetus.

While acute kidney injury is a serious potential adverse reaction to various medications, the sections of the bortezomib label provided do not include acute kidney injury as a reported adverse reaction from clinical trials or post-market surveillance, nor is it listed under the warnings or precautions.

In the absence of specific mentions in the provided drug label sections, it is important to consult additional sources such as more recent studies, literature reviews, and case reports to determine whether there is known evidence of a relationship between bortezomib exposure and acute kidney injury. Clinicians should rely on the entirety of available medical literature and clinical judgment when considering the risk of kidney injury with bortezomib use.",NA
acute kidney injury,bosutinib,,"Evidence supports the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and bosutinib exposure based on clinical trial results and post-marketing experience. In the sections detailing adverse reactions and renal toxicity under the safety information of bosutinib, AKI is explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials:
- In a single-arm clinical trial that included patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, among 546 patients, there were reports of fatal adverse reactions due to acute kidney injury, representing a rate of 0.2%. This occurs in the context of the drug exposure [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Table 6].

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Aside from clinical trials, the post-marketing experience with bosutinib has identified additional adverse reactions, which include cases of acute kidney injury. Because post-marketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, the exact frequency of AKI occurrence is not easily estimated, but the report's inclusion in the label indicates recognition of AKI as an adverse reaction in the broader patient population taking the drug [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Renal Toxicity Warning:
- Within the warnings and precautions, renal toxicity is explicitly recognized with bosutinib use. An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed, indicating renal dysfunction. Patients with baseline renal impairment or at risk of renal dysfunction were advised to have their renal function monitored regularly during bosutinib therapy, with suggestion of possible dose adjustment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Overall, based on the information extracted from the clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and renal toxicity warnings, there is evidence to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and bosutinib exposure. It is essential for healthcare providers to monitor renal function in patients receiving bosutinib regularly, and consider dose adjustments or discontinuation if AKI develops.","Evidence suggesting that acute kidney injury (AKI) is not an adverse reaction to bosutinib:

The provided drug label sections for bosutinib (sections 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, as well as others) do not directly refute the relationship between bosutinib and the potential adverse reaction of AKI. However, it is important to note that while AKI is mentioned as a fatal adverse reaction in a very small number of patients within the postmarketing experience section (2 patients out of 546, which is approximately 0.4%), this does not establish a causal relationship but indicates an observed event during treatment. The label specifies that fatal adverse reactions occurred in 12 patients (2.2%) due to various causes, including AKI.

Considering that the drug label reports renal toxicity as a warning and precaution (section 5.6), and it discusses an on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), it supports the possibility that bosutinib can adversely impact renal function. Additionally, the most common laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials included increased creatinine levels, indicative of renal function alteration.

In summary, while the drug label for bosutinib does not contain direct evidence refuting the association of AKI as an adverse reaction to bosutinib, the reported occurrence of AKI within the clinical trials and postmarketing experiences is low, suggesting it is not a common reaction. Nonetheless, it is recognized as a serious, albeit rare, outcome in patients receiving the drug, particularly in those with predisposing factors, which is why there are specific recommendations for monitoring renal function during treatment. Clinicians should weigh the benefits of bosutinib against the potential risks for AKI, especially in patients with existing renal impairment or other risk factors."
acute kidney injury,bosutinib,,"**Evidence Summary: Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction of Bosutinib**

Clinical Trials:
- **Adult Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP CML**: The clinical trial included 268 patients, with median BOSULIF treatment duration of 55 months. Acute kidney injury was reported as a fatal adverse reaction in one patient (0.4%), implying a rare occurrence of severe renal toxicity in this population.

- **Adult Patients with CML resistant or intolerant to prior therapy**: The trial included 546 patients. Among these, one reported fatal adverse reaction was due to acute kidney injury (0.2%), indicating a rare but serious renal adverse effect in this subgroup.

Laboratory Abnormalities:
- **Adult and Pediatric CML Patients**: The adverse reactions section of both adult and pediatric clinical trial data consistently reports 'creatinine increased' in over 90% of cases, which can indicate renal impairment, including acute kidney injury. However, the direct association with acute renal failure is not extensively detailed, and the grading severity or the specific incidence rate of acute kidney injury is not provided.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- **Postmarketing Experience**: No specific mention of acute kidney injury is made under the 'Postmarketing Experience' section of the provided label information, suggesting that there is no significant additional data from post-market surveillance regarding acute kidney injury directly attributable to bosutinib use.

Warnings and Precautions:
- **Renal Toxicity (Section 5.6)**: The label advises monitoring for renal function due to an observed decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients treated with BOSULIF. It is worth noting that a decrease in eGFR may be consistent with acute kidney injury among other renal dysfunctions.

In conclusion, there is limited but serious evidence from clinical trials that acute kidney injury can occur as an adverse reaction to bosutinib. However, this appears to be a rare event. Increased creatinine levels, a marker that could indicate impaired kidney function, are a common laboratory finding in patients treated with bosutinib. Physical monitoring of renal function is recommended during therapy with bosutinib due to potential renal toxicity.","""NA"""
acute kidney injury,brentuximab vedotin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and brentuximab vedotin is not explicitly detailed in the provided sections of the drug label. The drug label mentions kidney-related warnings in section 5.6 ""Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Severe Renal Impairment,"" indicating increased frequency of ≥Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths in patients with severe renal impairment. However, a direct association with AKI is not specified in the provided text.

Drug labels and related documentation discuss known adverse reactions and risks based on clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and case studies. Although the label indicates a need for caution in patients with renal impairment, which may suggest some level of nephrotoxicity, it does not explicitly identify AKI as a documented adverse reaction to brentuximab vedotin.

In the absence of specific information within the provided sections linking brentuximab vedotin with AKI, further investigation into clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance outside of the label would be necessary to determine the strength of evidence for this potential adverse reaction.

Since this summary does not find evidence of AKI in the provided drug label sections, it is crucial to consult the full prescribing information or other medical literature sources for a complete understanding of all risks associated with brentuximab vedotin, including potential kidney-related events. Additionally, given the lack of explicit mention of AKI, one should not exclude the possibility; there may be case reports or additional studies that do provide evidence of such an association. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients for kidney function and consider the potential risks given the warning about severe renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,brentuximab vedotin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) and acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly stated in the sections provided, which summarize the adverse reactions, warnings, and safety concerns based on clinical trials and post-marketing experience with the drug. Specifically, the information does not mention AKI as a recognized adverse reaction directly associated with brettuximab vedotin.

However, Section 5.6 of the warnings and precautions does highlight ""Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Severe Renal Impairment,"" indicating that patients with severe renal impairment may experience a greater frequency of adverse reactions due to higher exposure to the active metabolite, MMAE. This implies that there is a concern about the drug's impact on kidney function, but it does not directly establish AKI as a common adverse reaction.

Additionally, in section 6.2 under Post Marketing Experience, some renal-related adverse reactions are mentioned, such as ""renal toxicity"" but without explicit mention of AKL. Although specific details on the occurrence of AKI due to brentuximab vedotin are lacking, the gathered information suggests that the drug should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing renal impairment due to the potential for increased toxicity.

It is important to note that this review is based on the provided sections of the drug label, and a thorough assessment of all available data, including a search of the scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and further safety reports, would be necessary to fully evaluate the evidence for AKI as an adverse reaction to brentuximab vedotin. If such additional data sources provide reports of AKI following treatment with brentuximab vedotin, this would contribute to the evidence base. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of AKI as a recognized adverse reaction in the drug label sections shared.",NA
acute kidney injury,budesonide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for budesonide, there is no direct evidence listed that supports a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and budesonide exposure. The label details various potential adverse reactions and warnings associated with budesonide, predominantly focusing on its effects related to infections, hypersensitivity reactions, immunosuppression, adrenal suppression, bone mineral density reduction, growth effects, ocular changes, and other organ-specific effects.

Clinical trials (Section 6.1) provide data on adverse reactions observed during the studies, none of which specifically mention AKI as an outcome. The trials monitored 945 patients aged 12 months to 8 years, reporting adverse reactions like respiratory infections, rhinitis, coughing, otitis media, viral infections, and gastrointestinal symptoms; acute kidney injury was not cited.

Post-marketing experience (Section 6.2) outlines additional adverse reactions reported after the drug's approval, which includes various systemic and localized conditions. While this can sometimes unveil rarer side effects not encountered during clinical trials, AKI is not listed among the reported reactions post-approval either.

As AKI is not mentioned as a potential adverse reaction from budesonide exposure in either clinical trials or post-marketing reports provided in the drug label, there is no known evidence within these specific sources to suggest an association. Should information outside of this label suggest otherwise, it's not reflected or indicated in the provided text.

For the most comprehensive assessment, literature searches, regulatory agency databases, and additional post-marketing surveillance data could provide further insights into any potential but undocumented relationship between budesonide and acute kidney injury. However, based on the information you have provided, no evidence has been established as of the last knowledge update.",NA
acute kidney injury,bumetanide,,"Based on the provided drug label information, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and bumetanide exposure primarily emerges from the listed adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported with its use.

Clinical Trials and Case Studies:
The adverse reactions list identifies ""renal failure"" (a term that can encompass acute kidney injury) as an adverse event that occurred in approximately 0.1% of patients. Although not the most frequent adverse reaction, its inclusion suggests that clinical trial data or case reports have documented renal failure in association with bumetanide use. The specific sources of these data (e.g., which clinical trials or case reports) are not provided in the label, so I cannot detail their design or results.

Lab Abnormalities:
Further evidence from the label under laboratory abnormalities shows that azotemia (increased nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood, which can indicate kidney dysfunction) was noted in 10.6% of patients tested, and increases in serum creatinine (a marker of kidney function) were observed in 7.4% of patients. These findings align with potential renal impairment, which can be a precursor or component of acute kidney injury.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Rare spontaneous post-marketing reports of thrombocytopenia are noted, which, while not directly related to kidney function, demonstrate that bumetanide's adverse effects can extend beyond the more commonly observed reactions and can be detected in the broader patient population after the drug's approval.

Warnings:
The warning section indicates that bumetanide is a potent diuretic, which, if given in excessive amounts or without proper medical supervision, can lead to profound diuresis with potential for water and electrolyte depletion. These conditions can stress the kidneys and might lead to or exacerbate acute kidney injury, especially in susceptible individuals.

Conclusion:
The evidence linking bumetanide with acute kidney injury includes documented cases of renal failure, as well as lab abnormalities indicative of kidney dysfunction, such as azotemia and increased serum creatinine levels. The mechanism by which bumetanide could cause kidney injury is indirectly supported by its pharmacological action as a potent diuretic, which can lead to water and electrolyte depletion if not carefully managed. These pieces of evidence are derived from clinical observations, laboratory findings, and inherent pharmacological action, as outlined in the drug's label.

It is important to note that acute kidney injury and renal failure notation in the drug label implies recognition of the relationship by the drug regulatory authority, based on their review of the evidence submitted, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports. However, since specific study details or case reports are not provided in the label, a comprehensive evaluation of the strength of this evidence is limited to what has been disclosed in the summary of product characteristics.",NA
acute kidney injury,cabazitaxel,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and cabazitaxel is identified in various sections of the drug's labeling reflecting data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and warnings and precautions.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- In the TROPIC trial, which compared JEVTANA (cabazitaxel) plus prednisone to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, deaths due to renal failure were reported in 4 JEVTANA-treated patients.
- PROSELICA trial (a noninferiority study comparing two doses of JEVTANA in a similar patient population) reported incidences of renal failure, including fatal cases.
- The CARD trial evaluated JEVTANA 25 mg/m2 with prednisone/prednisolone and primary prophylaxis with G-CSF. While the summary focuses on neutropenia and hypersensitivity reactions, renal adverse effects, including serious ones, were identified.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- Section 5.5: Renal failure, including fatal outcomes, reported in association with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, or obstructive uropathy during treatment with JEVTANA.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- Though not specifically mentioning acute kidney injury, renal and urinary disorders are listed among the post-market surveillance reports of adverse reactions, suggesting additional instances that may not have been captured in clinical trial data.

Given the explicit mention of renal failure, including fatal cases, in both clinical trial summaries and the Warnings and Precautions section, as well as postmarketing reports of renal and urinary disorders, there is evidence to support a relationship between acute kidney infamy and exposure to cabazitaxel. This relationship is sufficiently serious that it has warranted the inclusion of renal failure in warnings to prescribing physicians and patients.

[Reference: U.S. Food and Drug Administration's labeling for JEVTANA (cabazitaxel)]",NA
acute kidney injury,cabazitaxel,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of cabazitaxel (JEVTANA) can be found in the clinical trial data and labeling information.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**

1. TROPIC Trial (25 mg/m^2): The safety evaluation of JEVTANA in combination with prednisone in 371 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer showed that renal failure, including some cases with fatal outcomes, occurred in 4% of patients, indicating that AKI is a potential adverse reaction of cabazitaxel. Specifically, renal failure was reported among the fatal adverse reactions in JEVTANA-treated patients (4 cases of renal failure).

2. PROSELICA Trial (comparison of 25 mg/m^2 vs. 20 mg/m^2 doses): Deaths within 30 days of the last study drug dose were reported with some cases involving renal failure. Here, renal failure was included among the fatal adverse reactions in patients treated with JEVTANA. The report indicates that fatalities linked to renal failure occurred in both the 25 mg/m^2 and 20 mg/m^2 arms.

3. CARD Trial (25 mg/m^2 + primary prophylaxis with G-CSF): The safety evaluation did not explicitly list AKI as an observed severe adverse reaction. However, acute kidney injury was listed in the table of adverse reactions for ≥5% of patients, indicating that the condition is a determined adverse reaction to cabazitaxel in this study setup.

**Post-marketing Surveillance:**

Postmarketing experience cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical practice due to the nature of reporting and unknown sample size. However, postmarketing data include instances of interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, along with renal and urinary disorders such as radiation recall hemorrhagic cystitis. These reports may suggest an associated risk of kidney injury, though the data are less specific and detailed.

**Warnings and Precautions in Labeling:**

The drug label includes a warning for renal failure (under Section 5.5), which has been reported, including cases with fatal outcomes. The label explicitly states that renal failure has occurred in patients treated with JEVTANA, and advises identification of the cause and aggressive treatment. 

In summary, clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, in addition to explicit warnings on the drug label, support the relationship between AKI and exposure to cabazitaxel. The evidence from the clinical trials demonstrates occurrences of renal failure, including fatal outcomes, while post-marketing data and label warnings corroborate these findings and establish the need for monitoring and management of this potential adverse reaction during treatment with cabazitaxel.",NA
acute kidney injury,cabozantinib,,"Evidence for the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and cabozantinib exposure is not explicitly detailed within the sections provided from the drug label. The adverse reactions and warnings primarily list other known side effects and toxicities associated with cabozantinib, such as diarrhea, hypertension, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), hypocalcemia, hemorrhage, and osteonecrosis of the jaw, among others.

However, section 5.9 under Warnings and Precautions does mention that proteinuria was observed in 2% of patients receiving cabozantinib and that there was one case of a patient developing nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that causes the kidneys to excrete too much protein into the urine and can potentially lead to AKI. While proteinuria is not equivalent to AKI, it can be a sign of kidney injury or damage.

Since nephrotic syndrome and severe proteinuria are associated with kidney damage or dysfunction, they could possibly lead to or indicate underlying acute kidney injury. Nonetheless, due to the lack of direct reference to AKI, one cannot definitively state that there is evidence in clinical trials or post-marketing experience to support AKI as an adverse reaction to cabozantinib based solely on the provided label information.

To provide a comprehensive evaluation, a rigorous review of available clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports beyond the drug label would be necessary. If academic or clinical research articles have reported on AKI as a potential adverse reaction to cabozantinib following its administration, that evidence would be relevant but is not included in the sections of the drug label provided. Therefore, it is recommended to consult the scientific literature for any additional reports or case studies detailing AKJ in the context of cabozantinib treatment.",NA
acute kidney injury,cabozantinib,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction in the provided sections of the cabozantinib (CABOMETYX) drug label. The sections provided discuss various adverse reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and warnings/precautions related to cabozantinib, but there is no direct mention of AKI either in the adverse reactions or in the postmarketing experience.

In the clinical trial experiences detailed for renal cell carcinoma (METEOR, CABOSUN), hepatocellular carcinoma (CELESTIAL), and differentiated thyroid cancer (COSMIC-311), adverse reactions such as hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), and hepatotoxicity were among the most commonly reported, but AKI is not noted as a prominent adverse event. However, ""increased creatinine"" is mentioned in the laboratory abnormalities table under METEOR clinical trials with a 7% all grades incidence and <1% grade 3-4 incidence, which could suggest renal impairment in some patients.

Renal-related concerns that are listed include proteinuria and renal failure acute, as observed in the clinical trials detailed in tables. Specifically, CABOSUN reports that within 30 days of treatment, there was a patient who had acute renal failure.

Given this information, there may be a potential for cabozantinib to cause or contribute to renal impairment in some patients. However, the evidence does not point to a direct, widely recognized relationship between cabozantinib exposure and AKI as a common adverse reaction. Further investigation into individual patient cases, more detailed review of postmarketing surveillance data, and additional research would be required to conclusively determine if there is a causal relationship between cabozantinib treatment and AKI. 

As AKI is not clearly stated as an adverse event in the available evidence from clinical trials and labeling provided, it is important to monitor renal function in patients taking cabozantinib as recommended by standard clinical practice, especially given the mentions of related renal issues such as proteinuria and increased creatinine levels. Healthcare providers should also consider reporting suspected cases of AKI potentially associated with cabozantinib to appropriate pharmacovigilance systems to aid in the ongoing accumulation of safety data.",NA
acute kidney injury,canagliflozin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to canagliflozin, a medication used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, is not explicitly provided within the sections of the drug label provided. The label mentions various adverse reactions and warnings but does not list AKI as a common adverse effect.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The clinical trials detailed in the label primarily discuss the most common adverse reactions, including genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and increased urination. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned in the context of the pool of placebo-controlled trials or the active-controlled trials presented in the drug label sections provided.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
Under postmarketing experience, acute kidney injury is listed among additional adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of canagliflozin. As these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it’s often difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a direct causal relationship to drug exposure.

Warnings and Precautions:
The label mentions that canagliflozin may lead to intravascular volume contraction which can manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine, implying a potential impact on kidney function. Furthermore, there have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury which are likely related to volume depletion in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin.

In sum, while AKI is not reported as a common adverse reaction from the clinical trials reflected in the provided drug label sections, it is recognized in the post-marketing surveillance data and implied under the warnings for volume depletion-related events. To firmly establish a relationship between canagliflozin and AKI, further dedicated studies or case reviews would be helpful. However, the evidence from post-marketing surveillance warrants caution and monitoring for signs of AKI in patients taking canagliflozin.","NA
"
acute kidney injury,canagliflozin,,"Based on the information provided in the labels and sections cited, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a commonly observed adverse reaction in the controlled clinical trials for canagliflozin, nor do the sections you've provided list it under the adverse reactions or warnings and precautions associated with the drug.

The adverse reactions described in the label (section 6.1) include diabetic ketoacidosis, lower limb amputation, volume depletion, urosepsis and pyelonephritis, hypoglycemia with concomitant use with insulin and insulin secretagogues, necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), genital mycotic infections, hypersensitivity reactions, and bone fracture, but AKI is not explicitly listed.

However, the warning and precaution under section 5.3 does mention a risk of acute kidney injury which may relate to volume depletion. Post-marketing reports of AKI are noted, suggesting that evidence of this potential adverse reaction arises more from post-marketing surveillance and clinical practice rather than from pre-marketing clinical trials.

It's important to note that this summary pertains specifically to the label sections provided and focuses solely on evidence relating acute kidney injury to canagliflozin. Additional details about the frequency, risk factors, and management of AKI as a potential side effect of canagliflozin might be obtainable from other clinical studies, scientific literature, and detailed analysis of post-marketing surveillance data. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients for signs of AKI, particularly in those with risk factors, and manage as per clinical guidelines.","NA

The provided drug label sections do not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and canagliflozin exposure; however, they do not directly list acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction either. The ""Volume Depletion"" section under warnings and precautions does mention that canagliflozin could lead to intravascular volume contraction, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. This statement indirectly acknowledges that canagliflozin could affect kidney function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, especially in patients with predisposing factors such as impaired renal function, concomitant use of diuretics, or the elderly. Therefore, there is a recognized relationship between canagliflozin and conditions that could lead to acute kidney injury, although the evidence provided does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction in the clinical studies summarized."
acute kidney injury,candesartan,1.0,"The evidence suggesting that acute kidney injury (AKI) is an adverse reaction associated with the use of candesartan can be primarily inferred from sections 5.4 and 6.1 of the drug label which address impaired renal function and clinical studies experiences, respectively.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
Though acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned, the drug label indicates in section 5.4 (Impaired Renal Function) that changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, which includes candesartan. Furthermore, the CHARM program, a series of clinical trials involving heart failure patients, is referenced, indicating an increased incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g., creatinine increase) in patients treated with candesartan compared to those treated with placebo (12.5% vs. 6.3%). Moreover, abnormal renal function led to drug discontinuation in 6.3% of candesartan-treated patients as against 2.9% in placebo-treated patients.

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
Specific case studies detailing acute kidney injury related to candesartan were not provided in the drug label. However, section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) notes that adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of candesartan, but does not list acute kidney injury or impaired renal function among them. Due to the lack of explicit mentions, it is not possible to definitively assess the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure for acute kidney injury from post-marketing surveillance in this context.

Given the available information, while acute kidney injury is not expressly listed as a common adverse reaction, evidence from clinical trials does suggest a potential relationship between candesartan use and renal impairment, which can include acute kidney injury, particularly in patient populations at risk, such as those with heart failure. It is crucial for healthcare providers to monitor renal function in patients receiving candesartan and to consider modification or discontinuation of therapy if significant renal impairment is observed.","According to the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction related to candesartan. However, it does discuss ""abnormal renal function,"" which includes an increased creatinine level as an adverse event and potential clinical concern when using the drug, particularly in patients with heart failure or those at risk due to preexisting renal conditions or renal artery stenosis. 

In the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (section 5.4 of the drug label), it specifies that changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, which includes candesartan. This warning suggests that while the term ""acute kidney injury"" may not be explicitly used, there is an acknowledged risk of renal impairment including acute renal failure associated with its use.

For patients treated with candesartan for heart failure in the CHARM program, there was a reported incidence of abnormal renal function of 12.5% compared to 6.3% in the placebo group, with a 6.3% discontinuation rate due to renal adverse events compared to 2.9% with placebo. This further supports the existence of a relationship between candesartan and adverse renal effects.

Therefore, in summarizing the evidence, it cannot be conclusively stated that acute kidney injury is not an adverse reaction of candesartan as the documentation indicates a relationship between candesartan use and renal impairment, though AKI is not directly mentioned.

NA (Not Applicable) is not an appropriate response given the information provided in the drug label which implies a potential risk for renal adverse events such as acute kidney injury."
acute kidney injury,cangrelor,,"Based on the provided label sections for the drug cangrelor (marketed as KENGREAL), evidence of acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction from drug exposure comes from the clinical trial data reported within the labeling.

The adverse reactions section and non-bleeding adverse reactions subsection specifically mention decreased renal function. It reports that worsening renal function was observed in 3.2% of KENGREAL-treated patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) as compared to 1.4% of clopidogrel patients with severe renal impairment. This information is derived from clinical trials, with the comparison suggesting an association between cangrelor administration and a higher incidence of renal function decline in patients with already impaired renal function.

To summarize, clinical trial evidence indicates that cangrelor may be associated with a higher incidence of worsening renal function compared to clopidogrel in patients with severe renal impairment. However, the information provided does not specify that this worsening renal function qualifies as acute kidney injury. Nevertheless, renal function decline could be a spectrum that may include acute kidney injury, especially in patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment.

There is no additional information available from the provided sections about case studies or post-marketing surveillance explicitly mentioning acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to cangrelor. Therefore, the evidence of an association between cangrelor and acute kidney injury can only be inferred from the clinical trials data found in the drug labeling, which highlights an increased incidence of decreased renal function in a specific patient population.",NA
acute kidney injury,capecitabine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of capecitabine comes from post-marketing experience and the drug's warning and precautions. Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy medication used for the treatment of various cancers, including colorectal, breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancers.

In Section 5.6 of the capecitabine drug label, ""Renal Toxicity"" is identified as a concern. It states that serious renal failure, which can sometimes be fatal, can occur with capecitabine. There is an emphasis on monitoring renal function at baseline and as clinically indicated. Furthermore, it is recommended to optimize hydration before starting capecitabine, as dehydration may increase the risk of renal toxicity. Withholding or adjusting the dose of capecitabine is suggested based on the onset and severity of renal toxicity.

In the post-marketing experience detailed in Section 6.2, “acute renal failure secondary to dehydration including fatal outcome” has been identified. This highlights that kidney-related issues have been observed in patients taking capecitabine after its initial approval, based on reports received from healthcare providers and consumers.

No specific incidence rates or study data are provided regarding AKI in the drug label sections provided, indicating that while renal toxicity has been observed, it may not be a common or well-characterized adverse reaction, compared to other side effects such as diarrhea or hand-and-foot syndrome.

In conclusion, while the drug label includes renal toxicity as a potential concern and post-marketing reports include instances of acute renal failure, there are no detailed incidence rates from clinical trials found on the label. For individuals using capecitabine, it is important to monitor renal function and maintain proper hydration, and healthcare providers should be aware of the potential risks to manage and adjust treatment as needed.",NA
acute kidney injury,capmatinib,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in association with capmatinib use is mentioned in the clinical trial experience section of the drug label provided. The safety profile of capmatinib was evaluated in the GEOMETRY mono-1 trial, which involved patients taking capmatinib (TABRECTA) 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

According to the drug label, acute kidney injury, including renal failure, occurred in less than 10% of patients treated with TABRECTA. Although the exact percentage rate within this group is not specified, it indicates that several instances of AKI were observed during the trial. The evidence presented highlights that AKI is an identified adverse reaction but suggests that it may not be among the most common or severe reactions to capmatinib.

It's important to stress that clinical trials are controlled environments, so observed adverse reactions within a trial may not necessarily cover all possible reactions post-marketing. Therefore, post-marketing surveillance is crucial to detect less common or delayed adverse reactions.

The drug label does point out that any suspected adverse reactions should be reported to appropriate authorities, like Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation or the FDA. However, there is no explicit mention in the label sections you provided regarding post-marketing surveillance data specifically for acute kidney injury.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials (GEOMETRY mono-1) supports a relationship between capmatinib and acute kidney injury albeit as a less commonly observed adverse reaction. There is no additional specific evidence provided in your summary from post-marketing surveillance; therefore, surveillance data cannot be commented on. Health care professionals are encouraged to report adverse reactions to capture such evidence post-marketing.",NA
acute kidney injury,captopril,1.0,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction to Captopril:

Clinical Trials:
Within the scope of clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients taking captopril, about one in 100 patients developed proteinuria, indicating possible kidney involvement. Further, rates of renal insufficiency, renal failure, and other kidney-related issues such as nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency were reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients. Although the causal relationship to captopril use is uncertain, these findings suggest a potential for renal adverse reactions, including acute kidney injury.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Additional adverse effects related to kidney function have emerged since the drug was marketed, which include interstitial nephritis—a condition that can lead to acute kidney injury. Specific incidence rates or confirmation of a causal relationship to captripril exposure is challenging to determine in the post-marketing setting, but these reports are considered part of the overall evidence.

Warnings:
The drug label includes warnings about hyperkalemia, small increases in serum potassium, which may be indicative of renal impairment. Transient elevations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine, especially in patients who are volume or salt depleted or have renovascular hypertension, have been observed. Such changes can be reflective of reduced kidney function, including acute kidney injury. Additionally, there is a mention of the possibility of decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, which can also be associated with acute kidney injury.

Conclusion:
There is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that suggests an association between captopril usage and adverse renal effects, including acute kidney injury. While the relationship is not conclusively causal based on the available data, the occurrence of proteinuria, renal insufficiency, renal failure, and changes in serum creatinine or BUN in patients taking captopril indicates potential risk for kidney-related adverse reactions. Clinicians should monitor kidney function when prescribing captopril, particularly in patients with existing kidney disease, those who are volume or salt depleted, or patients with renovascular hypertension.","NA

The adverse reaction label of captopril explicitly lists renal complications, such as renal insufficiency, renal failure, and proteinuria, among possible adverse reactions to the drug. As such, there is no available evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and captopril exposure, given that acute kidney injury encompasses conditions like renal insufficiency and renal failure. The relationship between certain renal adverse reactions and captopril is recognized in the provided drug label information."
acute kidney injury,carbamazepine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction of carbamazepine. However, there are relevant indications of renal-related side effects. The Genitourinary System subsection within the Adverse Reactions section mentions ""acute urinary retention, oliguria with elevated blood pressure, azotemia, renal failure, and impotence."" Oliguria (reduced urine output) and azotemia (high levels of nitrogenous waste products in the blood) can be associated with AKI. The term ""renal failure"" mentioned in the adverse reactions could encompass acute kidney injury as well.

Additionally, the label states that ""albuminuria, glycosuria, elevated BUN [blood urea nitrogen], and microscopic deposits in the urine have also been reported."" Elevated BUN is another laboratory finding that can be associated with AKI.

The specific evidence linking carbamazepine to acute kidney injury could come from clinical trials, retrospective studies, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance reporting such adverse effects in patients receiving the medication. Such evidence has not been explicitly presented in the text provided, suggesting that if such a relationship exists, it may be rare or not well-documented in the context of this drug labeling information.

To specifically evaluate the evidence supporting the relationship between AKI and carbamazepine exposure, a more comprehensive review of the medical literature, including clinical studies and post-marketing cases, would be required. It is also important to thoroughly investigate renal function changes in patients taking carbamazepine through the detailed analysis of case reports and clinical studies that monitor renal parameters.

In conclusion, while the drug label does not directly list acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to carbamazepine, there is mention of related renal issues, suggesting that AKI could potentially occur. To confirm this potential relationship and provide a more comprehensive summary, additional consultation of research articles, clinical trials, and case studies beyond this label would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,carfilzomib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and carfilzomib (Kyprolis) includes data from clinical trials, as stated in the drug's label. Acute renal failure is explicitly mentioned in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2) of the label, and renal failure, including acute cases, was noted to have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis.

Clinical trial data, as documented in sections 6.1 of the label, report that acute renal failure has occurred in approximately 9% of patients treated with Kyprolis, sometimes with fatal outcomes. Notably, the risk of fatal renal failure was higher in patients who had a reduced estimated creatinine clearance at baseline.

In addition to these descriptive statistics and warnings, Section 5.2 of the label specifically instructs monitoring serum creatinine regularly due to reported cases of acute renal failure. This highlights that the relationship between AKI and carfilzomib has been recognized through clinical observation and experience, necessitating careful monitoring.

Case studies and post-marketing surveillance data are not explicitly cited in the provided text, but the label's mention of AKI across different sections, including Warnings and Precautions and Adverse Reactions, signifies that evidence of this adverse reaction has been observed sufficiently consistently to require official documentation and guideline adjustments for clinicians.

In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between AKI and carfilzomib exposure comes from clinical trial experiences that show acute renal failure occurrences. The label explicitly cautions about this risk and prescribes regular monitoring of serum creatinine levels, reflecting that AKI is a clinically significant adverse reaction associated with carfilzomib use. The precise studies from which these data were drawn are not specified, but the information provided in the label is typically derived from a compilation of clinical trial results and post-marketing reports, indicating a well-established relationship between carfilzomib and AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,carfilzomib,,"**Evidence Supporting the Relationship Between Acute Kidney Injury and Carfilzomib:**

The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the exposure to carfilzomib is grounded in clinical trials data, as well as the post-marketing experiences as outlined in the detailed drug label sections provided.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
- Acute renal failure has been reported in approximately 9% of patients receiving carfilzomib, which includes both monotherapy and combination therapy trials (Section 5.2).
- Acute renal failure was more frequently reported in patients with advanced relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received carfilzomib monotherapy, with a higher risk communicated for patients who had baseline reduced estimated creatinine clearance (Section 5.2).
- In the ASPIRE trial, which evaluated carfilzomib in combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd), serious adverse reactions were observed, and discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% in the KRd arm versus 30% in the Rd arm (Section 6.1).
- In clinical studies, deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of carfilzomib occurred in 30/598 (5%) patients receiving carfilzomib monotherapy, where renal disorders accounted for part of these fatal incidents (Section 6.2).
- The safety sections of the drug label detail the instructions to monitor for AKI, indicating that medical professionals should regularly measure serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance, which underscores the clinical significance of this adverse event (Section 5.2).

**Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
- There are mentions of cases of acute renal failure, including fatal outcomes, during post-marketing experience of carfilzomib use (Section 6.2).
- The label discusses that the drug has been identified to cause renal toxicity and guides clinicians to monitor renal function closely (Section 5.2).

Based on the clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance information available, there is a clear evidence to support the relationship between carfilzomib administration and the development of AKI. Healthcare providers are advised to monitor renal function closely and consider dose adjustments or discontinuation in case of renal toxicity.",NA
acute kidney injury,carmustine,,"The relationship between acute kidney injury and carmustine exposure is supported by several pieces of evidence primarily drawn from adverse reactions observed in clinical practice and reported in postmarketing surveillance, as there is a specific mention of ""nephrotoxicity"" such as ""progressive azotemia, decrease in kidney size, renal failure"" under section 6 (ADVERSE REACTIONS) of the drug label for carmustine.

Clinical Trials: The drug label does not explicitly detail the frequency or context under which acute kidney injury was observed in clinical trials, and no specific clinical trial data is provided about the incidence of acute kidney injury. Clinical trial data are essential to establish a causal link between drug exposure and adverse reactions; however, the drug label suggests that renal toxicity is among the most common adverse reactions.

Postmarketing Surveillance: The evidence from postmarketing reports is vital. Even though spontaneous reporting systems do not always allow for a reliable estimate of frequency or establish a causal relationship due to underreporting and other biases, the presence of nephrotoxicity in these reports implicates carmustine as a potential cause of acute kidney injury.

Warnings: While the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section (5) and the Boxed Warnings do not specifically mention acute kidney injury, they do describe significant effects on bone marrow and pulmonary function and suggest that other serious toxicities can occur, which could imply the need for vigilance concerning adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity.

In summary, evidence supporting the link between acute kidney injury and carmustine exposure includes reports of nephrotoxic effects such as progressive azotemia, decrease in kidney size, and renal failure observed in postmarketing surveillance and acknowledged in the drug label. However, a precise frequency and clear causal relationship through large-scale clinical trials are not provided in the information available. Thus, while there is evidence implicating carmustine in acute kidney injury, more detailed investigations could strengthen the understanding of this relationship. Healthcare providers should monitor renal function in patients receiving carmustine and consider these risks when prescribing and administering the drug.",NA
acute kidney injury,carvedilol,,"The information provided from the drug label does not explicitly state that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known adverse reaction associated with Carvedilol. Instead, the label mentions instances of increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which could suggest renal impairment, but not specifically AKI. Under section 6.1, BUN increased is listed as an adverse event occurring in more than 1% but less than or equal to 3% of patients.

In sections 5.8 and 5.11, renal function deterioration and special considerations for patients with renal insufficiency are discussed, indicating that carvedilol can have renal effects, especially in patients with predisposing factors for renal dysfunction. Although causality is not directly established with AKI, it is recommended that renal function be monitored during up-titration of carvedilol, and the medication be adjusted or discontinued if worsening of renal function occurs.

Postmarketing experience (section 6.2) also does not explicitly mention AKI as an adverse reaction identified during the post-approval use of Carvedilol.

Given this information:

- Clinical Trials (section 6.1): Increased BUN is reported as an adverse event, which may suggest changes in renal function, but no clear evidence of AKI.
- Warnings (sections 5.8 and 5.11): Mention the deterioration of renal function and the need to monitor kidney health, particularly in at-risk populations.
- Postmarketing Surveillance (section 6.2): Does not list AKI as an identified adverse reaction.

Therefore, while there is some evidence that carvedilol can affect renal function and needs to be used with caution in patients with compromised renal health or those at risk of renal dysfunction, acute kidney injury is not listed as a specific adverse reaction in the provided sections of the drug label. Clinical vigilance is advised when prescribing carvedilol, especially in patients with existing renal impairment or those with cardiovascular conditions that predispose them to kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,caspofungin,,"Based on the provided drug label information for caspofungin (CANCIDAS), there is no direct mention or clearly established evidence of acute kidney injury being a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial dataset. The drug label extensively details adverse reactions and hepatic effects witnessed in clinical trials for adult and pediatric populations, as well as post-marketing experience.

In clinical trials, a broad range of adverse reactions were reported, most frequently involving the gastrointestinal system, general disorders, investigations (which include liver enzyme increases), and infection-related issues. No explicit mention of acute kidney injury is found in the adverse reactions (Section 6) or in the warnings and precautions (Section 5) related to Renal and urinary disorders. However, renal function was monitored and evaluated during the trials, and it was noted that caspofungin had a significantly lower incidence of nephrotoxicity compared to amphotericin B. In the empirical therapy study for presumed fungal infections in febrile neutropenic patients, the incidence was 3% for caspofungin versus 12% for amphotericin B among patients with a baseline creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min.

The postmarketing experience (Section 6.2) section mentions ""clinically significant renal dysfunction"" among reported adverse reactions, but because these reactions are voluntarily reported and without consistent follow-up, establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is challenging.

To summarize, the provided sections of caspofungin's drug label do not appear to support a strong evidence-based relationship between caspofungin and acute kidney injury specifically. The reduced incidence of nephrotoxicity in comparison to amphotericin B suggests that caspofungin is generally less harmful to the kidneys than at least some alternative antifungal therapies. However, since ""clinically significant renal dysfunction"" was noted as a postmarketing observation, it is theoretically possible that caspofungin could be associated with kidney-related side effects in certain vulnerable individuals or under particular circumstances. Healthcare providers are encouraged to monitor renal function as appropriate. Further investigation and research may be necessary to clarify the relationship between caspofungin and acute kidney injury.

For a definitive assessment, it would be advisable to consult research literature, case studies, and more in-depth postmarketing data if available.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefaclor,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cefaclor, there is information about reversible interstitial nephritis being a rare adverse effect related to therapy. Specifically, it is listed under ""Other effects considered related to therapy,"" which indicates that there is at least some level of evidence to suggest that cefaclor exposure can lead to nephrotoxicity in rare cases. Furthermore, reversible interstitial nephritis is a condition that can precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI).

Moreover, the drug label mentions ""renal dysfunction"" and ""toxic nephropathy"" as adverse reactions reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics generally. While cefaclor is a member of this broad class of antibiotics, the label does not directly link these specific adverse reactions with cefaclor.

Additionally, under the ""Renal"" subsection of causal relationship uncertain adverse reactions, the drug label indicates slight elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine, and abnormal urinalysis in a very small percentage of patients. These findings can be associated with renal impairment but do not directly indicate acute kidney injury.

The label does not provide evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specific to acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction of cefaclor. However, given that the label does include reversible interstitial nephritis and mentions renal adverse effects common to the cephalosporin class, there is an implication that there may be a potential, albeit rare, risk of acute kidney injury with cefaclor use. It is important to note that a causal link is not established, and the evidence stems from adverse reactions reported that are somehow related to cefaclor therapy without clear causality.

Regarding acute kidney injury directly, the label does not provide sufficient data, and if further detailed information or studies are required to specifically establish or refute this connection, it would be necessary to conduct a thorough literature search beyond the drug label. As of the information provided, there are no detailed clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing data presented in the label explicitly linking acute kidney injury to cefaclor exposure.","Based on the provided drug label sections for cefaclor, evidence specifically refuting acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction is not directly present. However, the label does mention ""reversible interstitial nephritis"" as a rare adverse effect and ""slight elevations in BUN or serum creatinine"" as an even less common occurrence, underlining that some kidney-related effects can occur but appear to be very infrequent and reversible.

Though acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed, it is possible it could be encompassed under more general terms such as ""renal dysfunction"" or ""toxic nephropathy,"" which are mentioned as adverse reactions for the cephalosporin class of antibiotics to which cefaclor belongs. However, ""renal dysfunction"" isn't extensively defined in this section, and it isn't clear whether AKI is included under this term based on the label alone.

It is necessary to clarify that the absence of explicit mention of AKI in the drug label does not necessarily mean that cefaclor has been refuted as a cause of this condition; it could also indicate a lack of reported evidence up to the point of the label's publication or a perceived lack of a direct causal association strong enough to warrant specific inclusion.

For conclusive evidence either supporting or refuting the relationship between cefaclor and acute kidney injury, further studies and clinical data would be required, which are not provided in the drug label. In the absence of such specific evidence, it cannot be conclusively stated that there is evidence refuting the relationship between AKI and cefaclor exposure."
acute kidney injury,cefadroxil,,"The drug label information provided does not explicitly state that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known adverse reaction specifically for cefadroxil. However, it mentions ""renal dysfunction"" and ""toxic nephropathy"" as adverse reactions observed in the class of antibiotics that cefadroxil belongs to, which are cephalosporins. The label further notes ""increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen)"" and ""increased creatinine,"" which are laboratory indicators frequently associated with renal impairment including AKI.

As for clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, the drug label does not provide specific incidences or studies relating to cefadroxil and AKI, but it does mention both general and serious adverse reactions that have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics. Since cefadroxil is part of this class, one might infer that AKI could potentially occur, but the label does not directly link AKI to cefadroxil.

The warnings provided in the label do not include a boxed warning specific to cefadroxil and AKI, which suggests that if AKI is a potential adverse reaction, it may not be one of the most severe or prevalent concerns associated with cefadroxil compared to other reactions such as anaphylaxis or seizures in patients with renal impairment.

In summary, while the drug label for cefadroxil includes renal-related adverse events as part of the larger cephalosporin antibiotic class, it does not specifically cite acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction for cefadroxil based on the information provided. To arrive at a more precise assessment of the risk of AKI with cefadroxil, one would need to review data from clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing experiences that are specific to cefadroxil, if such data exists. It is also crucial to monitor renal function in patients receiving cephalosporins, especially in those with pre-existing renal impairment, and adjust doses accordingly.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefazolin,,"Based on the adverse reactions section of the drug label for cefazolin, it is explicitly stated that renal-related adverse effects, including increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as renal failure, have been reported with the use of this cephalosporin antibiotic. Although the label does not explicitly mention ""acute kidney injury"" (AKI) by that name, the reference to renal failure and increased BUN and creatinine is indicative of possible kidney impairment, which can encompass AKI.

To summarize the available evidence supporting the relationship between AKI and cefazolin exposure:

1. Case Studies: In clinical practice, case studies have reported instances of AKI in patients receiving cefazolin. However, the summary does not provide specific references to these case studies, and they should be reviewed individually for details such as patient characteristics, dosage, duration of therapy, and concurrent medical conditions that could influence the development of AKI.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance: The drug label indicates that reports of renal failure have been received post-marketing, which suggests that observational data collected after the drug's release into the market have noted AKI as an adverse event. These reports are a form of pharmacovigilance and can provide real-world evidence of adverse reactions.

3. Clinical Trials: The summary does not provide specific data from clinical trials regarding the incidence of AKI in patients receiving cefazolin. Therefore, it is unclear whether AKI has been observed as an adverse reaction in the controlled settings of clinical trials for cefazolin.

The drug label's mention of renal failure as an adverse reaction post-marketing, coupled with increased BUN and creatinine levels, provides evidence to suggest that cefazinetreatments.prilin has the potential to cause renal impairment, including AKI. For healthcare providers and patients, this indicates that renal function should be monitored in patients receiving cefazolin, especially in those with preexisting renal compromise or when used in high doses.

Direct evidence from controlled clinical trials would further clarify the relationship between cefazolin and AKI, but such data is not provided in this summary. Therefore, the relationship can be considered plausible based on the available post-marketing data, but more detailed research and systematic reviews would be needed for a comprehensive assessment. Information pertaining to this relationship would be documented in medical literature and databases which hold compiled reports of adverse drug reactions.","NA
"
acute kidney injury,cefdinir,,"Based on the provided drug label information for cefdinir, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, there is evidence of altered laboratory tests that could suggest renal involvement in adult and pediatric patients, although acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as a common adverse event.

In the adverse events section for adult and adolescent patients, an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels was observed in 0.3% of patients treated with cefdinir capsules in U.S. trials. BUN elevation can be indicative of impaired kidney function, which may signal acute kidney injury, but the data provided does not detail the clinical significance or context of these findings, such as whether there was an accompanying increase in creatinine levels or a decrease in urine output, which are important diagnostic criteria for AKI.

The pediatric trials reported a 1% incidence of increased urine protein in patients treated with cefdinir suspension. Proteinuria can be associated with kidney dysfunction, but by itself does not confirm AKI and could result from a variety of renal and non-renal causes.

During post-marketing experience, acute renal failure—which encompasses AKI—is listed among the adverse experiences reported. However, the frequency, causality, and specifics of these reports are not provided. Post-marketing surveillance data can be valuable as it represents a larger and more diverse population compared to clinical trials, but such reports are often limited by underreporting, lack of a control group, and variable quality of evidence.

It is important to note that the overall evidence does not establish a direct, definite causal relationship between cefdinir and acute kidney injury based on the ingredient labeling information alone. While there are adverse events and laboratory changes that could be related to kidney function, the evidence is not robust enough to conclusively link cefdinir to AKI without further clinical context and analysis.

For a definitive evaluation, one would seek data from peer-reviewed studies, robust clinical databases, or detailed case reports further examining this potential relationship, considering confounding factors and patient-specific variables such as underlying renal disease, concomitant medications, and the severity of infection being treated. If such detailed evidence was available, it would need to be reviewed to provide more precise information on the relationship between cefdinir exposure and the risk of acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefditoren,,"Regarding the relationship between cefditoren use and acute kidney injury, the evidence can be derived from post-market surveillance as mentioned in your provided text. Specifically, acute renal failure is listed under the section detailing adverse events reported during extensive post-marketing experience beginning with approval in Japan in 1994.

However, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse event or warning in the provided clinical trial data for the recommended doses of cefditoren pivoxil in both the adult and adolescent population (≥12 years of age) or in the standard warnings and adverse reactions sections for cephalosporin class antibiotics.

The clinical trials section highlights adverse events such as gastrointestinal disturbances (with diarrhea and nausea being the most common, leading to discontinuation in some cases), changes in laboratory parameters (hematuria, increase in urine white blood cells, changes in hematocrit and glucose levels), and other less common adverse events.

The cephalosporin class adverse reaction section also mentions renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy, which indicates that kidney-related adverse effects are known within this class of drugs, and by extrapolation, cefditoren could share these risks.

In conclusion, while acute kidney injury is not highlighted as a common adverse event in the clinical trials data for cefditoren, it has been reported during post-marketing surveillance, suggesting an association between cefditoren use and acute kidney injury. However, the exact incidence and strength of this relationship are not described in detail in the provided information, and further investigation into the post-marketing data and potential case studies or clinical evaluations would be required for a more comprehensive risk assessment.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefepime,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial data or reported as a specific adverse reaction in the post-marketing experience of patients treated with cefepime. Consequently, the evidence in the label does not explicitly support a relationship between cefepime exposure and the occurrence of acute kidney injury.

However, acute kidney injury has been associated with the cephalosporin class of antibiotics as described under section 6.3 ""Cephalosporin-Class Adverse Reactions"" which includes ""renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy"" among other systemic adverse events. This suggests a class effect that could potentially include cefepime, but specific evidence implicating cefepime is not provided in the drug label sections shared.

Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):
The clinical trials discussed in the drug label, which involved 4,137 patients treated with cefepime, do not report acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. The adverse events documented at a higher frequency included local reactions, positive Coombs’ test, changes in liver enzymes, coagulation times, and rash.

Postmarketing Experience (6.2):
The postmarketing experience of cefepime has identified adverse reactions such as encephalopathy, seizures, and blood dyscrasias, but there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury in the section provided.

Cephalosporin-Class Adverse Reactions (6.3):
The drug label mentions a range of adverse reactions associated with cephalosporin antibiotics as a class, including renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy, which may imply the risk of AKI. However, without direct evidence from clinical trials or reported cases specifically related to cefepime, the relationship between cefepime and AKI cannot be definitively established.

Warnings and Precautions:
The sections provided focus on hypersensitivity reactions, neurotoxicity, and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. There is a mention of renal impairment in the context of neurotoxicity, where patients with compromised renal function are noted to be at risk of neurotoxicity if the dosing is not properly adjusted.

In summary, the provided label information lacks explicit evidence supporting a direct relationship between cefepime exposure and acute kidney injury. While renal dysfunction is recognized as a potential adverse reaction within the general class of cephalosporins, more specific evidence would be needed to establish a causal link between cefepime use and the incidence of acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefixime,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to cefixime can be deduced from the drug label itself, specifically in Section 6.2 Post-marketing Experience, which lists ""acute renal failure"" as a reported adverse reaction following the post-approval use of cefixite. While incidence rates for this adverse reaction are not specified beyond being less than 1 in 50 (less than 2%), the inclusion of acute renal failure in the post-marketing surveillance data points to the existence of cases where cefixime exposure has been temporally associated with AKI.

Although ""transient elevations in BUN or creatinine"" are mentioned, which can be markers for renal impairment, the label does not provide specific details about the studies or patient cases from which these data were derived. Hence, while there is a signal suggesting an association between AKI and cefixime use in the post-marketing setting, the label lacks detailed evidence from clinical trials or specific case studies that can quantify the risk or characterize the nature of this relationship more precisely.

It is important to consider that post-marketing surveillance data have limitations, as they often include voluntary reporting with variable levels of detail and confirmation. The absence of solid evidence from clinical trials could suggest that acute kidney injury is a rare and potentially under-recognized adverse reaction of cefixime. Therefore, while the label provides some evidence of a potential relationship between AKI and cefixime, the lack of robust clinical trial data or detailed case reports suggests that further investigation might be necessary to establish a causal relationship and better understand the risk factors and mechanisms involved.

Overall, prescribing physicians should be aware of this potential adverse reaction and monitor renal function in patients taking cefixime, especially in those with preexisting renal impairment, as advised in Section 5.3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment. Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of renal dysfunction promptly.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefotaxime,,"Based on the drug label provided for cefotaxime, evidence supporting the relationship between the development of acute kidney injury and drug exposure can be summarized as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed among the most frequent or less frequent adverse reactions during cefotaxime clinical trials.
   - Other kidney-related issues reported include transient elevations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), mentioned under less frequent adverse reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients.

2. Post-Marketing Experience:
   - After the approval and widespread use of cefotaxime, certain adverse kidney reactions have been reported. These are based on voluntary reports and thus, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a strong causal relationship to drug exposure.
   - Specifically mentioned are interstitial nephritis, transient elevations of creatinine, and acute renal failure. Interstitial nephritis can be associated with acute kidney injury, and instances of acute renal failure indicate a more severe form of kidney injury following the administration of cefotaxime.

3. Warnings and General Information:
   - The drug label mentions that, as with other cephalosporins, cefotaxime should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. It is advised that the dosage should be adjusted in renal impairment to prevent the accumulation of cefotaxime and the potential risk of toxicity, such as encephalopathy, which can occur with high doses of beta-lactam antibiotics and might be indirectly indicative of renal distress.
   - Although not directly stated in the sections provided, it is generally known that cephalosporins, including cefotaxime, have potential nephrotoxicity, particularly when administered in high doses or when renal function is already compromised, necessitating careful monitoring of kidney function during therapy.

In conclusion, while acute kidney injury is not frequently reported in controlled clinical trials of cefotaxime, there is post-marketing evidence of kidney-related adverse reactions, including interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. These findings from post-marketing surveillance suggest a potential relationship between cefotaxime exposure and acute kidney injury; however, establishing a definitive causal link requires further investigation, and the actual frequency of such adverse reactions is not well-defined due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports.

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. or the FDA as provided on the drug label. Additionally, healthcare providers should closely monitor renal function during cefotaxime treatment, especially in patients with known renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefotetan,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, the relationship between acute kidney injury and cefotetan exposure includes the following evidence:

Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Experience:
- Renal: The drug label indicates that elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine have been reported, which are markers of kidney function and can suggest acute kidney injury.
- Urogenital: Nephrotoxicity has rarely been reported in association with cefotetan. This indicates a potential for kidney damage that could manifest as acute kidney injury.
- Cephalosporin-Class Antibiotics: While not specific to cefotetan, the drug label also lists renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy as potential adverse reactions for cephalosporin-class antibiotics. Given cefotetan is a member of this class, this suggests a class effect where nephrotoxicity could be a potential issue.

The drug label does not detail specific incidences or the frequency of acute kidney injury in relation to cefotetan administration, nor does it provide specific data from clinical trials regarding acute kidney injury. However, it does acknowledge renal complications as a possibility both in general terms related to cephalosporins, and specifically with cefotetan through postmarketing adverse reaction reporting.

It should be noted that postmarketing surveillance is a type of observational data and can provide initial signals about potential adverse drug reactions, but it does not establish causality. The reported cases could be influenced by various factors, including concomitant medications, underlying medical conditions, and patient characteristics.

To further establish the relationship between acute kidney injury and cefotetan, additional studies such as prospective clinical trials or retrospective analyses would be necessary to clarify the incidence, causality, and risk factors associated with this potential adverse reaction.

In summary, while elevations in BUN and serum creatinine and rare reports of nephrotoxicity associated with cefotetan have been reported, which could suggest an association with acute kidney injury, specific evidence from clinical trials regarding this adverse reaction is not detailed in the provided drug label. Adverse reaction reports from postmarketing surveillance do suggest a potential relationship, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish a definitive causal link. Additional research would be required to provide more conclusive evidence.

To report suspected adverse reactions associated with cefotetan, healthcare professionals and consumers can contact Fresenius Kabi, USA LLC or the FDA as detailed in the drug label.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefoxitin,,"The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to cefoxitin can be summarized based on the drug label sections provided. According to the renal function section of the adverse reactions segment, elevations in serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen levels have been observed in patients treated with Cefoxitin for Injection, which may indicate renal impairment. The drug label states that acute renal failure has been reported rarely with cefoxitin. However, it is important to note that the role of Cefoxitin for Injection in these changes is difficult to assess, given that pre-existing conditions predisposing to prerenal azotemia (a form of kidney dysfunction) or to impaired renal function were typically present.

Furthermore, the label mentions that toxic nephropathy has been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics, to which cefoxitin belongs. However, specific data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance linking cefoxitin to AKI is not provided in the sections cited.

Based on this information, there is an acknowledgement of a possible association between cefoxitin exposure and AKI, but the evidence appears to be rare and confounded by other factors that might predispose individuals to renal dysfunction. To fully establish a causal relationship, more detailed examinations of case reports, epidemiological studies, and mechanistic research would be necessary. Without such data, it can only be suggested that there is a potential risk of AKI with cefoxitin use, and healthcare providers should monitor renal function when prescribing this medication, especially in patients with pre-existing renal conditions or other risk factors for renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefpodoxime,,"There is currently no direct evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking cefpodoxime exposure to acute kidney injury (AKI) provided in the provided drug label sections. Here are the key points addressing the subject:

Clinical Trials:
- In clinical trials involving multiple doses of cefpodoxime proxetil, with a total of 4696 patients treated, and an additional 2128 pediatric patients treated with oral suspension, there was no mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse event.
- Renal-related adverse events reported in less than 1% of the patients included increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, which are markers that may be associated with renal impairment but are not specifically indicative of AKI.

Post-marketing Experience:
- The post-marketing experience section lists ""purpuric nephritis"" as a serious adverse experience. This condition can involve kidney injury, but it is distinct from AKI and typically refers to a type of allergic reaction affecting the kidneys.
- The section also mentions ""Renal dysfunction"" as a cephalosporin class adverse reaction but does not specify whether this includes AKI.

Warnings:
- The drug label provides warnings about the risk of pseudomembranous colitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and other serious adverse reactions, but AKI is not directly mentioned.
- Under the category of abnormal laboratory tests for cephalosporin class antibiotics, ""renal dysfunction"" and ""toxic nephropathy"" are mentioned, which can be related to kidney problems. However, these terms are broad and do not confirm AKI specifically.

In conclusion, although there is no specific evidence from the provided drug label sections that acute kidney injury is a documented adverse reaction to cefpodoxime, slight indicators of potential kidney-related issues (increased BUN and creatinine, purpuric nephritis, and general renal dysfunction) have been noted. Nevertheless, these findings are insufficient to establish a definitive relationship between cefpodoxime and AKI. Additional clinical studies and reports would be necessary to determine such a link. If more detailed information or recent data are required, reviewing additional sources such as peer-reviewed journals, case reports, and more recent post-marketing surveillance data is recommended.",NA
acute kidney injury,cefprozil,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, evidence suggests that acute kidney injury has been associated, although rarely, with the use of cefprozil.

Clinical Trials:
The sections of the drug label pertaining to clinical trials do not explicitly mention acute kidney injury as a common reaction to cefprozil. Renal adverse events reported during the controlled clinical trials include elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, both of which occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. These indicators can be associated with renal impairment but do not directly establish acute kidney injury.

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label indicates that during post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare reports of adverse events without a clearly established causal relationship to cefprozil. The list of adverse effects mentions general ""renal dysfunction,"" which can encompass a range of renal issues, including potentially acute kidney injury. However, specific cases or details of acute kidney injury are not provided in the label sections provided.

Cephalosporin Class Warning:
The label notes that ""toxic nephropathy,"" a form of kidney damage, has been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics, which includes cefprozil. However, this warning applies to the drug class as a whole and does not quantify the risk for cefprozil specifically.

In summary, while the evidence of a relationship between cefprozil and acute kidney injury does not appear to be strong or well-characterized, there is an indication that renal dysfunction, including potential kidney injury, is a known, albeit rare, adverse reaction to cephalosporin antibiotics, thus including cefprozil by class association. The specific association of cefprozil with acute kidney injury would require further clinical data or case reports for a more definitive conclusion. Given the available information, it is recommended to monitor renal function when prescribing cependants that may be at increased risk, such as those with preexisting kidney conditions or those taking other nephrotoxic drugs.","Based on the provided drug label information, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a known adverse reaction directly associated with cefprozil. Renal-related adverse effects listed include elevated BUN and serum creatinine levels, which are indicators of renal function but do not by themselves confirm AKI. These renal effects are reported at a very low frequency (0.1%). Additionally, other serious renal adverse reactions, such as toxic nephropathy, are mentioned among cephalosporin-class antibiotics in general, not cefprozil specifically.

However, the absence of acute kidney injury in the provided adverse reactions does not categorically refute its potential occurrence. The label mentions that renal dysfunction is a reported adverse reaction to cephalosporin antibiotics as a class, which implies a potential for such events, albeit rare or dose-related, possibly when the recommended dosage is exceeded or when other risk factors for AKI are present.

Given that the available information from the drug label does not confirm nor strongly refute the relationship between AKI and cefprozil use, and no specific evidence refuting the relationship between AKI and cefprozil use is provided, a comprehensive literature search and an investigation into clinical data repositories and post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary to form a more conclusive opinion. As no concrete refuting evidence is provided here, it is appropriate to advise monitoring renal function when using cefprozil, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or other risk factors for kidney injury.

In summary, the provided label information does not specifically refute the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to cefprozil, nor does it provide any direct evidence to support refutation. Therefore, the relationship between AKI and cefprozil cannot be conclusively dismissed based on the provided text. Additional evidence from other sources would be required to fully assess this potential relationship."
acute kidney injury,ceftaroline fosamil,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ceftaroline fosamil (Teflaro), there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in either the clinical trials or postmarketing experience sections. The adverse reactions listed are primarily related to gastrointestinal issues (like diarrhea and nausea), hypersensitivity reactions, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, neurological adverse reactions like encephalopathy and seizures, blood disorders like direct Coombs' test seroconversion, and potential development of drug-resistant bacteria.

In the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1) for ceftaroline fosamil, renal and urinary disorders were mentioned, specifically renal failure, although the incidence was less than 2% among adult patients. It's important to note that in medical terminology, ""renal failure"" can encompass a range of kidney issues, including acute kidney injury. However, without specific data on the incidence of AKI, it's unclear how prevalent this concern is or whether it was a notable issue during the trials.

Furthermore, the Warnings and Precautions (Section 5) mention that neurological adverse reactions were most likely to occur in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustments. While this does not specifically address AKI, it implies that kidney function is a consideration when administering ceftaroline fosamil, particularly to individuals with existing renal issues.

In the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), while there are a range of adverse reactions reported, none specifically identify AKI.

In conclusion, the evidence from the information provided does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction to ceftaroline fosamil. There is a mention of renal failure in less than 2% of the adult population, but without specific details on AKI, one cannot establish a clear relationship based on the available label information. As always, healthcare providers should monitor renal function during ceftaroline fosamil treatment, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as a matter of good clinical practice.",NA
acute kidney injury,ceftaroline fosamil,,"The provided drug label for ceftaroline fosamil, known by its trade name Teflaro, does not list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction. The sections of the label mention diarrhea, nausea, and rash as the most frequent reactions in clinical trials. Serious adverse reactions and those leading to treatment discontinuation include hypersensitivity and neurological adverse reactions. The ""Renal and urinary disorders"" category does mention ""renal failure"" in the section describing other adverse reactions observed during clinical trials, with incidences less than 2%, which may encompass AKI.

Post-marketing experience, as mentioned in section 6.2, does not specifically cite AKI, but since post-marketing surveillance involves voluntary reporting of adverse reactions from a population of uncertain size, the absence of AKI here does not definitively rule out its potential occurrence.

In terms of sources:

- Clinical Trials (Section 6.1): The label indicates that renal failure, which could include AKI, was observed with an incidence of less than 2% in adult patients who received Teflaro during clinical trials. However, specific details on AKI are not provided. 
- Post-marketing Surveillance (Section 6.2): The label does not report AKI as a post-marketing adverse event.

Thus, there is a mention of ""renal failure"" which may potentially include AKI, in clinical trials involving adult patients, but the evidence does not appear to be prominent or clearly distinguished from other forms of kidney damage. The post-marketing data available in the provided label does not provide any information on AKI specifically. 

More detailed information on the incidence, onset, and possible risk factors of AKI related to ceftaroline fosamil would typically be expected to come from peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or more detailed analysis of post-marketing data beyond what is included in the drug label. To fully determine the relationship between AKI and ceftaroline fosamil, one would need to consult such studies or databases that contain more granular data or that have conducted specific analyses concerning this adverse event. To the best of the information provided in the label, evidence is not robust nor specifically focused on AKI as an adverse reaction to ceftaroline fosamil.",NA
acute kidney injury,ceftazidime,,"The evidence included in the drug label for ceftazidime does not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction. However, the label does note that transient elevations of blood urea, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and/or serum creatinine were occasionally observed in clinical trials. These laboratory test changes can be indicative of kidney dysfunction, as they reflect a decrease in kidney filtration ability, which is a key component of AKI. Nonetheless, these occurrences are described as transient, suggesting that the effects were temporary and possibly reversible when ceftazidime administration ceased or the dosage was adjusted.

The label also mentions reports of encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia in renally impaired patients treated with unadjusted dosing regimens of ceftazidime. These neurological adverse events have been observed in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, who require dose adjustments to prevent ceftazidime accumulation and potential toxicity.

While the evidence from clinical trials, as mentioned in the label, demonstrates that there were some effects on renal markers, the information provided does not contain data that directly correlates ceftazidime with a significant risk of AKI. Additionally, no specific data from case studies or post-marketing surveillance are cited in the drug label concerning AKI.

However, it is a known fact that cephalosporins, the class of antibiotics to which ceftazidime belongs, have been associated with nephrotoxicity in certain situations, particularly when administered in high doses, in patients with existing renal impairment, or when used concomitantly with other nephrotoxic drugs.

Based on the available label information, there is no strong evidence directly linking ceftazidime with acute kidney injury as a frequent or well-characterized adverse reaction. The described transient changes in renal laboratory tests suggest that renal function should be monitored during ceftazidime therapy, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving high doses. If there is additional published literature outside the drug label, it would be required to further evaluate the relationship between ceftazidime and AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,ceftibuten,,"Based on the provided drug label information for ceftibuten (marketed as CEDAX), there is no direct reported evidence in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data that explicitly establishes acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to ceftibuten. However, changes in laboratory values that could be indicative of renal dysfunction have been observed.

From the available data:

1. **Clinical Trials**:
   - In adult patients, there was a reported incidence equal to or greater than 1% of increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which was 4%. This could potentially imply renal stress or dysfunction since BUN is a marker commonly used to evaluate kidney function.
   - In pediatric patients, there was a 2% incidence of increased BUN.

2. **Post-marketing Surveillance**:
   - There have been isolated adverse experiences reported worldwide, such as renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy, which are conditions related to kidney injury; however, these are listed under general cephalosporin-class adverse reactions and are not specifically attributed to ceftibuten.

3. **Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions**:
   - It is noted that renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy are adverse reactions for the cephalosporin class of antibiotics, and since ceftibuten belongs to this class, there could be potential concerns regarding kidney injury related to its use.

Given the absence of a direct mention of AKI as an adverse reaction to ceftibuten in the provided label sections, there is no concrete evidence that AKI is a commonly reported or established complication directly attributable to ceftibuten. Yet, the observed alterations in BUN and the mention of renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy within the broader cephalosporin class suggest that monitoring of renal function might be prudent when using ceftibuten, especially in predisposed individuals or those with pre-existing renal impairment.

In summary, there is an implication based on laboratory changes and the known profile of cephalosporins that ceftibuten could potentially affect renal function, but there is no explicit evidence in the label information that AKI is a recognized adverse reaction specific to ceftibuten. Careful monitoring of patients with known renal insufficiency might be warranted when prescribing this drug.",NA
acute kidney injury,ceftriaxone,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there are indications that ceftriaxone can be associated with renal adverse events, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Here is a summary of the evidence related to AKI as an adverse reaction to ceftriaxone:

1. Post-Marketing Experience:
   The label notes that in the post-marketing surveillance, there have been reports of oliguria, ureteric obstruction, and post-renal acute renal failure. Although data are generally insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation, these reports suggest a potential association with ceftriaxone administration.

2. Laboratory Findings in Clinical Trials:
   Elevations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were reported in 1.2% of patients, and increased creatinine levels were noted in 0.6% of patients in clinical trials. These findings can be indicative of renal impairment, which could be related to acute kidney injury.

3. Drug Label Warnings:
   While acute kidney injury is not explicitly stated as a common adverse reaction, the label includes general warnings about the class of cephalosporins to which ceftriaxone belongs. It states that allergic reactions, renal dysfunction, and toxic nephropathy have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics.

4. Case Reports and Literature:
   Additional evidence, such as isolated case studies or literature reviews, though not directly provided in the drug label text, could provide more detailed information regarding the frequency and circumstances of AKI following ceftriaxone use. Clinicians may encounter case reports where AKI is observed in association with ceftriaxone, but these are not mentioned in the label provided.

5. Mechanism of Injury:
   The label does not detail the actual mechanism by which ceftriaxone could cause acute kidney injury. However, the possibility of renal precipitation may suggest a mechanism, as crystalline material in the kidneys, observed at autopsy in some neonatal fatalities, could suggest the propensity for ceftriaxone to precipitate under certain conditions, potentially leading to AKI.

In summary, while the label mentions the possibility of post-renal acute renal failure in post-marketing reports and notes renal-related laboratory changes in clinical trials, it does not explicitly state that acute kidney injury is a common or well-defined adverse reaction to ceftriaxone. However, the evidence suggests that there may be a potential link, and further investigation, such as controlled studies, could be warranted to clarify this relationship.

To obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of AKI attributed to ceftriaxone, it would be necessary to analyze data from larger population studies, clinical trial databases, systematic reviews, and pharmacovigilance data sources, with a focus on renal-related adverse effects.","As requested, I will focus on evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and ceftriaxone exposure. Based on the provided drug label information, while there are mentions of renal-related adverse reactions such as increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased creatinine, the presence of casts in urine, and oliguria, the incidence of these events is infrequent and does not include acute kidney injury as a common or well-characterized adverse effect.

Additionally, the label notes isolated cases of post-renal acute renal failure due to ureteric obstruction, which could be associated with the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium salt precipitates. However, these are rare occurrences and the data appear insufficient to establish a general causation between ceftriaxone and AKI.

Thus, the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience included in the drug label does not support a direct, well-established link between ceftriaxone and the development of acute kidney injury in general patient populations. The occurrences of renal-related adverse effects are noted to be less than 1%, suggesting that if there is a risk, it is very low.

In summary, based on the information from the drug label, there is no strong evidence to suggest acute kidney injury is a common or characteristic adverse reaction to ceftriaxone. However, since information provided in drug labels can sometimes be nonexhaustive, and the capacity of the drug to precipitate in the renal system has been partially observed as a rare complication, this conclusion is based on available data and does not rule out the potential for future findings to modify this understanding. It is important to note that individual susceptibilities and comorbid conditions may play a significant role in adverse reactions, and healthcare providers should monitor renal function during ceftriaxone therapy as with any antibiotic use, especially in those with pre-existing renal impairment or concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs."
acute kidney injury,cefuroxime,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to cefuroxime axetil is not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections. AKI is not listed among the common adverse reactions (≥1%) which include diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, vaginitis in the setting of early Lyme disease, and others such as transient elevations in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH) and eosinophilia.

However, in the postmarketing experience section (6.2) of the drug label, ""renal dysfunction"" is mentioned as an adverse reaction identified during the post-approval use of cefuroxime axetil. It is important to note that postmarketing surveillance can include a range of renal-related issues, and the term ""renal dysfunction"" may encompass acute kidney injury, but it is not specific.

Since the frequency and causal relationship of renal dysfunction related to cefuroxime axetil cannot be reliably estimated through voluntary reports, there is insufficient evidence in the provided sections of the drug label to conclusively determine a direct association between AKI specifically and cefuroxime axetil therapy.

For healthcare practitioners and researchers seeking detailed information about a potential link between AKI and cefuroxime axetil, further investigation into medical literature such as case studies, clinical trial data, and additional postmarketing reports is advised. This investigation should look for documented instances of acute kidney injury in patients receiving cefuroxime, with an assessment of causality based on the timing of drug administration, the course of the adverse reaction, and the exclusion of alternate causes of kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,celecoxib,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to celecoxib:

Acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function, has been identified as an adverse reaction in the postmarketing experience with celecoxib. While the pre-marketing clinical trials, including those in osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), post-surgical pain, ankylosing spondylitis, and other pains such as dysmenorrhea, did not list AKI as a common adverse event, renal toxicity and related adverse effects were noted as possible issues of concern.

The drug label explicitly mentions renal toxicity and hyperkalemia as a concern within the ""Warnings and Precautions (5.6)"" section, indicating that celecoxib can impact renal function, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal disease or compromised renal perfusion. It advises that celecoxib should be used with caution in these individuals, suggesting a possible link between celecoxib use and renal adverse events.

In the ""Postmarketing Experience (6.2)"" section, AKI is explicitly documented as an observation made during the post-approval use of celecoxib. Since postmarketing reports are based on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, determining the frequency or establishing a causal relationship between drug exposure and AKI can be difficult. However, the inclusion of AKI in the label under postmarketing experience shows that there have been observed instances of AKI following celecoxib use, which implies that there is some evidence of this relationship.

In summary, while pre-marketing clinical trials of celecoxib did not commonly report AKI as an adverse event, there is postmarketing evidence that suggests AKI can occur as an adverse reaction to celecoxib. The evidence for AKI as an adverse reaction to celecoxib thus largely comes from postmarketing surveillance, and clinicians are cautioned to monitor renal function in patients taking the drug, especially in those with risk factors for renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,cephalexin,,"According to the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury can be an adverse reaction associated with cephalexin exposure. This derives from the mention of reversible interstitial nephritis reported in patients receiving cephalexin under the ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section of the label. Additionally, the ""Other Adverse Reactions"" subsection lists renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy as reported adverse reactions for cephalosporin class antibiotics, which includes cephalexin.

Details supporting this relationship come from the following sources:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Clinical trials have shown that reversible interstitial nephritis has been reported in patients treated with cephalexin. However, precise rates and direct comparisons with rates from other drugs are not provided, nor is it indicated how frequently interstitial nephritis occurs.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Under ""Other Adverse Reactions,"" renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy are listed for the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs. While these relate to the broader class rather than cephalexin specifically, it suggests that kidney-related adverse effects are not unprecedented within this class of medications.

3. **Altered Laboratory Tests**: The label also indicates that increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and increased creatinine have been reported. These are laboratory measures that, when elevated, can be indicative of acute kidney injury or impaired renal function.

There is no specific evidence provided in the form of details from case studies or identifying the severity, temporal association, or likelihood of acute kidney injury specifically from cephalexin in the label information.

It is important to note that while the drug label mentions acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction, the actual incidence or likelihood of this occurring is not quantified. Additionally, the relationship between cephalexin and acute kidney injury may be influenced by other patient-specific factors including pre-existing conditions, the presence of renal impairment, concomitant medications, and other individual patient factors. 

Healthcare practitioners are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the relevant authorities such as the FDA MedWatch program to contribute to post-marketing surveillance data and refine the understanding of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute kidney injury,ceritinib,,"The label for ceritinib (ZYKADIA) provided does not list acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction in the outlined sections; however, there is evidence to suggest a potential relationship between ceritinib use and renal effects. Specifically, within the clinical trials experience, increased blood creatinine levels were observed.

From the clinical trials included in the drug label, the following data points related to renal function are notable:

1. In the ASCEND-4 trial, where previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients were treated with ceritinib 750 mg, there was a reported incidence of increased blood creatinine in 14% of patients. Of these, the frequency of adverse reactions that led to dose reduction or interruption due to increased blood creatinine levels was not specified, but the overall dose reduction due to adverse reactions was required in 66%, and 12% discontinued therapy.

2. In the ASCEND-8 dose optimization study comparing ceritinib 450 mg with food to 750 mg under fasted conditions, increased blood creatinine level (grade 3/4) was not highlighted as a significant adverse reaction, suggesting either a lower incidence or less severe manifestations at a different dose or with food.

3. In the ASCEND-1 trial, an evaluation of the safety of ceritinib in already treated ALK-positive patients taking 750 mg daily under fasted conditions showed increased blood creatinine in 58% of patients, albeit grade 3 or 4 events were reported only in 2%.

While increased blood creatinine is a marker for renal function and can indicate potential kidney issues such as acute kidney injury, the label information provided does not directly link ceritinib to acute kidney injury as a clear adverse event. Instead, the data show that it can influence creatinine levels, suggesting that ceritinib has the potential to affect kidney function.

For healthcare professionals using ceritinib, it is essential to monitor renal function as increased blood creatinine levels can be an early marker of acute kidney injury. Careful dose management and monitoring are advised in patients showing signs of elevated blood creatinine levels.

In assessing the relationship between ceritinib and acute kidney injury, it is important to rely on clinical judgment alongside the product label, available clinical trial data, and any other relevant sources of real-world evidence. If acute kidney injury is suspected in a patient using ceritinib, it should be thoroughly investigated, considering all potential causes and managing according to standard clinical guidelines.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for ceritinib (ZYKADIA), there is no mention of acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials and post-marketing experience. The information focuses predominantly on gastrointestinal reactions, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, QT interval prolongation, hyperglycemia, bradycardia, and other adverse events such as pancreatitis, photosensitivity, and vision disorders. Acute kidney injury is not listed among the documented adverse reactions nor in the clinical trials experiences (ASCEND-1 and ASCEND-4), nor is it mentioned in the warnings and precautions section of the label. Therefore, based on the available evidence from this drug label, acute kidney injury does not appear to be an identified adverse reaction of ceritinib."
acute kidney injury,ceritinib,,"**Evidence Summary: Acute Kidney Injury and Ceritinib Exposure**

Based on the provided drug label information for ceritinib (ZYKADIA), acute kidney injury (AKI) is mentioned as one of the adverse reactions encountered in patients treated with ceritinib. Specifically, within the Clinical Trials Experience subsection of the Adverse Reactions section, increased blood creatinine (a marker typically indicative of kidney function impairment) was reported as follows:

- In the ASCEND-4 trial, which evaluated the safety of ceritinib in previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients, increased blood creatinine was observed as an adverse reaction. It was reported that this led to dose interruptions or reductions in 14% of patients and to discontinuation of ceritinib therapy in 2.1% of patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg daily under fasted conditions.
  
- In ASCEND-1, a study involving ALK-positive patients with various cancers treated with ceritinib at a dose of 750 mg daily under fasted conditions, an increase in blood creatinine was observed in 58% of patients, with grade 3-4 increases (indicating a more severe impairment of kidney function) occurring in 2%.

Furthermore, in the Warnings and Precautions section, renal failure is specifically listed as an adverse reaction occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg under fasted conditions. This indicates that ceritinib exposure may be associated with renal function impairment, including possible instances of AKI.

It's important to note, however, that although an observed increase in blood creatinine and reported renal failure implicate potential kidney injury, the clinical trial results do not detail specific cases or the criteria used to diagnose AKI, which can be multifactorial in etiology, particularly in patients with cancer who may have several other contributing factors. As such, causality must be interpreted with caution, though the evidence does suggest a potential relationship between ceritinib exposure and AKI.

For clinicians and patients, monitoring kidney function (e.g., through measuring blood creatinine levels) is advisable during ceritinib treatment, and dose adjustments may be necessary if significant renal impairment is detected.

**Source of Evidence:**
The evidence supporting the association of AKI with ceritinib use is derived from the clinical trial experiences reported in the drug's label, specifically from trials ASCEND-4 and ASCEND-1. The increased occurrence of elevated blood creatinine levels, as well as the reporting of renal failure in the post-marketing setting, provides the basis for this relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,certolizumab pegol,,"The provided drug label for certolizumab pegol (CIMZIA) details various adverse reactions experienced by patients during clinical trials and post-marketing experience. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed among the serious adverse reactions or other adverse reactions in the provided sections of the drug label, nor does it appear in the post-marketing experience section based on the current text.

Clinical Trials Experience and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The safety profile of certolizumab pegol was evaluated in clinical trials across several indications including Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis. Common adverse reactions identified in the clinical trials included upper respiratory infections, rash, and urinary tract infections. Serious adverse reactions reported in the trials included serious infections, malignancies, heart failure, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, neurologic reactions, hematologic reactions, and autoimmunity. Additionally, specific renal and urinary disorders mentioned in the label include nephrotic syndrome and renal failure, but not acute kidney injury per se.

Immunogenicity and Other Adverse Reactions:
Certolizumab pegol can induce the development of anti-drug antibodies, which sometimes correlate with lower drug plasma concentrations and reduced efficacy. This immunogenic response is mentioned in the context of various adverse reactions experienced during clinical trials but does not provide specific evidence linking to AKI.

Warnings and Precautions:
The warnings and precautions section of the label does not mention AKI directly. It primarily focusses on the risk of serious infections, malignancies, heart failure, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, neurologic reactions, hematologic reactions, autoimmunity, immunizations, and immunosuppression concerns associated with certolizumab pegol.

Conclusion:
From the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicitly listed evidence to support a direct relationship between certolizumab pegol exposure and acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. However, renal failure is briefly mentioned under the renal and urinary disorders subsection for Crohn’s disease. For a definitive summary, it's crucial to consult the full drug label and possibly additional data sources not included in the provided content. If more information is needed, especially regarding whether AKI is explicitly studied and reported with the use of certolizumab pegol, scientific literature and clinical trial databases may offer additional insights.",NA
acute kidney injury,certolizumab pegol,,"After reviewing the provided sections of the drug label for certolizumab pegol (CIMZIA®), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as a recognized adverse reaction to the drug in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. However, it is important to note that ""renal and urinary disorders"" including renal failure have been cited as infrequent but serious or significant adverse reactions observed in controlled and uncontrolled studies for Crohn's disease and other diseases in patients receiving CIMZIA at doses of 400 mg or other doses.

Renal failure, which can be a form of acute kidney injury, is a severe impairment of kidney function that can develop relatively quickly. It is mentioned that the drug's label includes renal failure within the broader category of adverse reactions, which suggests that some degree of kidney-related adverse effects may occur, albeit rarely.

Nonetheless, the information provided indicates that in general, the most common reactions to the drug across different indications include upper respiratory infections, rash, and urinary tract infections. Serious infections and malignancies are the most serious adverse reactions of concern and are given prominent warning in the drug label.

Since no direct and clear evidence connecting acute kidney injury specifically with certolizumab pegol is provided in the drug label sections you've shared, it would be important to conduct further literature searches, review individual case reports or clinical study data, and evaluate post-marketing surveillance reports for more detailed information on this potential adverse reaction.

Healthcare providers considering this medication should assess the risk of renal and urinary disorders along with other potential reactions, and monitor patients accordingly during and after treatment with certolizumab pegol. Patients should be encouraged to report any symptoms of renal impairment so that they can be promptly evaluated and managed.

If there were individual case reports or specific post-marketing surveillance data indicating a relationship between certolizumab pegol and acute kidney injury, a more conclusive statement could be made. However, based on the information provided, there is no definitive evidence that specifically links certolizumab pegol with acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,chlorothiazide,1.0,"In evaluating the evidence supporting the adverse reaction of acute kidney injury associated with chlorothiazide, it can be noted that under the ""Renal"" subsection of ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" reported on the drug label, there are mentions of ""renal failure"" and ""renal dysfunction"" alongside ""interstitial nephritis.""

Renal failure and renal dysfunction can encompass a spectrum of kidney-related issues, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Acute kidney injury is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days, which can cause wastes to build up in the body, potentially leading to high potassium levels and fluid overload.

Interstitial nephritis mentioned here is an important kidney disorder that involves inflammation of the kidneys' interstitial tissue, which can result in acute kidney injury if not addressed promptly.

Clinical trials typically assess the safety and efficacy of drugs, including the identification of potential adverse events. However, specific details from such trials regarding the incidence or characterization of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to chlorothiazide are not provided within the information supplied here from the drug label. Whether this adverse reaction was identified through clinical trials is therefore unclear from the label alone. It is recommended to review clinical study reports and publications from relevant clinical trials for detailed evidence.

Post-marketing surveillance, on the other hand, includes adverse event reports submitted to regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical manufacturers after the drug has been approved and is widely used. The inclusion of renal failure, renal dysfunction, and interstitial nephritis as adverse reactions in the drug label suggests that these were reported during post-marketing experience. Post-marketing reports can originate from healthcare professionals, patients, or literature sources and should be interpreted cautiously, as they often lack a control group and detailed patient information, which can complicate the assessment of causality.

The contact information for Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, and the FDA provided in the label indicates where suspected adverse reactions can be reported, suggesting an ongoing process of post-marketing surveillance.

In summary, the drug label for chlorothiazide does imply a recognized relationship between drug exposure and adverse renal effects, including AKI. The specifics of chlorothiazide-induced AKI being evidence-based are indirectly referenced by the inclusion of terms such as ""renal failure"" and ""renal dysfunction"" under reported adverse reactions, which may involve AKI. For clarity on the incidence rates or the strength of the relationship between chlorothiazide and AKI, more detailed data from clinical trials or observational studies would be necessary. As such, while there is an indication of a relationship, no explicit evidence from clinical trials or other specific sources is provided here. It is important to consult medical literature and data repositories for more comprehensive evidence.

acute kidney injury,chlorthalidone,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to chlorthalidone is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label, which includes adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings. The drug label outlines various potential adverse reactions to chlorthalidone, but AKI or renal-related issues are not specified in the listed observations. 

Clinical Trials:
The evidence from clinical trials about the relationship between chlorthalidone and AKI would typically be present in the initial approval documents and subsequent studies. Since AKI is not listed in the adverse reactions of the provided drug label sections, it suggests that AKI may not have been identified as a frequent adverse event in the clinical trials pertinent to chlorthalidone approval or that there is insufficient data about its incidence.

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Case studies and post-marketing surveillance reports are critical for identifying rarer or longer-term adverse effects that may not have been apparent during clinical trials. If case studies or post-marketing reports had consistently identified AKI as a potential adverse effect of chlorthalidone, it is likely that it would be reflected in the drug's labeling under adverse reactions or warnings.

While AKI is a recognized outcome associated with certain diuretics, due to their effects on renal hemodynamics, the absence of explicit mention in the provided sections of the Chlorthalidone label implies that there may not be substantial evidence directly linking AKI to chlorthalidone at this time or that it is not a common occurrence. However, given that AKI is a serious condition, it may still be possible that isolated cases or small-scale observations have been reported.

Without detailed reports or a review of the full scientific literature including post-marketing surveillance data outside of the drug label, potential links between chlorthalidone and AKI would be speculative. Practitioners should monitor renal function in patients receiving diuretics, including chlorthalidone, since any diuretic can potentially cause renal impairment, especially in patients with preexisting renal disease or when used in conjunction with other nephrotoxic drugs.

In summary, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between chlorthalidone and the occurrence of acute kidney injury that has been systematically reported and recognized at the time of this literature review. If concerns about AKI and chlorthalidone arise, clinicians should consider individual patient factors and associated literature for case-specific clinical decision-making.",NA
acute kidney injury,ciprofloxacin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI), also known as acute renal failure, is a serious condition that manifests as a sudden decrease in kidney function over hours to days, resulting in the accumulation of waste products and imbalance of electrolytes in the body. The drug label for ciprofloxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, provides extensive information regarding its adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions, but does not list acute kidney injury as a common adverse event nor does it explicitly state it under the 'Renal/Urogenital' subsection in section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience.

However, the label does mention under section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience that interstitial nephritis, which can cause or be associated with acute renal insufficiency or failure, has been reported following ciprofloxacin use, as reported from the worldwide marketing experience with fluoroquinolones. Interstitial nephritis is a form of kidney injury characterized by inflammation in the spaces between the kidney tubules and can lead to AKI.

The evidence relating ciprofloxacin to AKI primarily comes from case studies and post-marketing surveillance given that this adverse event is not prominently featured in the initial clinical trials data. Post-marketing data depends on voluntary reporting, making it challenging to determine the precise frequency or establish a causal relationship due to the population size being uncertain.

Additionally, under sections 5.6 and 5.8, the label notes that serious adverse reactions, such as acute renal insufficiency or failure, have been reported and that cases of severe hepatotoxicity may be associated with hypersensitivity. While these notations do not state a direct link between ciprofloxacin and AKI, they indicate the possibility of renal-related adverse outcomes.

In conclusion, while the clinical trials section of the ciprofloxacin label does not explicitly report AKI as a significant adverse reaction based on the initial trial data, post-marketing surveillance does suggest an association between ciprofloxacin and renal adverse effects, including interstitial nephritis and potential acute renal failure. The prescribing information advises monitoring for signs of serious adverse reactions and discontinuing the drug if necessary. Healthcare providers considering ciprofloxacin treatment should be vigilant about these potential renal risks and may need to monitor renal function, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those taking concomitant medications that affect kidney function.",NA
acute kidney injury,cisplatin,,"The relationship between acute kidney injury and cisplatin use is well-established within the medical community, supported by evidence found in clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, as summarized from the drug label information provided:

1. **Clinical Trials and Drug Label Warnings**: The drug label for cisplatin explicitly lists nephrotoxicity as a common adverse reaction (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS), and goes into detail about the severity and nature of the renal toxicity associated with its use. The warning sections (WARNING and 5.1 Nephrotoxicity) emphasize that cisplatin injection can cause severe renal toxicity, which includes acute renal failure, and is dose-related and cumulative. It's described that renal toxicity often begins during the second week after administration of cisplatin.

2. **Population at Risk**: The same sections also note that certain populations are more susceptible to nephrotoxic effects of cisplatin, specifically highlighting baseline renal impairment, geriatric patients, patients on concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, and those not adequately hydrated.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: The label stresses the importance of adequate hydration and monitoring renal function and electrolytes, indicating a strong recognition of the risk of kidney damage. Additionally, it suggests dose reductions or seeking alternative treatments in patients with compromised renal function to mitigate the risk (5.1 Nephrotoxicity).

4. **Post-marketing Surveillance**: Adverse reactions identified from post-marketing surveillance are mentioned, including nephrotoxicity such as renal failure and other kidney-related issues, indicating that these issues were observed during actual patient use after the drug was marketed (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The inclusion of nephrotoxicity in the warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions sections of the drug label for cisplatin confirms the established relationship between cisplatin exposure and the adverse reaction of acute kidney injury. It is clear from these labeling details that the evidence is substantial and well-documented, with specific recommendations made for monitoring and managing the risk.

In summary, the evidence supporting acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to cisplatin is comprehensive and includes clinical trial data, as well as observations from real-world use post-marketing. This information is confirmed and clearly stated in the drug labeling and prescribing information as provided.",NA
acute kidney injury,citalopram,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not listed as an adverse reaction of citalopram in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. Here's a summary of the evidence from the provided sections:

Clinical Trials Experience: In the text detailing the clinical trials experience, adverse reactions to citalopram are listed, including common gastrointestinal, nervous system, psychiatric, and sexual disorders, along with ECG changes. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions are compared between citalopram-treated and placebo-treated patients. While several adverse reactions are associated with discontinuation and are prevalent enough to be noted, acute kidney injury is not mentioned among them.

Postmarketing Experience: The postmarketing experience section details adverse reactions identified during the postapproval use of citalopram or its enantiomer escitalopram. This includes a wide range of systems and conditions, including but not limited to cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, hepatic disorders, and others. Acute kidney injury is specifically mentioned under the ""Renal and Urinary Disorders"" as a reported postmarketing adverse reaction.

Warnings and Precautions: Several warnings and precautions are highlighted for patients with certain health conditions and when using citalopram in combination with other drugs. These include risks for QT prolongation, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania/hypomania, glaucoma, hyponatremia, and sexual dysfunction. There is no warning or precaution specified for acute kidney injury.

Considering the information given, there is postmarketing evidence that indicates acute kidney injury has been reported as an adverse reaction during the use of citalopram. While it is not a commonly listed adverse reaction based on pre-approval data, the identification of AKI in the postmarketing setting suggests that healthcare providers should be attentive to signs and symptoms of kidney injury in patients taking citalopram. It is important to note that postmarketing adverse reaction reports are voluntary and the size of the affected population is uncertain, which makes it challenging to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. ","NA

Based on the information provided and the established understanding of citalopram's safety profile, acute kidney injury is not listed as an adverse reaction to citalopram. The sections provided detail various adverse reactions and warnings associated with citalopram, none of which include acute kidney injury. If new evidence arises that suggests a link between citalopram and acute kidney injury, this conclusion may need reevaluation. However, as of the current data and the knowledge cutoff in 2023, there is no evidence to support acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to citalopram."
acute kidney injury,cladribine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cladribine, there is evidence suggesting that acute kidney injury could be an adverse reaction associated with its use, particularly at high doses. This assertion is substantiated by the following:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: The adverse reactions listed in the clinical trials do not explicitly include acute kidney injury; however, trials reported neutropenia, anemia, and other hematologic toxicities. While these effects are not directly related to kidney function, cladribine's impact on bone marrow could theoretically contribute to systemic effects that might indirectly affect kidney health.

2. **Post-marketing Experience**: Under this section, renal failure including acute renal failure and renal impairment are specifically documented as adverse reactions observed following commercial availability of the drug. Although the incidence of these renal-related issues is not quantified, their inclusion suggests that there have been reports of kidney injury following cladribine administration during post-marketing surveillance.

3. **Warnings**: The warning section of the label explicitly mentions acute nephrotoxicity as a risk, particularly with high doses of cladribine. It notes that this risk is compounded when the drug is administered in conjunction with other nephrotoxic therapies. This clearly indicates a recognized connection between high-dose cladribine exposure and the potential for kidney injury.

The primary evidence for the relationship between cladribine and acute kidney injury comes from post-marketing reports and the drug's warning section, suggesting that while acute kidney injury is not a commonly reported adverse reaction, it has been observed and is a recognized risk especially at higher dosages.

In summary, while the clinical trials data for cladribine do not directly link the drug to acute kidney injury, both post-marketing experience and the warnings provided in the drug label suggest a potential relationship between high-dose cladribine and nephrotoxicity. Clinicians should be aware of this risk and monitor renal function, particularly when administering higher doses or in combination with other nephrotoxic drugs.","Based on the information provided from the clinical trials and post-marketing experience, acute kidney injury is not listed as an adverse reaction in patients who received the recommended dose of cladribine for Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). Acute nephrotoxicity has been observed with high doses of cladribine (4 to 9 times the recommended dose for HCL), especially when administered concomitantly with other nephrotoxic agents/therapies. Therefore, in the context of standard dosing regimens for HCL, there is no evidence provided to support that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction of cladribine. The absence of such an association in the reported adverse reactions and in the warnings for recommended dosages indicates that acute kidney injury is not considered a typical risk at therapeutic levels for HCL treatment. However, it is essential to recognize that individual patient factors or concurrent medications may contribute to adverse renal events, and these would not necessarily be captured in the overall safety profile as directly related to cladribine."
acute kidney injury,clarithromycin,,"The provided drug label sections for clarithromycin do not list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a documented adverse reaction either from clinical trial experience (section 6.1) or postmarketing surveillance (section 6.2). The adverse reactions related to the renal system that are mentioned include:

- Elevated serum creatinine levels in less than 1% of patients (in combination therapy with omeprazole)
- Interstitial nephritis and renal failure reported during postmarketing surveillance, but without frequency or a clear causal relationship established.
- Acute kidney injury mentioned in the context of serious adverse reactions with concomitant use of calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (section 5.4), primarily involving elderly patients.

The label emphasizes that most reports of acute kidney injury with CYP3A4-metabolized calcium channel blockers involved elderly patients, implying a potential drug-drug interaction rather than a direct adverse effect of clarithromycin on the kidneys.

To conclude, the provided drug label sections do not offer evidence of a direct relationship between clarithromycin administration and the occurrence of AKI. However, there is indirect mention of kidney-related issues in elderly patients when clarithromycin is used in conjunction with specific other drugs. For a definitive claim of AKI as an adverse reaction to clarithromycin, additional studies or clinical evidence beyond the provided drug label would be required.",NA
acute kidney injury,clevidipine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute kidney injury is mentioned as an adverse reaction in the context of Cleviprex (clevidipine) use during clinical trials. The evidence is as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: In placebo-controlled perioperative studies (ESCAPE-1 and ESCAPE-2), acute renal failure was documented as a treatment-emergent adverse reaction in ESCAPE-1, occurring in 5 out of 53 patients (9%) in the group treated with Clevipex, compared to 1 out of 51 patients (2%) in the placebo group. There is no mention of acute renal failure or acute kidney injury in the ESCAPE-2 results according to the summary provided.

2. The ECLIPSE studies, which were randomized, parallel, open-label and involved longer exposures in cardiac surgery patients, compared Cleviprex to active comparators (nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine). Here, the summary does not specifically highlight acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction relative to the comparators. Furthermore, it is stated that distinguishing the adverse event profile linked to blood pressure-lowering drugs versus surgical procedure-related events is challenging, suggesting that direct attribution of acute kidney injury to Cleviprex in this setting is less clear.

3. Post-Marketing and Other Clinical Experience: While acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned in the post-marketing surveillance section provided, this subsection does acknowledge that other adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Cleviprex. However, due to the nature of voluntary reporting and uncertain population size, reliable estimation of the frequency of such associations or establishing a causal relationship to Cleviprex exposure is difficult.

To conclude, there is evidence from the ESCAPE-1 clinical trial that suggests a relationship between acute kidney injury and Cleviprex exposure in the perioperative setting. However, this evidence should be interpreted with caution given the relatively small sample size and the overall complexity of health status in patients undergoing surgery which could contribute to the occurrence of such adverse reactions. Additional well-controlled studies or pharmacovigilance data would be needed to confirm this relationship and establish a clear causative role for Cleviprex in acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,clevidipine,,"The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and clevidipine use can be summarized based on evidence primarily from clinical trials included in the drug label.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The suggestion of an adverse reaction of AKI comes from data in Table 2 under section 6.1 of the clinical trials experience. In the ESCAPE-1 perioperative study, acute renal failure (a term that can be associated with acute kidney injury) was documented in 5 out of 53 patients (9%) treated with clevidipine, compared to 1 out of 51 patients (2%) receiving a placebo. It is important to note that ESCAPE-2 did not report AKI instances, which may suggest variability or possibly limited data.

The ESCAPE trials seem to have been short, with a small sample size and a limited duration of about 30 minutes. Furthermore, the ECLIPSE studies compared clevidipine with active comparators (nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, and nicardipine) in cardiac surgery patients and did not report AKI as a common adverse reaction associated with clevidipine treatment.

No specific reported incidence of AKI related to clevidipine was provided concerning patients with severe hypertension in section 6.1 (non-placebo-controlled VELOCITY study). The common adverse reactions listed for clevidipine in this population included headache, nausea, and vomiting, but not AKI.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
Regarding post-marketing experience (section 6.2), AKI is not listed among the adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of clevidipine. Reported reactions include increased blood triglycerides, ileus, hypersensitivity, hypotension, nausea, decreased oxygen saturation, and reflex tachycardia.

Warnings and Precautions:
Lastly, examination of the warnings and precautions sections (5.1 to 5.7) does not indicate AKI or renal failure as a warned potential consequence of drug use.

In conclusion, the available evidence supporting a relationship between AKI and clevidipine exposure is limited and comes from a small subset of perioperative patients in ESCAPE-1, a controlled clinical trial. Post-marketing surveillance data have not identified AKI as an adverse reaction during the broader use of clevidipine. Additionally, AKI is not listed in the warnings and precautions for clevidipine use. It is important for clinicians to report any suspected adverse reactions to further evaluate the safety profile of this drug. Further studies and ongoing surveillance are essential to clarify the potential risk of AKI with clevidipine use.","NA

The provided drug label sections mention acute renal failure as an adverse reaction observed in 5 (9%) of the patients treated with clevidipine in the ESCAPE-1 perioperative hypertension study, in contrast to 1 (2%) in the placebo group. This suggests a potential association rather than refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and clevidipine exposure. There is no evidence provided in the sections you have supplied that refutes the relationship between acute kidney injury and clevidipine exposure."
acute kidney injury,clindamycin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for clindamycin, there is mention of renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria observed during clindamycin therapy. However, the label explicitly states that no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established. This indicates that while there have been observed incidents of renal dysfunction, these cases have not been definitively linked to clindamycin as a cause.

The absence of a clear causal link in the label suggests that evidence supporting acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction to clindamycin may be limited or not conclusively established. This does not rule out the possibility, but rather, there may not have been sufficient clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance reports at the time of this label's publication to confirm a direct relationship.

It should be noted that adverse reactions can be underreported, and establishing a causal relationship between a drug and an adverse event often requires a robust body of evidence including well-controlled studies, comprehensive case reports, and extensive post-marketing surveillance data.

In summary, there is an observation of renal dysfunction in patients treated with clindamycin as noted in the drug label, but no direct causal relationship to clindamycin-induced acute kidney injury has been established from the information provided. Medical professionals may consider this information when prescribing clindamycin, and further investigation or monitoring for renal function might be prudent in at-risk patient populations. Additional data from future studies or reported cases may further clarify the relationship between clindamycin and renal adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,clopidogrel,,"The provided drug label sections for clopidogrel do not list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a known adverse reaction. The adverse reactions and warnings mentioned in the label primarily focus on bleeding complications, which are common for antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel. Specifically, the label details clinical trial experiences involving bleeding events and other less commonly reported adverse events including various hematologic, gastrointestinal, immune system, and skin disorders.

The post-marketing experience section, which usually includes rarer or less well-characterized adverse events identified after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use, does not mention AKI either. Instead, it lists ""increased creatinine levels"" under renal and urinary disorders, which can be an indicator of impaired kidney function but does not directly confirm AKI.

Acute kidney injury is a complex condition that can have various causes, including ischemia, exposure to substances that are toxic to the kidneys, inflammation, and more. Without specific evidence provided in the label or sourcing additional scientific literature identifying AKI as a direct result of clopidogress use, there is no clear support within the provided drug label data to establish a relationship between clopidogrel exposure and acute kidney injury.

In summary, based on the drug label information provided, there is no indicated evidence to support that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction to clopidogrel. Clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance information included in the label focus on bleeding risks and do not report AKI as an observed adverse reaction. If there is evidence outside of this label that suggests otherwise, it would need to be evaluated separately.",NA
acute kidney injury,clozapine,0.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and clozapine use is not explicitly detailed in the drug label sections provided, which cover various warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions known to be associated with clozapine. According to the provided label information, AKI is not listed as a common adverse reaction, nor is it highlighted under clinical trials experience or post-marketing experience.

However, acute interstitial nephritis, a condition that can lead to AKI, is mentioned under ""Urogenital System"" in the “Postmarketing Experience” section, suggesting that incidents have been identified after the drug was approved for use, based on voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size. The specific frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure is not clearly established due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

For a comprehensive overview of the evidence, a review of external medical literature and clinical case studies is required. As part of post-marketing surveillance and case reports in medical literature, AKI has been reported as a potential adverse effect of clozapine, though such cases are generally rare. This evidence is not reflected in the drug label information you provided and may not represent a widely acknowledged or high-incidence complication.

If AKI or related renal issues are suspected in a patient taking clozapine, it is important to perform a detailed clinical evaluation to establish causality, taking into account all potential contributing factors, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. Healthcare professionals should remain vigilant for this potential adverse reaction due to the seriousness of AKI, despite its rarity and the limited evidence directly linking it to clozapine.",NA
acute kidney injury,cobicistat,,"**Evidence Summary: Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction to Cobicistat**

**Clinical Trial Data:**
Data from clinical trials of STRIBILD (which includes cobicistat as a component) exhibit nephrotoxicity as a potential adverse event. Renal adverse reactions were a cause for discontinuation of treatment in 1.4% of subjects receiving STRIBILD (10 out of 701 subjects) within 96 weeks, compared to 0.3% in the comparator groups. Four subjects (0.6%) developed proximal renal tubulopathy leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD. The trials also emphasize the importance of monitoring renal function, as cobicistat may increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion, which does not reflect actual change in glomerular function.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
Regarding the postmarketing experience, renal and urinary disorders including acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, and interstitial nephritis have been identified as adverse reactions with the use of tenofovir DF, which like cobicistat, is a component of STRIBILD.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The prescribing information highlights new onset or worsening renal impairment, including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, as adverse reactions that have been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, and occurrence of such events has been also documented with STRIBILD. Patients are advised on the need to assess creatinine clearance before initiating treatment and to monitor renal function during therapy. 

**Laboratory Abnormalities:**
Table 4 in the provided label data also indicates changes in serum creatinine and eGFR at Week 96 with STRIBILD treatment, suggesting an adverse impact on renal function.

**Summary:**
The evidence supports an association between cobicistat (as a part of the STRIBILD regimen) and the potential risk for acute kidney injury—including tubulopathy events—which is solidified by data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Recommendations for monitoring and evaluating renal function before and during treatment with STRIBILD underscore the recognized risk of renal adverse reactions related to the use of cobicistat. Renal adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD further substantiate this association.",NA
acute kidney injury,cobicistat,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and cobicistat exposure emerges from several sources, including clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the pharmacological action of the drug as described in the provided drug label sections.

From the clinical trials experience detailed in the product label, particularly from Trial 114 cited in section 6.1, it is noted that renal and urinary disorders like nephropathy and Fanconi syndrome were reported. These conditions are linked to kidney function and could potentially lead to acute kidney injury. Furthermore, the product label under Warnings and Precautions (section 5.2) mentions cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome associated with cobicistat when used in a regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).

Additionally, section 5.1 of the label describes how cobicistat can lead to increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance due to the inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. While this action does not affect actual renal glomerular function, it indicates an effect on renal processing which could be related to kidney injury if other renal impairments are present.

The label also advises against the coadministration of cobicistat with TDF in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min because dosing adjustments have not been established and there is a potential for renal adverse events.

In section 5.2, it is clarified that through 144 weeks of a clinical trial, renal adverse events led to the discontinuation of study drug in 2.9% of subjects in the cobicistat group. Furthermore, the presence of laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, potentially a precursor or component of acute kidney injury, was observed and led to discontinuation in some subjects.

The label's sections 5 and 6 evoke evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience regarding the impact of cobicistat on renal function and highlight the potential for adverse renal effects. The trial data, although not specifying acute kidney injury per se, do suggest a relationship between cobicistat exposure and renal dysfunction, which can include acute kidney injury among its manifestations.

To conclude, based on the drug label information provided, evidence from clinical trials suggests a connection between cobicistat use and adverse renal events that could include acute kidney injury, particularly when used in combination with TDF. The exact mechanism of cobicistat's impact on kidney function is through the inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine rather than a direct effect on glomerular function. This evidence is derived from the clinical trials' data and post-marketing reports included in the medication's warning and precautions sections.",NA
acute kidney injury,cobimetinib,,"Evidence supporting the association between acute kidney injury and cobimetinib exposure comes from clinical trial data presented in the safety evaluation section of the drug's label. Specifically, the label for cobimetinib (COTELLIC) reports findings from two clinical trials, Trial 1 and Trial 2, which assessed the safety and efficacy of the drug in different patient populations.

In Trial 2, which assessed the safety of COTELLIC in patients with histiocytic neoplasms, acute kidney injury was observed as an adverse reaction. Specifically:

- Acute kidney injury was reported in 15% of the participants, with 12% experiencing a serious (Grade 3 or 4) event. This rate of acute kidney injury is a direct observation from this clinical study and suggests a potential causal relationship between cobimetinib and the observed renal adverse events.
- The median treatment duration for patients in Trial 2 was 10.7 months, providing a significant period for the observation of adverse events, including acute kidney injury.

No specific mention is made of this adverse reaction in the context of Trial 1, which evaluated the safety of COTELLIC in previously untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation-positive status, in combination with vemurafenib. However, Trial 2 provides direct evidence of acute kidney injury associated with the use of COTELLIC in the studied patient population.

It is important to note that the label does contain a general warning that findings from clinical trials are not always directly comparable to rates observed in different clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates seen in practice. Additionally, no specific post-marketing surveillance data is mentioned concerning acute kidney injury, so it is unclear whether this adverse reaction has been commonly reported in a wider patient population following the approval of the drug.

Overall, the evidence from Trial 2 indicates that there is a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to cobimetinib in patients with histiocytic neoplasms. Careful monitoring of renal function is advised when prescribing this medication, as per the documented adverse reactions.",NA
acute kidney injury,colchicine,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious condition wherein the kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from the blood. While the drug label provided for colchicine does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction, it does mention injury to cells in the renal system among its toxic manifestations. These renal injuries are most likely to occur with colchicine toxicity, which can arise from excessive accumulation or overdosage of the drug.

The sections of the label describe gastrointestinal disorders as the most common adverse reactions, with toxicity to the renal system included among other potentially serious toxic effects. With links to myelosuppression, neuromuscular toxicity, and disruptions in liver function tests such as elevated AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), the warning signs for these toxicities might precede or occur concurrently with kidney damage.

Clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking colchicine to AKI were not provided, and so cannot be reviewed in this response. However, since colchicine is known to lead to cellular injuries in various organs, including the kidneys, especially when used in excess, there is a theoretical risk that AKI could result from colchicine toxicity. Furthermore, colchicine has known interactions with drugs that inhibit both CYP3A4 and P-gp, potentially leading to increased systemic levels of the drug, which could contribute to the risk of AKI if renal clearance is impaired.

Patients with impaired renal function are advised to be at increased risk for colchicine toxicity, which indirectly suggests that colchicine can contribute to renal injury.

In summary, while the drug label for colchicine does not directly list acute kidney injury as one of the common adverse effects, it acknowledges that toxicity from colchicine can affect the renal system, primarily when the drug accumulates or is overdosed. Close monitoring for toxicity is recommended, particularly in patients with compromised renal function. If acute kidney injury were to be suspected as a result of colchicine use, it would likely be due to a toxic reaction or improper dosing, especially in the context of contraindicated drug interactions or pre-existing renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,cyclophosphamide,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and cyclophosphamide exposure includes the following:

1. Clinical Trials and Studies: Clinical trials and observational studies can provide direct evidence of drug-induced acute kidney injury. However, in the provided drug label sections, specific details from clinical trials regarding acute kidney injury are not given.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance: Post-marketing surveillance gathers data on adverse effects of drugs after they have been approved for use. In the provided drug label, under section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience, several renal and urinary adverse reactions are listed, which include ""renal failure, renal tubular disorder, renal impairment, and nephropathy toxic."" These terms are indicative of kidney dysfunction, and although ""acute kidney injury"" is not specified, the listed adverse reactions fall within the spectrum of conditions that can be classified as acute kidney impairment or injury.

3. Warnings and Precautions: Under section 5.2 Urinary Tract and Renal Toxicity, cyclophosphamide is associated with adverse effects on the urinary tract and kidneys, including ""hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis, and hematuria."" While this does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury, the listed conditions represent forms of urotoxicity which can contribute to or be associated with kidney injury.

4. Case Reports and Series: While not explicitly referenced in the drug label, individual case reports and case series in medical literature have documented instances of acute kidney injury associated with cyclophosphamide use, reinforcing the relationship seen in broader data.

In conclusion, while acute kidney injury is not specifically mentioned in the drug label sections provided, there is an implication of its association with cyclophosphamide based on the listing of related renal and urinary toxicities in the post-marketing experience and under warnings and precautions. Clinical practice and literature support a relationship between cyclophosphamide exposure and acute kidney injury, even if the drug label does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. Healthcare providers should monitor kidney function in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and manage any identified renal issues appropriately.",NA
acute kidney injury,cyclosporine,1.0,"**Evidence Summary: Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction of Cyclosporine**

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**
The drug label excerpts provide substantial evidence from controlled clinical trials showing that renal dysfunction and increased creatinine levels are common adverse reactions to cyclosporine. In controlled studies comparing cyclosporine capsules (modified) with Sandimmune, the adverse events observed in 493 transplanted patients were similar, with renal dysfunction reported in a significant proportion (renal dysfunction 32% in kidney transplant patients). The label also reports that discontinuation of cyclosporine therapy due to renal toxicity occurred in 5.4% of kidney transplant patients.

**Case Studies:**
Although no specific individual case studies are referenced in the drug label, the detailed reporting of renal-related adverse reactions (including renal dysfunction and increased creatinine levels) suggests that such case evidence would support the relationship between acute kidney injury and cyclosporine use.

**Post-marketing Surveillance:**
The label provides data from post-marketing experiences indicating that renal toxicity is a serious concern, with cases of glomerular capillary thrombosis progressing to graft failure. It lists renal toxicity as a reason for treatment discontinuation in 5.4% of cases. Additionally, there is mention of polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially with BK virus, resulting in graft loss, which reinforces the association between cyclosporine and renal adverse effects.

**Box Warnings and Other Warnings:**
The warnings highlight that cyclosporine can cause systemic hypertension and nephrotoxicity. The drug label emphasizes the necessity to monitor renal function during therapy because of the potential for structural kidney damage, indicating a clear recognition of the relationship between cyclosporine exposure and nephrotoxic risk.

**Summary Conclusion:**
The evidence from clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance demonstrates a significant association between cyclosporine use and acute kidney injury. The detailed adverse reactions, in conjunction with the careful monitoring of renal function recommended in the label, support the conclusion that acute kidney injury is a known and serious adverse reaction of cyclosporine therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,cysteamine,,"Based on the provided excerpts from the drug label regarding adverse reactions and warnings, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to cysteamine. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are related to ocular issues such as sensitivity to light, redness, eye pain/irritation, headache, and visual field defects. Moreover, warnings include contamination, benign intracranial hypertension, and caution with contact lens use due to benzalkonium chloride.

Clinical Trials Experience:
From the clinical trials experience detailed in Section 6.1, there is no reference to acute kidney injury. The safety data described from controlled clinical trials ranging from six months to 19 years and involving approximately 300 patients lists ocular adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients but does not mention renal complications.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
The provided sections of the drug label do not discuss post-marketing surveillance data concerning acute kidney injury.

Warnings:
Reports of benign intracranial hypertension associated with oral cysteamine have been mentioned in section 5.2, with a resolution using diuretic therapy, but again, no correlation with acute kidney injury is indicated.

In summary, the provided sections of the drug label pertaining to cysteamine do not support a relationship between the drug and the occurrence of acute kidney injury. If other literature or post-marketing surveillance were to reveal such an association, it is not included in the provided details. It is crucial, however, for healthcare providers to consult the full prescribing information and consider the entire body of literature and post-marketing reports when evaluating the potential risks of a medication.",NA
acute kidney injury,dactinomycin,,"Acute kidney injury is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to dactinomycin (also known as Actinomycin D) based on the drug label details provided. The evidence for this relationship is supported by the inclusion of ""Renal Toxicity"" under 'Warnings and Precautions (5.7)' on the drug label. This section advises monitoring creatinine and electrolytes frequently during therapy with COSMEGEN (the trade name for dactinomycin), which indicates a risk of renal function abnormalities, including acute kidney injury, associated with the drug's administration.

According to the label details, the following elements contribute to the evidence supporting acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction to dactinomycin:

1. **Drug Label Warnings:**
   The 'Renal Toxicity' warning under '5.7 Renal Toxicity' on the label suggests that abnormalities of renal function have been observed with the use of dactinomycin, indicating that there is awareness and concern about the nephrotoxic potential of the drug.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
   The 'Renal and urinary' subsection under '6 ADVERSE REACTIONS' mentions 'renal impairment' and 'renal failure,' which are considered severe outcomes of kidney toxicity from the drug use. Although not explicitly stated as 'acute kidney injury,' these terms imply that significant kidney damage, potentially acute in nature, has been observed.

It should be noted that while renal toxicity is recognized, the specific term ""acute kidney at the time of the drug's labeling has not been used injury"" may not be explicitly stated within the sections provided. Additionally, no explicit mention of clinical trial data, case studies, or numerical frequency of this adverse reaction is provided in the sections cited.

In practice, the evidence for acute kidney injury from dactinomycin arises from the drug’s labeled warnings that suggest such renal issues have been observed and deemed significant enough to warrant monitoring and precautionary measures. The relationship between dactinomycin exposure and renal toxicity, including acute kidney injury, would typically be established through clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data, but specific details from these sources are not included in the information provided.

It is important for healthcare providers to closely monitor renal function in patients receiving dactinomycin and to be cautious of the associated risk of renal toxicity. Additionally, it may be advised for healthcare professionals to report any suspected cases of acute kidney injury associated with dactinomycin to improve the body of evidence surrounding this adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,dantrolene,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for dantrolene, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as a documented adverse reaction in the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section or within the ""WARNINGS"" and ""Box Warnings"" of the label. The adverse reactions listed primarily focus on the drug's effects on the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal system, and significant risk of hepatotoxicity, which is emphasized in the warnings and has been associated with fatal and non-fatal hepatitis.

It is important to note that post-marketing surveillance and spontaneous reports have the potential to identify additional adverse reactions not captured during the clinical trials. However, the provided label excerpt does not include acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction from post-marketing surveillance.

In the absence of a direct mention within the given drug label sections, it can be concluded that, based on this specific source, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and dantrolene exposure. Clinical professionals use drug labels as a comprehensive source of information about adverse events, and if such an association were recognized, it would likely be mentioned in the label. However, this does not entirely rule out the possibility of such an event being reported in case studies or additional medical literature not included within the drug label. For a more conclusive evaluation, a thorough review of the broader biomedical literature, including clinical studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance databases outside of the label, would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,dapagliflozin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is identified as a potential adverse reaction to dapagliflozin (marketed as FARXIGA) within the post-marketing experience section of the drug's label. Although the clinical trials sections (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience and Table 2: Adverse Reactions) do not explicitly report AKI as an observed adverse reaction in the studied patient populations, the postmarketing experience (section 6.2) mentions AKI as an identified adverse reaction following approval and widespread use of the drug. It is important to note that postmarketing surveillance can capture rarer adverse events that may not be detected in clinical trials due to sample size or trial duration.

Based on the provided drug label information:

**Clinical Trials:** The clinical trials section (6.1) of the label outlines adverse reactions observed during the drug's clinical trials. Common adverse reactions in the trials included genital mycotic infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infections, among others. AKI is not listed among the common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials.

**Postmarketing Experience:** Under section 6.2, AKI is explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction that has been identified during post-approval use of FARXIGA in patients with diabetes mellitus. Due to the nature of voluntary reporting in post-marketing surveillance, it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency of AKI or to establish a definitive causal relationship to dapagliflozin exposure without further investigation. This acknowledgment within the drug label suggests there is at least some evidence, based on real-world usage, to warrant listing AKI as a potential risk.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Section 5.2 of the label warns of volume depletion as a known risk of FARXIGA, which could theoretically contribute to the development of AKI, especially in patients with risk factors such as impaired renal function, elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics.

**Conclusion:** While acute kidney injury is not reported as a common adverse reaction from clinical trials of dapagliflozin, it is listed as an adverse reaction observed in the post-marketing period. Clinicians should be vigilant of this potential risk, especially in patients with predisposing factors for renal impairment. Further investigation and continuous monitoring of post-marketing data can help clarify the strength of the relationship between dapagliflozin and the risk of AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,dapagliflozin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to dapagliflozin is acknowledged in the postmarketing experience, per the provided drug label excerpt. Here is a summary of the main evidence and source of information: 

**Clinical Trials:**
The clinical trials data provided in the drug label does not explicitly list AKI as an observed adverse reaction during the studies. However, the drug is known to cause osmotic diuresis, leading to volume depletion and reductions in intravascular volume (Table 3), which can potentially contribute to kidney stress.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
Post-marketing reports after approval and widespread use of dapagliflozin have more clearly identified AKI as an adverse event. These cannot be quantified or causally linked to drug exposure with high confidence due to the nature of voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size. Nevertheless, the mention of AKI in this section (Section 6.2: Postmarketing Experience) indicates that post-approval reports have been significant enough to warrant inclusion (Renal and Urinary Disorders: Acute kidney injury).

**Drug Warnings and Precautions (5.2):**
The warning regarding volume depletion acknowledges the risk of intravascular volume depletion, which may lead to symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine, implying possible kidney involvement.

**Laboratory Tests:**
There are documented increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) upon initiation of dapagliflozin therapy, suggesting an effect on renal function. Although these changes reportedly stabilize, any deviation from this pattern warrants further investigation for AKI.

In conclusion, while AKI as an adverse reaction to dapagliflozin is not identified among the common adverse reactions in clinical trials, post-marketing reports and the drug's mechanism of action, which affects fluid balance and renal function, support the plausibility of such an association. Clinicians should be aware of this potential risk and monitor renal function when initiating therapy with dapagliflozin, especially in patients with predisposing factors for AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,daptomycin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is mentioned as one of the adverse reactions identified during the post-marketing experience with daptomycin (Section 6.2 of the drug label). Unlike other adverse events listed in the sections for clinical trials (Section 6.1) and warnings and precautions (Section 5), AKI is not detailed in the sections that typically report findings from controlled clinical research, such as randomized trials or systematic observations during the drug development process.

In post-marketing surveillance, the incidence of adverse reactions is generally lower than in clinical trials because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. Therefore, it is often challenging to establish a firm causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event due to underreporting and the lack of controlled conditions.

The mention of AKI in Section 6.2 suggests that reports of kidney injury have been received following the approval of daptomycin. These reports could come from health care professionals, patients, or other sources and indicate that there is evidence of an association between daptomycin and AKI, though causal relationships are less firm than would be established in controlled clinical studies.

Warning and precaution Section 5.5 specifically mentions tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), a possible cause of AKI. This implies recognition of a kidney-related adverse effect potentially linked to the medication, highlighting the need for discontinuation and appropriate treatment if TIN is suspected, thus providing a mechanistic basis supporting an association.

In summary, while the clinical trials section (Section 6.1) does not explicitly mention AKI as an adverse reaction observed during pre-marketing clinical trials of daptomycin, post-marketing data (Section 6.2) include AKI as a reported adverse event. The specifics of these cases, including their frequency and any potential confirmation of causality, are not provided in the label. Therefore, while there is evidence suggesting an association between daptomycin use and AKI based on post-marketing reports, stronger, more systematic evidence from clinical trials is not available in the provided sections of the label.",NA
acute kidney injury,daratumumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for daratumumab (DARZALEX), there is no explicit evidence directly linking acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to daratumumab exposure. The sections provided do not mention acute kidney injury among the described adverse reactions, warnings, or postmarketing experiences. 

The adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) details various clinically significant adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in the clinical trials. Some of these include infusion-related reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory infections, and various infections, laboratory abnormalities (e.g., leukopenia, lymphopenia, and anemia), and infusion-related reactions such as anaphylactic reaction and infusion-related reactions leading to fatalities. However, there is no mention of acute kidney injury in this context.

Additionally, the warnings and precautions section (5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) covers several issues like infusion-related reactions, interference with serological testing, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, a potential impact on determining complete response due to the drug, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Yet, acute kidney injury is not listed as a concern within this part of the drug label either.

The postmarketing experience section (6.3 Postmarketing Experience) lists adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of daratumumab, such as anaphylactic reactions, infusion-related reactions, including deaths, pancreatitis, and infections like cytomegalovirus and listeriosis. However, acute kidney injury is not mentioned as a reported adverse event after market release.

In summary, according to the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between daratumumab exposure and acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. It is essential to refer to the most recent full prescribing information or consult a medical professional for the most updated information about daratumumab and its associated adverse effects.

acute kidney injury,dasatinib,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Associated with Dasatinib (Sprycel)

Dasatinib (marketed as Sprycel) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). While the drug label contains extensive information on various adverse reactions associated with dasatinib, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided label sections.

The provided sections of the drug label list the following adverse reactions and warnings:
- Myelosuppression
- Bleeding-related events
- Fluid retention
- Cardiovascular toxicity
- Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
- QT prolongation
- Severe dermatologic reactions
- Tumor lysis syndrome
- Effects on growth and development in pediatric patients
- Hepatotoxicity

Clinical trial data and post-marketing experience reported in the drug label include laboratory abnormalities related to myelosuppression, transaminase elevations, and other metabolic disturbances, but there is no specific mention of kidney injury, such as elevated creatinine levels or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which are typical markers of AKI.

Post-marketing surveillance as detailed in the label mentions nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, which can sometimes be associated with kidney injury. However, nephrotic syndrome is distinct from AKI and would not be considered synonymous evidence of AKI risk.

Upon reviewing the information provided, there is no explicitly stated evidence in these sections of the drug label that supports a direct relationship between dasatinib exposure and acute kidney injury. Clinical trials experience, adverse reaction reporting, and post-marketing data do not mention AKI as a known adverse effect of dasatinib within the information provided.

While the absence of specific mentions of AKI in the provided sections of the label does not completely exclude the possibility of dasatinib-induced AKI, any claims of such an association would require a detailed review of case reports, clinical studies, or pharmacovigilance databases not included with the provided information.

In summary, based on the information provided in the relevant sections of the drug label for dasatinib, there is no evidence to support the relationship between dasatinib and acute kidney injury. Further investigation would be necessary to conclusively determine if such an association exists. If investigating the potential relationship were clinically indicated, it would be advisable to conduct a comprehensive literature review and consult post-marketing surveillance data not provided in the label excerpts.",NA
acute kidney injury,decitabine,,"The provided drug label information for decitabine includes details on its adverse reactions from clinical trial experiences and postmarketing surveillance. However, there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. Below is a summary of the evidence or lack thereof concerning AKI as a potential adverse reaction to decitabine:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- In clinical trials (N = 66, N = 98, N = 99, N = 83 for decitabine), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>50%) were hematological toxicities like neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and nonspecific symptoms such as pyrexia.
- Adverse reactions that frequently led to clinical intervention or dose modification included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, infections, cardio-respiratory arrest, increased bilirubin, intracranial hemorrhage, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Detailed tables of adverse reactions presented for both single-arm and controlled trials do not list AKI as an observed reaction.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- The postmarketing experience provides additional adverse reactions reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. It is crucial to note that determining a clear frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure in these conditions is challenging due to the nature of voluntary reporting.
- Reported postmarketing adverse reactions include Sweet's syndrome, differentiation syndrome, and interstitial lung disease. Again, AKI is not mentioned among these reactions.

**Wider Literature Search:**
- Although not provided in the drug label, a broader literature search might identify case reports or observational studies that suggest an association between decitabine and AKI. It is important that healthcare providers report any such suspected adverse reactions to regulatory authorities like the FDA to ensure ongoing safety surveillance.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label information for decitabine, there is no evidence from clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance directly associating decitabine with acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. It is possible that AKI could be a rare or underreported adverse reaction, but such an association cannot be confirmed without specific data supporting such claims.",NA
acute kidney injury,deferasirox,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and deferasirox exposure is documented in clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. The information from the drug label indicates that AKI, including cases requiring dialysis and instances of renal tubular toxicity such as Fanconi syndrome, were observed and discussed in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.1, 5.6). 

Clinical Trial Evidence:
- In premarketing studies, deferasirox was given to 700 pediatric and adult patients for 48 weeks. Adverse reactions related to renal function – specifically increases in serum creatinine – were among the most frequently reported (Table 1). Instances of AKI were not explicitly mentioned in your summary, but renal adverse reactions such as increased serum creatinine levels can be indicative of kidney injury.
- In Study 1, 38% of deferasirox-treated patients had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2). Some patients required dose reductions due to these increases.
- In pediatric patients from a nested case control analysis within a pooled clinical trial dataset, there was a 26% increased risk of AKI with each 5 mg/kg/day increase in deferasirox dose starting at 20 mg/kg/day.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- Acute renal failure and tubulointerstitial nephritis have been reported as spontaneous post-approval adverse reactions during deferasirox use in the patient population with transfusional iron overload. As these are voluntarily reported cases, the exact incidence rate is uncertain, but the association is recognized.
- A 5-year observational study involving 267 pediatric patients showed that 48% had a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥33% observed at least once, which is consistent with kidney injury.

Warnings and Precautions from the Label:
- Deferasirox has a boxed warning emphasizing the risk of AKI, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. It specifically states that deferasirox may cause acute kidney injury, including cases severe enough to require dialysis.
- The Warnings and Precautions (5.1) section explicitly states that deferasirox is not to be used in patients with an eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2 due to the risk of acute kidney injury and renal failure.
- Regular monitoring of renal function is recommended for all patients receiving deferasirox, with closer monitoring for those with pre-existing kidney issues or those at increased risk of renal dysfunction.

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data to support the relationship between AKI and deferasirox exposure. Clinicians are advised to monitor kidney function regularly in patients receiving deferasirox and to adjust dosage as necessary to mitigate this risk.",NA
acute kidney injury,deferoxamine,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to deferoxamine, an iron chelating agent, is documented within the drug's label under both 'Adverse Reactions' and 'Warnings and Precautions'.

In section 6, 'Adverse Reactions', it is noted that renal toxicity has been observed in patients treated with deferoxamine. The document specifically cites acute renal failure, increased serum creatinine levels, and renal tubular disorders as adverse reactions that have been associated with the use of the drug. These events have been identified through clinical trials or post-marking reports, although the exact frequency of these adverse events is challenging to estimate due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports and the uncertainty regarding the size of the exposed population.

Additionally, section 5.3, 'Warnings and Precautions', further emphasizes renal toxicity as a serious concern by stating that renal toxicity, which includes increases in serum creatinine—sometimes possibly dose-related—acute renal failure, and renal tubular disorders have occurred in patients taking deferoxamine. The label indicates that serum creatinine should be monitored to assess changes in renal function in patients treated with the drug, highlighting the potential risk of renal adverse effects directly tied to the use of deferoxamine.

While neither the clinical trial data nor post-marketing studies are detailed in the provided text, the inclusion of renal toxicity, including AKI, within the drug's official labeling suggests that regulatory agencies have recognized a significant body of evidence linking deferoxamine to these renal adverse reactions. This evidence would have been derived from clinical trial observations, adverse reaction reports, and possibly case studies in the post-marketing setting, providing a basis for the warnings and precautions included in the drug labeling.

The drug label serves as a formal acknowledgment by both the manufacturer and regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that AKI is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the exposure to deferoxamine, based on the synthesis of available scientific and clinical evidence up to the date of the label's most recent revision. It should be noted that this summary is based on the sections provided from the drug label, and a more comprehensive review of additional research literature would be necessary for a detailed analysis of all available evidence.",NA
acute kidney injury,defibrotide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for DEFITELIO, acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. The document focuses primarily on hemorrhage and hypersensitivity reactions as significant adverse reactions and warnings.

The clinical trials section (6.1) mentions that the safety of DEFITELIO was evaluated in 176 adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) with pulmonary and/or renal dysfunction following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with significant acute bleeding, active graft-versus-host disease (grades B-D), or requiring multiple vasopressors were excluded from these trials. Of note, at study entry, 13% of the patients were dialysis-dependent, which may suggest pre-existing renal impairment. However, the document does not specify whether acute kidney injury occurred as a direct adverse reaction to DEFITELIO during the course of the treatment.

Adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials were primarily related to hemorrhage events, with hypotension being the most common serious adverse reaction (11%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of DEFITELIO in some patients included various types of hemorrhages and multi-organ failure, but acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as a reason for discontinuation.

In summary, based on the information provided from the selected sections of the drug label, there is no specified evidence that directly supports a relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to DEFITELIO. It may be important to review additional sources, such as full clinical trial data, case reports, or broader post-marketing surveillance, to identify any potential reports of acute kidney injury related to DEFITELIO use that are not included in this document. If these sources do not provide clear evidence of such a relationship, it may be concluded that there is no known evidence supporting acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to DEFITELIO based on the provided label sections.",NA
acute kidney injury,delafloxacin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data for delafloxacin (BAXDELA). Delafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).

The adverse reactions section and clinical trials experience indicate that the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2%) observed in patients treated with BAXDELA across all Phase 3 trials were nausea, diarrhea, headache, transaminase elevations, and vomiting. Serious adverse reactions reported were less than 1% and primarily involved hypersensitivity and skin-related issues. In the safety evaluation of BAXDELA, renal-related adverse events included renal impairment and renal failure, but these were reported with a frequency of less than 2%.

On evaluating the laboratory investigations section, there is a mention of ""blood creatinine increased"", which could be an indicator of impaired kidney function; however, this is not explicitly characterized as acute kidney injury and the rate of occurrence is not specified.

Warnings and precautions detailed in the label sections discuss the risk of serious adverse reactions including tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, hypersensitivity reactions, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, among others. However, there is no direct warning or precaution relating to AKI.

To summarize, based on the information from the drug label provided, there is no direct evidence linking delafloxacin with acute kidney injury as a frequent or well-characterized adverse reaction in the context of clinical trials or post-marketing experience. If such a relationship has been observed in practice, it may be at a very low incidence or not sufficiently documented to be included in the labeling. In cases like this, healthcare providers may report AKI as a suspected adverse reaction through post-marketing surveillance systems such as the FDA MedWatch program to contribute to the body of evidence and potential label updates in the future.","NA
"
acute kidney injury,demeclocycline,,"Based on the drug label information provided for demeclocycline, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between demeclocycline exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury. Specifically, the label mentions ""Renal toxicity: Acute renal failure. Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related."" This indicates that cases of acute renal failure have been observed in patients taking demeclocycline and that the likelihood of renal toxicity, including a rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), is related to the dosage of the drug. 

While the drug label does not detail specific clinical trials, the inclusion of acute renal failure in the adverse reactions suggests that there has been a noted occurrence of this condition in the context of the drug's usage. Furthermore, the drug label is part of the regulatory documentation, which is based on both clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance evidence. Thus, the label serves as a summary of known adverse effects identified during the clinical development of demeclocycline and from reports collected after the drug was marketed.

However, the provided drug label does not include specifics about the incidence of acute kidney injury, nor does it provide comprehensive details such as the patient population affected, the severity of the renal injury, or the time to onset following demeclocycline administration. If more detailed evidence is required, an in-depth literature search including clinical studies, case reports, and post-marketing analysis would be necessary.

To conclude, there is documented evidence within the provided drug label that supports a relationship between demeclocycline exposure and the adverse reaction of acute kidney injury, with a note on its dose dependency. Additional detail on this relationship would require a review of the clinical trial data, case studies, and other sources of post-marketing surveillance data not provided in this summary.",NA
acute kidney injury,dexlansoprazole,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the exposure to dexlansoprazole is detailed in section 5.2 of the provided drug label, which mentions Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (TIN) as an observed serious adverse reaction. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is a known cause of acute kidney injury and involves the inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures.

Clinical Trials Experience:
In the clinical trials mentioned in section 6.1 of the drug label, involving a safety evaluation of dexlansoprazole with 4,548 adult patients, there is no explicit mention of AKI being observed as a common adverse reaction directly. The common adverse reactions were diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, and flatulence, with no direct reference to renal-related adverse effects.

Postmarketing Experience:
Section 6.2 of the drug label addresses the adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of dexlansoprazole, which are voluntarily reported. Under ""Renal and Urinary Disorders,"" it specifies ""acute renal failure"" as an adverse reaction observed in the postmarketing period. While these voluntary reports may suggest an association, they do not provide the same level of evidence as controlled clinical trials due to the lack of a comparator group and potential reporting biases.

Warnings and Precautions:
Section 5.2 of the drug label provides more specific information on the risk of acute TIN associated with dexlansoprazole use. It states that Acute TIN has been observed in patients taking PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors) and it may occur at any time during therapy. The section highlights the serious nature of this adverse reaction and the importance of discontinuing treatment with dexlansoprazole if TIN is suspected based on patient presentation with symptoms ranging from hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific decreases in renal function.

Conclusion:
The label for dexlansoprazole includes Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis in the section on Warnings and Precautions, indicating that there have been observed cases and there is a recognized risk of this condition, which can lead to acute kidney injury. No specific incidence rate is provided, and the knowledge about this adverse reaction appears to be based on case reports and the known pharmacologic class effects of PPIs, rather than controlled clinical trial data. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of acute renal failure during the use of dexlansoprazole, providing further, albeit less rigorous, support for the adverse reaction. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor for signs and symptoms of TIN and manage patients accordingly.",NA
acute kidney injury,dexmedetomidine,,"The information provided from the drug label for dexmedetomidine does not specifically report acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The drug label details a list of adverse reactions that have been observed, which include hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth as the most common (incidence >2%) in adult patients.

In terms of renal-related adverse effects, the label does mention oliguria (a decrease in urine output) occurring in less than 1% of the adult patients in ICU sedation studies (Table 3), and oliguria reported during the post-marketing experience, which points to the possibility of renal function alteration. However, its low incidence does not strongly establish a prevalent relationship with acute kidney injury.

Additionally, in the key treatment-emergent adverse events table for long-term ICU sedation (Table 5), renal failure acute occurred in 2% of the dexmedetomidine group compared to 1% in the midazolam group, which again could suggest a potential association with renal impairment, but the evidence does not specifically highlight acute kidney injury as a direct and common adverse reaction.

It is worth noting that the label advises caution in patients with compromised renal function (as part of the hypotension warning in section 5.2), but this is more so due to the potential for hypotension, which can secondarily affect renal perfusion, rather than direct nephrotoxic effects of dexmedetomidine.

In conclusion, while the drug label indicates that dexmedetomidine may have some impact on renal function, as evidenced by reports of oliguria and acute renal failure in a small percentage of patients, there is no explicit or strong evidence linking dexmedetomidine to acute kidney injury as a direct and common adverse reaction. Careful monitoring of renal function during dexmedetomidine use is warranted, especially in patients with pre-existing renal conditions or other risk factors for kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,diclofenac,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been documented as a potential adverse reaction to diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The evidence supporting the link between diclofenac exposure and the development of AKI derives from multiple sources, including clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

From the provided drug label sections, renal toxicity is acknowledged under both the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" and ""WARNINGS"" categories. Notably, the label lists ""abnormal renal function,"" ""interstitial nephritis,"" ""oliguria/polyuria,"" ""proteinuria,"" and ""renal failure"" as reported adverse effects, which are related to kidney function and could be involved in the onset of AKI. These adverse reactions are not necessarily common, but their inclusion indicates that kidney-related issues have been observed in individuals taking diclofenac.

Clinical Trials Experience:
While the drug label does not quantify the incidence rate of AKI specifically, it mentions abnormal renal function as a reported adverse event in approximately 1%-10% of patients taking diclofenac. It is important to note that clinical trials are highly controlled environments, and the rates and patterns of adverse reactions documented during trials might not fully represent those seen in broader clinical practice.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing surveillance, which captures data after a drug is released on the market, has identified instances of AKI as a suspected adverse event in patients using diclofenac. The surveillance typically involves voluntary reporting of adverse events, and as such, the rates may be underreported. However, the mention of ""renal failure"" in the drug label's section on adverse events suggests that post-marketing data has linked diclofenac to serious kidney-related outcomes.

Case Studies:
Although not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections, case studies in the medical literature have reported AKI in the context of diclofenac use. These reports often outline individual instances where patients develop AKI after taking diclofenac, typically identifying a temporal relationship between drug exposure and the onset of kidney injury.

Overall, the combination of clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and case studies provides evidence supporting an association between acute kidney injury and diclofenac exposure. Physicians prescribing diclofenac are advised to be cautious of this potential risk and monitor renal function, especially in patients who have pre-existing renal impairment or other risk factors for AKI.

To obtain more detailed information and quantitative data on the incidence of AKI associated with diclofenac, one may consider reviewing clinical trial databases, case report repositories, and pharmacovigilance data sources.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute kidney injury is included as a potential adverse reaction of diclofenac within the ""Urogenital System"" category where ""renal failure"" is mentioned. Given this information, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and diclofenac exposure as per the label. Therefore, adverse reactions can indeed be related to the drug according to the manufacturer's own reporting."
acute kidney injury,dicloxacillin,,"The drug label sections provided mention renal adverse reactions in the context of penicillinase-resistant penicillins, with renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis being associated with the administration of methicillin and, less frequently, with nafcillin and oxacillin. Although dicloxacillin, which is in the same class of antibiotics, is not explicitly named in these adverse reactions, given its similar mechanism of action and class effects, it could potentially have similar renal risks.

However, the label does not specify acute kidney injury (AKI) directly as an adverse reaction for dicloxacillin. Methicillin-induced nephropathy, a type of kidney injury, is described as generally reversible with prompt discontinuation of therapy and does not appear to be dose-related. This indicates that while there is a suggestion of nephrotoxic potential inherent to this class of antibiotics, the specific association between AKI and dicloxacillin is not clearly established in the provided label sections.

Beyond the drug label, it is important to consider evidence from other sources like clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance to obtain a comprehensive picture of the relationship between dicloxacillin and acute kidney injury:

1. Clinical Trials: No specific clinical trial results are provided here to establish a direct link between dicloxacillin and AKI. In the absence of such data, we cannot make a definitive statement about the evidence from clinical trials supporting this relationship.

2. Case Studies: The provided drug label does not include details from case studies pertaining to dicloxacillin-induced AKI. Case studies could be a source of information on rare or previously unrecognized adverse drug reactions but would have to be sought out in the scientific literature for confirmation.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: While the label mentions receiving reports of renal reactions during post-marketing surveillance of related drugs (methicillin, nafcillin, and oxacillin), it does not present specific post-marketing data regarding dicloxacillin and AKI. Post-marketing surveillance often identifies adverse reactions that were not detected during clinical trials due to the broader and more diverse population exposed to the drug post-approval.

In summary, the evidence provided from the drug label sections suggests a possible association between penicillinase-resistant penicillins and kidney-related adverse reactions, but it does not establish a direct and specific link between dicloxacillin and acute kidney injury. Available evidence from the label is indirect and primarily concerns other drugs within the same class. To conclusively determine the relationship between dicloxacillin exposure and AKI, a review of case reports, clinical trials, and additional post-marketing data would be necessary. If no such reviews or reported cases are available, then the statement can be made that no known evidence supports this relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,didanosine,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for didanosine, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in the adverse reactions (6), warnings, and box warnings sections. The drug label does detail numerous adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, such as pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, hepatic toxicity, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, peripheral neuropathy, and others, all of which are discussed in different sections and in varying levels of detail. Acute kidney injury is not highlighted among them.

Evidence from clinical trial experience only reports adverse reactions such as diarrhea, peripheral neurologic symptoms/neuropathy, nausea, headache, rash, vomiting, and pancreatitis. Additionally, notable laboratory abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT), hyperlipasemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Acute kidney injury is not listed as a laboratory abnormality or a direct adverse reaction in these trials.

Post-marketing experience also does not explicitly list acute kidney injury but does mention adverse reactions like rhabdomyolysis, which may include acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. It is important to note that such cases may indirectly point to the potential for kidney injury, but a clear, direct association of acute kidney injury with the administration of didanosine is not established in the provided information.

In summary, according to the drug label information provided, there is no direct evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and didanosine exposure based on clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. If acute kidney injury is a concern or suspected, it would likely be categorized under a broader heading not specifically stated or it is a rare occurrence not captured in the listed adverse reactions or warnings for didanosine. Always consult with healthcare professionals for comprehensive safety information and for further evaluation of risk factors, especially if renal impairment is observed.",NA
acute kidney injury,diflunisal,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for diflunisal, there is evidence to support the relationship between acute kidney injury and diflunisal exposure. The section of adverse reactions lists ""renal impairment, including renal failure; interstitial nephritis; hematuria; proteinuria"" as events that were reported in clinical trials or since the drug was marketed with a probability existing of a causal relationship between diflunisal and these adverse reactions. 

Renal impairment and renal failure are terms that can encompass acute kidney injury, and interstitial nephritis is a known cause of acute kidney injury. Thus, the inclusion of these terms indicates that diflunisal has been associated with renal adverse reactions that could manifest as acute kidney injury.

These adverse reactions were reported at an incidence less than 1 in 100, which suggests they are relatively uncommon but recognized occurrences. Post-marketing surveillance appears to be the source of some of this information, as these are reactions that were reported since the drug was marketed. 

Further evidence of the risks to renal function is apparent in the WARNINGS section, which generally discusses the potential for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including diflunisal, to cause serious adverse events. While the sections provided primarily focus on gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks, the acknowledgment of serious adverse events suggests a broader potential for harm, which can include renal effects.

In summary, the evidence from the drug label points to a relationship between acute kidney injury and diflunisal, with renal-related adverse reactions listed as occurring in less than 1% of clinical trial subjects or from reports collected post-marketing. The causal relationship between these adverse reactions and diflunisal use is supported by the information in the label, but the low incidence indicates that these are not the most common side effects of the medication.",NA
acute kidney injury,diltiazem,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) being associated with diltiazem use in either the listed adverse reactions from clinical studies, the warnings, or the post-marketing surveillance data.

The adverse reactions section lists various potential side effects noticed in clinical studies with their corresponding frequencies, covering a range of systems such as cardiovascular, nervous system, gastrointestinal, and dermatological, but AKI is not mentioned. Similarly, for post-marketing events, although various reactions such as allergic reactions and hematologic abnormalities are reported, AKI is not specifically cited.

Furthermore, the warning sections discuss cardiac conduction abnormalities and potential acute hepatic injury, again without indicating a relationship with AKI. In the absence of specific references to AKI as a known adverse reaction in these sections, it can be inferred that there is no established evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance captured in this labeling information that directly associates AKI with the administration of diltiazem.

However, the absence of any known association in the provided labeling does not entirely rule out the possibility of AKI as an adverse effect. It might be an extremely rare event, not sufficiently documented, or it may be observed and reported post the knowledge cutoff for this drug label. Therefore, healthcare professionals are often encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to further refine the safety profile of drugs.

In summary, based on the drug label sections provided, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and diltiazem exposure. Healthcare providers should continuously monitor for new safety information and report any adverse events to appropriate channels.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to diltiazem. The listed adverse reactions range from more common events like edema, headache, and dizziness, to infrequent cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, nervous system, dermatological, and other systemic reactions. Additionally, postmarketing events include a variety of reactions, but acute kidney injury is not specifically reported. Therefore, there is no available evidence in the provided text to assess or refute a relationship between acute kidney injury and diltiazem exposure. If such evidence exists outside the provided label, it has not been included for review in this assessment."
acute kidney injury,docetaxel,,"The provided sections of the drug label for docetaxel (Taxotere) include detailed information about various adverse reactions identified through clinical trials and postmarketing experience, but acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed among them. Potential adverse reactions described include hematologic effects such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, along with hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, infections, and various organ-specific toxicities.

Given the lack of specific mention of acute kidney injury in these sections of the labeling, there is no direct evidence in the provided label information that AKI is an adverse reaction of docetaxel. However, the absence of an adverse reaction in a label does not exclude the possibility of its occurrence. To definitively determine whether AKI is a potential adverse reaction to docetaxel, further investigation into clinical research literature, additional case studies, and continued post-marketing surveillance data would be required.

If acute kidney injury has been observed and reported in association with docetaxel use outside the scope of the data provided, that information would be necessary to determine the strength of the relationship between docetaxel exposure and AKI. Without this information, we can state that according to the provided drug label sections, AKI is not a recognized adverse reaction of docetaxel. It should be noted that this analysis only covers the information provided and is not a comprehensive review of all available data on docetaxel.",NA
acute kidney injury,dolasetron,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ANZEMET (dolasetron), acute kidney injury is indeed mentioned as a potential adverse reaction, although with a low frequency. Here's a concise summary of the evidence:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The drug label indicates that during controlled clinical trials involving adult cancer patients, the following renal-related adverse event was reported in less than 2% of patients: acute renal failure. These trials largely consisted of patients undergoing chemotherapy, particularly with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin regimens. It should be noted that ""acute renal failure"" is the clinical terminology often used synonymously with ""acute kidney injury.""

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
No additional information regarding acute kidney injury is provided from post-marketing surveillance in the provided sections of the drug label.

The mention of acute renal failure as an adverse event suggests that there has been at least some observed association between dolasetron use and kidney injury. However, without access to comprehensive data from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance reports, the strength of this association and the incidence rate cannot be accurately ascertained. It's also important to consider confounding factors, such as the potential nephrotoxic effects of the chemotherapy agents themselves.

Since acute kidney injury appears in the adverse events section related to treatment with dolasetron, albeit infrequently, this indicates that there is evidence to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to the drug based on the results observed in clinical trials. No specific box warnings or general warnings related to acute kidney injury are included in the provided sections of the label.

In summary, based on the available label information, there is evidence from clinical trials that suggests a potential association between dolasetron and acute kidney model, which appears to be a rare adverse event. Further studies or post-marketing surveillance reports would be helpful to better characterize this relationship. For healthcare providers and patients, this information should be considered in the context of the patient's overall health status, renal function, and concomitant medications, particularly nephrotoxic agents.",NA
acute kidney injury,dolutegravir,,"Based on the detailed information provided from clinical trial data, it is evident that acute kidney injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction in patients treated with dolutegravir (TIVICAY). In the sections provided, which include adverse reactions from clinical trials in different populations (treatment-naïve, treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed, and pediatric subjects), post-marketing experience, and various warnings and precautions, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse effect. 

The renal-related adverse reactions that are mentioned include ""renal impairment"" under the ""less common adverse reactions observed in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced trials,"" with a note that this occurred in less than 2% of subjects in any one trial. Additionally, there were laboratory abnormalities related to serum creatinine, which was reported to increase due to dolutegravir’s inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. This increase in serum creatinine was noted to occur within the first four weeks of treatment and remained stable through 96 weeks. These findings do not indicate a direct relationship to acute kidney injury, but rather a pharmacologic effect on creatinine levels, which is not equivalent to renal impairment or injury.

Moreover, acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction does not appear in the postmarketing experience section, indicating that, up to the knowledge cutoff date, there has not been a signal from real-world data to suggest a causal link between dolutegravir exposure and acute kidney injury.

In conclusion, the available clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance do not provide evidence to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and the use of dolutegravir. However, this does not rule out the need for clinicians to be vigilant for any potential renal adverse effects, given that ""renal impairment"" has been reported infrequently, and serum creatinine increases occur due to the drug’s mechanism of action. Monitoring renal function as part of the management of patients on dolutegravir is warranted, especially in individuals with pre-existing renal conditions or other risk factors for kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,dolutegravir,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing experience sections for dolutegravir, marketed as TIVICAY. The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity in treatment-naïve subjects receiving TIVICAY were insomnia, fatigue, and headache, with an incidence of at least 2% in any one adult trial.

The safety assessment of TIVICAY in clinical trials, such as SPRING-2, SINGLE, FLAMINGO, SAILING, VIKING-3, and the SWORD studies, noted adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, but AKI was not listed among them. It is important to mention that renal impairment is listed among the less common adverse reactions observed in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects, but no specific mention of acute kidney injury is made.

In terms of laboratory abnormalities, changes in serum creatinine were observed and noted to be due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine by dolutegravir without affecting renal glomerular function. This indicates an impact on renal markers without direct evidence of AKI.

The post-marketing experience section also does not list AKI as a reported adverse reaction following the use of TIVICAY. Adverse reactions from post-marketing experiences include acute liver failure, hepatotoxicity, weight increase, arthralgia, myalgia, and anxiety, but there is no mention of acute kidney injury.

In summary, based on the cited sections of the drug label for dolutegravir (TIVICAY), there is no available evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking the use of dolutegravir to the occurrence of acute kidney injury. Renal impairment is noted as a less common adverse reaction without further specificity, and while serum creatinine increases have been observed, they are attributed to the drug effect on tubular secretion rather than direct renal injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,donepezil,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for donepezil hydrochloride, there is no explicit evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) being an adverse reaction associated with this medication. The labeled adverse reactions, as well as warnings and precautions, mainly describe the cholinomimetic effects of the drug and do not mention renal complications such as AKI.

Clinical trials, as summarized in the drug label, have documented adverse reactions including nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia as the most common ones. These reactions are related to donepezil hydrochloride's action as a cholinesterase inhibitor. Adverse reactions led to the discontinuation of donepezil hydrochloride treatment in some cases, but AKI was not identified as a reason for discontinuation or as a reported adverse reaction.

In the post-marketing experience, donepezil hydrochloride has been associated with a range of adverse reactions, including abdominal pain, confusion, convulsions, and cardiac conditions. However, AKI is not listed among the post-marketing adverse reactions, suggesting that if AKI has occurred, it has not been reported at a frequency or with a causality that warrants its inclusion in these sections of the label.

To conclude, there is no known evidence within the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance as provided in the drug label sections that supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and donepezil hydrochloride exposure. If this potential adverse reaction has been observed, it has not been documented to a degree that it is considered an established adverse effect of the drug. Healthcare professionals and researchers may consider surveillance for any emerging data regarding AKI and donepezil use, especially considering the elderly population being treated may be at an increased risk for renal complications.",NA
acute kidney injury,dotatate,,"In the provided drug label sections, there is evidence supporting the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and drug exposure to Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate). This evidence comes from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences. I will summarize the key points below:

Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
- The data reflects exposure to Lutathera in patients with advanced, progressive midgut neuroendocrine tumors from the NETTER-1 trial and additional patient data from an ERASMUS trial.
- In NETTER-1, among patients receiving Lutathera with octreotide, there were renal-related events that led to discontinuation of Lutathera in five patients. Specifically, renal failure (which includes AKI) was reported in 13% for all grades and 4% for Grades 3-4 adverse reactions compared to the control group. 

Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
- During post-approval use of Lutathera, acute kidney injury has been reported. However, the frequency is uncertain due to the voluntary nature of reporting and inability to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure definitively.

Warnings and Precautions (Sections 5.4):
- The ERASMUS trial data indicated renal failure, including AKI, occurred in less than 1% of patients 3 to 36 months following exposure to Lutathera. Among these patients, some had underlying renal impairment or risk factors for renal failure and required dialysis.
- Patients are advised to hydrate and urinate frequently to mitigate renal toxicity risks, which is a recognition of the potential for AKI.
- Monitoring of serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance is recommended before dosing and as needed after administration of Lutathera to monitor for signs of renal toxicity.

The available evidence demonstrates that there is an established risk of AKI with the use of Lutathera, based on both clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance. Precautionary steps are recommended to minimize the risk and manage the potential side effects. This encompasses patient selection, monitoring renal function, and patient education about hydration. Clinicians are advised to use caution particularly in patients with baseline renal impairment who may be at increased risk of toxicity. 

Source:
- The drug label sections provided on Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate).","Given the sections provided from the drug label, there is evidence indicating that renal toxicity, including renal failure, is a recognized adverse reaction of Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (LUTATHERA). Specifically, renal failure is listed as an adverse reaction within the clinical trials experience (Table 4 of Section 6.1) and ERASMUS trial results, where renal failure was reported in 2% of the patients (Section 6.1). Additionally, in Section 5.4 (Warnings and Precautions) renal toxicity is explicitly mentioned, with advice on monitoring the serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance, suggesting that renal impairment is a risk associated with LUTATHERA.

Therefore, based on the drug label information provided, it is not accurate to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury or renal toxicity and LUTATHERA; in fact, the evidence supports such a relationship. The label recommends specific protocols to mitigate this risk, indicating that renal function should be carefully monitored in patients who receive this drug.

NA (Not Applicable) is not an appropriate response to your request, as the evidence does not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and LUTATHERA—it supports it."
acute kidney injury,dulaglutide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and dulaglutide, a medication used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, can be inferred from various sections of the drug label reflective of clinical trial experiences and post-marketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trials Experience**

The prescribing information lists acute kidney injury under the Warnings and Precautions section (5.5). It states that there have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis, particularly in patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, the class of drugs that includes dulaglutide. However, the label also notes that a majority of these events occurred in patients who had experienced severe gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration, which can, independently of drug exposure, lead to AKI.

The information also specifies that AKI may be more likely to occur when initiating or escalating doses of dulaglutide in patients with renal impairment. Patients are advised to monitor renal function, especially when presenting with severe gastrointestinal reactions. Clinical trials are referenced, but specific incidence rates or detailed information about AKI within these studies are not provided in the sections provided, which means either that AKI was not a focal adverse event in the trials or that it was not commonly observed.

**Postmarketing Experience**

The postmarketing experience section (6.2) does explicitly mention AKI. This points toward evidence of AKI associated with dulaglutide arising from real-world use after the drug was approved and available on the market. Often, certain adverse effects are better identified through postmarketing surveillance as this can capture longer-term use and a broader, more diverse patient population that wasn't necessarily represented in clinical trials.

Although the drug label indicates that AKI has been reported, it does not provide specific data or incidence rates based on postmarketing surveillance. Furthermore, it doesn't establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary nature of reports and the unknown size of the exposed population.

**Summary**

There is a warning within the prescribing information suggesting a relationship between the use of dulaglutide and acute kidney injury, primarily based on postmarketing reports. However, due to limitations in this evidence, such as a lack of specificity and causality, it is not possible to conclusively state the frequency or direct link of AKI to dulaglutide exposure. Clinical trials do not seem to directly highlight AKI as a frequent adverse reaction in comparison to other side effects. It is also worth considering that contributory factors such as severe dehydration resulting from gastrointestinal reactions may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AKI in these scenarios. 

Therefore, while there is some evidence to suggest a relationship between AKI and dulaglutide, it is relatively limited and derived from postmarketing surveillance data, which requires careful interpretation and further investigation to establish causality. It is recommended to monitor renal function in at-risk patients as a precaution.",NA
acute kidney injury,dulaglutide,,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Kidney Injury Adverse Reaction to Dulaglutide:**

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been identified as a potential adverse reaction in patients treated with dulaglutide, which is known by the brand name Trulicity. Dulaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The sources of evidence for AKI as an adverse reaction include clinical trial data, postmarketing experience, and the drug's prescribing information.

1. **Clinical Trials:**
   The prescribing information for Trulicity, specifically in section 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience), does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction from the clinical trials in the pooled analysis for the adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of treated adults included gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Moreover, these gastrointestinal reactions can lead to dehydration, which may contribute to renal impairment.

2. **Postmarketing Surveillance:**
   Acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis, has been reported in the postmarketing experience with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including dulaglutide. Section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) of the prescribing information notes that some reports occurred in patients without known underlying renal disease, and many were associated with severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can lead to volume depletion and acute kidney injury.

3. **Prescribing Information Warnings:**
   Section 5.5 (Acute Kidinary Injury) of the prescribing information warns about the potential for AKI, especially in patients experiencing severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions, which may worsen renal function. It advises caution when initiating or escalating doses of Trulicity in patients with renal impairment and monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe gastrointestinal reactions.

**Conclusions:**
While acute kidney injury is not reported as a direct adverse reaction from the pooled clinical trials data available in the Trulicity prescribing information, there is an acknowledged risk of AKI in the postmarketing experience and within the drug's warning sections. These warnings likely stem from observed cases and the physiological understanding that severe gastrointestinal effects can indirectly lead to AKI through dehydration and volume depletion. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor renal function in patients treated with dulaglutide who present with severe gastrointestinal adverse events or have existing renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,durvalumab,,"The provided drug label information for durvalumab (IMFINZI) extensively details the clinical trials experience, adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with its use. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly mentioned in the adverse reactions or warnings for durvalumab as observed in the provided sections of the label.

From the provided information, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction are identified as potential immune-mediated adverse reactions related to the administration of durvalumab, both as a single agent and in various combinations with other therapeutic agents or chemotherapy:

1. IMFINZI as a Single Agent: Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.5% (10/1889) of patients, with some instances leading to permanent discontinuation and requiring systemic corticosteroids.

2. IMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl: Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 1% (4/388) of patients, with systemic corticosteroids required for all affected patients.

3. IMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy: Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.7% (4/596) of patients.

It is important to note that immune-mediated nephritis can lead to renal dysfunction, which may be a clinical manifestation of AKI. AKI itself can be a severe expression of renal dysfunction; however, the label does not explicitly confirm AKI as a reported condition.

In summary, while the drug label includes immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction as potential adverse reactions to durvalumab, it does not explicitly list acute kidney injury. Further evidence, such as published case reports or post-marketing surveillance data, would be necessary to establish a direct link between durvalumab and AKI. If such evidence exists beyond the provided sections of the label, it has not been included in this summary. Healthcare providers should report any suspected cases of AKI or other serious adverse events to pharmacovigilance systems to ensure ongoing monitoring of drug safety.",NA
acute kidney injury,duvelisib,,"The evidence provided does not specifically list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance for duvelisib (COPIKTRA). Duvelisib has been associated with various adverse reactions, including infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions, pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, and neutropenia, as described in the clinical trial experience and warnings sections of the prescribing information.

In terms of renal effects, the available safety data from the clinical trial experience of duvelisib mentioned treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities, such as increased creatinine levels, which occurred in 24% of patients. However, the grade ≥ 3 creatinine increase was reported in 2% of patients, which may suggest potential kidney-related issues but not necessarily classified as AKI.

Due to the renal function inclusion criteria for the trials (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal), patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment were likely excluded, which could potentially limit observations of AKI during the trials.

Another point to consider is that serious adverse reactions included renal insufficiency in a subset of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), indicating that renal function may be affected in a small percentage of patients treated with duvelisib.

In conclusion, while the available clinical trial information and label warnings do not explicitly state AKI as a known adverse reaction to duvelisib, there is evidence of increased creatinine in a subset of patients, indicating that some degree of renal impairment, potentially including AKI, may be a concern. It is advisable for clinicians to monitor renal function in patients treated with duvelisib and consider this risk in the context of other potential risk factors for AKI that the patient may have.",NA
acute kidney injury,eculizumab,,"Summary of Evidence: Acute Kidney Injury and Eculizumab

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potential adverse event that may be associated with the use of eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the complement system and is marketed under the name SOLIRIS. The evidence supporting a relationship between AKI and eculizumab use arises from data collected in clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and case studies. Below is a summary of the evidence, drawn from the relevant sections of the drug labeling and other sources referenced, if applicable.

1. Clinical Trials:
   - The safety of SOLIRIS (eculizumab) therapy in patients with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS) was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies in adult and pediatric patients, and one retrospective study. Renal-related adverse reactions reported included hypertension, renal impairment, proteinuria, and chronic renal failure. (Table 5).
   - In these aHUS studies, serious adverse events (SAEs) included infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%). Five patients discontinued SOLIRIS due to adverse events, three of whom did so due to worsening renal function (one due to a new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis).

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   - Besides the adverse reactions identified in clinical studies, additional adverse reactions have been noted during post-approval use of SOLIRIS. The label mentions fatal or serious infections caused by Neisseria species but does not list post-marketing adverse reactions specifically related to AKI.

3. Case Studies and Other Reports:
   - No specific case studies or reports indicating a direct relationship between AKI and eculizumab use have been included in the provided text sections. Additional searches in scientific literature databases would be required to locate case reports and observational studies that could provide further insights.

Evaluation:
The available evidence from clinical trials involving patients with aHUS suggests that there is a relationship between the administration of eculizumab and the occurrence of renal impairment, including AKI. The serious adverse events reported in the aHUS clinical studies demonstrate renal-related complications, and the label explicitly lists renal impairment and chronic renal failure as observed serious adverse events in these trials. However, the existing post-marketing surveillance data provided does not explicitly state AKI as a post-marketing adverse reaction; thus, additional vigilance and reporting mechanisms may be necessary to elucidate the full extent of this potential adverse reaction.

The label's Warnings and Precautions also indicate increased susceptibility to infections and suggest monitoring disease manifestations including renal function after discontinuing SOLIRIS, which could be an indirect acknowledgment of the drug’s potential to affect renal health.

To make a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of AKI with eculizumab, detailed reporting of post-marketing adverse events, further clinical trial data analysis, and systematic reviews of case reports would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,elotuzumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction in patients treated with elotuzumab, also known as EMPLICITI. However, in the summary of the ELOQUENT-2 clinical trial, there is a brief mention that serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of patients treated on the EMPLICITI arm and 57% for patients treated on the control arm. Among the listed serious adverse reactions, acute renal failure (which could encompass AKI) was reported in 2.5% of patients treated with elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, compared to 1.9% in the control arm that received lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.

In summary, while AKI is not listed as one of the most common adverse reactions, there is some evidence from the ELOQUENT-2 trial that suggests a potential association with elotuzumab treatment. Acute renal failure, which may include AKI, was reported at a slightly higher incidence in the treatment group that included elotuzumab compared to the control group. It is important to consider that in clinical trials, the inclusion of an event as an adverse reaction does not necessarily prove causality but suggests a possible association to be further evaluated.

Outside of this data point, the excerpts do not provide additional evidence from case studies or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking elotuzumab to an increased risk of AKI. 

For healthcare providers, monitoring kidney function as part of the overall patient assessment during treatment with elotuzumab may be advisable, given the reported incidence of acute renal failure in the clinical trial. Any concerns about kidney injury should be explored further, considering the patient’s overall health, concomitant medications, and underlying disease states that might also contribute to renal complications.","In the provided detailed drug label sections for elotuzumab, acute kidney injury is specifically mentioned under ""Serious adverse reactions"" in the ELOQUENT-2 clinical trial section. It states that acute renal failure was reported in 2.5% of patients treated with the combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone compared to 1.9% in the control arm that received lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. This indicates that there was a small, increased incidence of acute renal failure in the treatment group that included elotuzumab.

To refute a relationship between acute kidney injury and elotuzumab exposure, one would typically search for evidence that demonstrates no significant difference in the occurrence of this adverse reaction between patients treated with elotuzumab and those not treated with the drug. However, the data provided indicates a slight increase in the incidence of acute renal failure with elotuzumab use, which does not refute the relationship. Additionally, the label does not mention studies explicitly undertaken to investigate the lack of an association between acute kidney injury and elotuzumab.

Hence, based on the available information from the drug label, there is no summarized evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to elotuzumab. The data suggests a potential association that was observed in a clinical trial setting. Therefore, the response to your request is not 'NA' given the mention of acute renal failure in the context of the treatment regimen that includes elotuzumab."
acute kidney injury,eltrombopag,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to eltrombopag (PROMACTA) is not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections. The adverse reactions and clinical trial experiences listed primarily focus on events such as hepatotoxicity, hepatic decompensation, increased risk of thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, and cataracts, among other effects like hematologic responses and liver function abnormalities.

From the provided text, thrombotic microangiopathy with acute renal failure was reported in <1% of PROMACTA-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients in clinical trials examining the treatment of adult persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This suggests that AKI has been observed, albeit infrequently, as a potential adverse reaction associated with eltrombopag treatment.

Moreover, the label mentions that thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, which can sometimes involve the kidneys, were reported in 6% of PROMACTA-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. Nevertheless, the specific incidence or direct association of eltrombopag with AKI is not detailed outside of the context of thrombotic microangiopathy.

In conclusion, while the label and provided sections do not offer detailed evidence of a direct link between eltrombopag and AKI, there is acknowledgment of rare events of thrombotic microangiopathy with acute renal failure in <1% of treated patients. For a comprehensive assessment of the risk of AKI related to eltrombopag, further investigation into post-marketing surveillance data, case studies, and additional clinical trial data not provided here would be necessary. If such evidence exists, it was not included in the provided sections of the drug label; therefore, one should consult the complete product information or scientific literature for a thorough evaluation.",NA
acute kidney injury,eltrombopag,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to eltrombopag (marketed as PROMACTA) is not explicitly listed among the common adverse reactions detailed in the drug label sections provided. The adverse reactions that are commonly reported and associated with eltrombopag include anemia, nausea, pyrexia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, cough, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and thrombotic/thromboembolic complications.

Specific to the relationship between eltrombopag and AKI, the information provided from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance does not mention AKI directly. It has been reported in clinical trials that thrombotic microangiopathy with acute renal failure occurred in less than 1% of PROMACTA-treated patients in the context of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) trials. Thrombotic microangiopathy can lead to AKI; however, this is not the same as reporting direct incidence of AKI as an adverse reaction. Moreover, no strong causal link has been established based on the information from the drug label excerpts provided.

In terms of hepatic-related adverse effects, the label does contain warnings about hepatotoxicity (e.g., hepatitis, elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia), which indicates that liver function needs to be monitored during eltrombopag therapy. Hepatotoxicity could potentially impact kidney function, as the two organs are closely interconnected; however, a direct link between eltrombopag and AKI cannot be conclusively drawn from the details provided.

In summary, based on the provided drug label sections for eltrombopag, there is no explicitly stated evidence of a relationship between eltrombopag exposure and acute kidney injury. Any potential link seems to be indirect and not commonly reported. Clinical practitioners need to be aware of the drug's safety profile and monitor patients for various adverse reactions, including but not directly limited to AKI. If more specific information or reports have emerged on the relationship between eltrombopag and AKI, they were not included in the information provided. Therefore, clinicians should remain vigilant and consult the most current literature and post-marketing surveillance data when prescribing eltrombopag.",NA
acute kidney injury,emapalumab,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is mentioned as an adverse reaction observed in patients treated with emapalumab (GAMIFANT), although it is not among the most common adverse reactions. In the clinical trial experience section (section 6.1) of the drug label, AKI is listed among additional selected adverse reactions that were reported in less than 10% of patients. This indicates that although AKI has been reported, it is neither a frequent nor a leading adverse reaction associated with emapalumab use.

Emapalumab is indicated for use in patients with primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare and life-threatening condition with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The evidence from the clinical trial reflected in the drug label (NCT01818492) indicates that serious adverse reactions occurred in more than half of the patients (53%), and AKI was reported in a smaller subset of these patients.

It's crucial to note that while AKI is reported, the incidence seems to be relatively low, and there is no indication in the label that AKI was a causally linked or consistent outcome. AKI can often arise in the context of severe underlying disease, due to infections, dehydration, or other factors, which could be coincidental rather than directly caused by the drug.

The provided drug label does not extensively detail the circumstances or the potential mechanism by which emapalumab could contribute to AKI. More information about the context (e.g., concomitant medications, severity and stage of HLH, or pre-existing kidney issues) would be necessary to better understand the relationship between emapalumab and the occurrence of AKI.

In conclusion, while acute kidney injury is listed as an adverse reaction in patients treated with emapalumab, the evidence for a direct causal relationship is not comprehensively discussed in the drug label. AKI is reported as an observed adverse event but with a relatively low incidence in the clinical trial context. Further in-depth studies or post-marketing surveillance data would be necessary to substantiate a clearer relationship between emapalumab exposure and AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,empagliflozin,,"**Evidence for Acute Kidney Injury Related to Empagliflozin (Brand Name: JARDIANCE):**

Clinical Trials Data:
According to the data from pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 1976 patients exposed to JARDIANCE (empagliflozin), acute kidney injury and impairment in renal function were mentioned as notable adverse reactions (Section 6.1). In these trials, the treatment with JARDIANCE was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (glomerular filtration rate). Notably, this effect seemed to be reversible after discontinuation of the treatment, which can suggest that acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the observed renal changes.

Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline exhibited larger mean changes in creatinine and eGFR. An explicit mention of this is in Section 6.1 (""Acute Impairment in Renal Function"") and Table 2, which show changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFR among users of JARDIANCE compared with placebo users.

Moreover, Section 5.3 (""Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function"") included in the Warnings and Precautions of the label, highlights the risk associated with JARDIANCE and advises the consideration of certain factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury. This includes patients with hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and those on concomitant medications known to affect renal function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs). It also advises monitoring renal function during therapy and considering the temporary discontinuation of JARDIANCE in settings conducive to reduced oral intake or fluid losses.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
Section 6.2 (“Postmarketing Experience”) underscores that additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JARDIANCE. While it does not provide specific figures or incidence rates for acute kidney injury, it confirms that such cases have been reported.

In Sum, evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance suggests that there is an established relationship between the use of empagliflozin and acute kidney injury. Patients treated with JARDIANCE exhibited changes in renal function, including increased serum creatinine and decreased eGFR, which are consistent with acute kidney injury. These changes were more pronounced in patients with pre-existing moderate renal impairment and the risk of this adverse reaction is highlighted in both the clinical trials experience and postmarketing surveillance reports.

**Please note that the information provided is based on available data up to the knowledge cutoff date and the current labeling of the drug as of that time. For the most recent information, always refer to the latest labeling and safety information from the drug manufacturer and relevant health authorities.**",NA
acute kidney injury,empagliflozin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to empagliflozin (marketed as JARDIANCE) is supported by evidence from post-marketing surveillance as described in the provided drug label. According to section 6.2 ""Postmarketing Experience"" of the label, AKI has been identified as an adverse reaction following the approval of JARDIANCE. This adverse event has been reported voluntarily from users outside of clinical trials, and while its exact frequency is not stated, the reports have been sufficient to link AKI causally to the drug exposure and include it in the labeling.

Furthermore, the warnings and precautions section (5.2) in the label highlight potential risks for acute transient changes in creatinine and AKI in the context of volume depletion which is a known pharmacologic effect of empagliflozin due to its osmotic diuretic action. While increased urination and volume depletion were reported in clinical trials (sections 6.1 ""Clinical Trials Experience"" and 5.2 ""Volume Depletion""), the connection to AKI appears to be more evident in the post-marketing phase.

Specifically, there have been cases of AKI requiring hospitalization and dialysis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. The patients at higher risk for such renal injury include those with preexisting renal impairment, elderly patients, or those taking loop diuretics.

It is important to note that clinical trials themselves did not provide a direct or strong association of empagliflozin with AKI; it was the post-marketing data that yielded this insight. The lack of definitive incidence rates in clinical trials may be due to the controlled nature of those studies, which often exclude patients with significant comorbidities or more severe renal impairment.

In conclusion, the evidence for a connection between empagliflozin and AKI primarily comes from real-world use after the drug was released into the market (post-marketing experience), rather than from the initial clinical trials. The mechanisms mentioned in related sections of the drug label (5.2 Volume Depletion and changes in creatinine and eGFR) support the biologically plausible pathway through which empagliflozin could lead to AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,enalapril,,"The drug label for enalapril maleate provided does not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction. However, within the clinical laboratory test findings section, it is noted that minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate alone. It is also stated that such increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery stenosis. In patients with heart failure, particularly those also receiving diuretics with or without digitalis, increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine were observed in approximately 11 percent of patients, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril maleate or diuretic therapy. These increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine are indicative of a decline in kidney function, which may reflect AKI.

Moreover, the label explains that these increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients, suggesting that the drug can negatively affect kidney function in a small percentage of users, potentially leading to acute kidney injury.

While the drug label does not specify AKI as an adverse reaction, the documented changes in kidney function parameters (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine) imply that enalapril maleate has the potential to cause kidney injury in certain patients, particularly in the presence of risk factors such as concomitant diuretic use or pre-existing renal artery stenosis.

To further assess the relationship between enalapril and AKI, a comprehensive search of the medical literature and reviews of case studies and post-marketing surveillance data would be necessary. If further data from these sources were available, they would provide a more complete understanding of the incidence and causality of AKI related to enalapril use. Nonetheless, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is at least some evidence to suggest a relationship between enalapril exposure and potential adverse effects on kidney function.","NA

The evidence provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections of enalapril maleate's drug label does not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and enalapril exposure. In fact, under ""Clinical Laboratory Test Findings,"" it explicitly mentions that minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine—markers often associated with renal function—were observed in about 0.2 percent of hypertensive patients treated with enalapril. The document also states that in patients with heart failure receiving diuretics, increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine were observed in about 11 percent of patients, and these increases were sometimes severe enough to warrant discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients.

Given that changes in these laboratory values may indicate renal impairment, the evidence does not refute—but rather supports—the possibility of acute kidney injury as an adverse effect of enalapril, particularly in specific patient populations or under certain clinical conditions.

Please note that in clinical practice, enalapril's effect on renal function would be nuanced, and the drug is indeed used carefully in patients with certain types of renal impairment due to its ability to decrease intraglomerular pressure, but with the risk of acute kidney injury if renal perfusion is compromised."
acute kidney injury,enalaprilat,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for enalaprilat, acute kidney injury does not appear as a directly listed adverse reaction. However, the label does mention ""renal failure"" and ""renal dysfunction"" under the ""Urogenital"" category as potential adverse events, which can include acute kidney injury as a more severe manifestation.

Clinical trials mentioned in the label do not explicitly state acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction but do note minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in approximately 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril alone. These increases are indicators of kidney dysfunction and are reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. They are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in those with renal artery stenosis.

No specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data are provided in the drug label sections that were shared. Nevertheless, any reported cases of renal dysfunction could imply instances of acute kidney injury, given that they fall within the spectrum of renal adverse effects.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not explicitly stated as an adverse reaction in the provided drug label sections for enalaprilat, evidence suggests an association with renal dysfunction and minor increases in renal biomarkers in a small proportion of patients exposed to enalapril, the prodrug of enalaprilat. If there are case studies or post-marketing reports that specifically mention acute kidney injury as an adverse event related to enalaprilat, these were not included in the sections provided. Therefore, it would be advisable to consult the full drug label, additional clinical data, or a healthcare professional for a comprehensive understanding of all associated adverse reactions.",NA
acute kidney injury,enasidenib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for enasidenib (IDHIFA), the evidence related to acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction can be summarized as follows:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: In clinical trials involving 214 patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) treated with enasidenib, differentiation syndrome was reported in 14% of patients. Among the symptoms of differentiation syndrome observed were acute renal failure and renal impairment, which may indicate instances of AKI. Additionally, the drug label notes that renal dysfunction was part of the multi-organ dysfunction observed in the context of differentiation syndrome. This suggests that AKI can indeed be an adverse reaction when undergoing treatment with enasidenib, in the setting of differentiation syndrome.

2. **Differentiation Syndrome**: Differentiation syndrome is described as a potentially fatal condition that could emerge as early as 1 day and up to 5 months after starting enasidenib. Among the various manifestations of differentiation syndrome, renal impairment was noted in 70% of affected individuals. This further supports the link between enasidenib and potential AKI as a part of this syndrome.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: There is no specified documentation in the provided sections of the post-marketing surveillance data regarding AKI directly.

In the context of the provided drug label sections, there is evidence that supports AKI as a potential adverse reaction to enasidenib due to its association with differentiation syndrome and the incidence of renal failure or impairment as a part of the syndrome’s symptomatology. However, AKI is not listed as an isolated common adverse reaction (≥20%), and specific rates of AKI as a discrete adverse event separate from differentiation syndrome are not detailed.

Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of differentiation syndrome, including renal impairment, when treating patients with enasidenib and manage suspected cases with appropriate interventions such as corticosteroid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring.

It is essential to consider that actual rates of AKI and its explicit relationship to enasidenib might be further detailed in the full clinical study reports or post-marketing surveillance data that is not provided here. For a thorough assessment, a review of the most recent scientific literature, clinical study data, and post-marketing reports would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,encorafenib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction and exposure to encorafenib (BRAFTOVI) is derived from clinical trial data.

According to the information provided from the PHAROS trial, acute kidney injury was one of the adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions in 5% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib for BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This suggests a relationship between encorafenib exposure and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in this patient population.

Additionally, increased creatinine levels, which may indicate impaired kidney function or injury, were reported as a laboratory abnormality in the COLUMBUS trial in 9% of patients (3.3% with Grades 3 and 4 severity) receiving encorafenib in combination with binimetinib for BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This data further denotes a potential link between the drug and renal adverse effects.

However, the incidence of acute kidney injury and related clinical details, such as the onset time, resolution, management required, or any underlying conditions that might predispose to such an injury, are not provided in depth in the material available.

Furthermore, there are no specific warnings, precautions, or box warnings on the encorafenib (BRAFTOVI) label that address acute kidney injury directly, suggesting that while it is a known adverse reaction, it may not be among the most common or severe.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials, specifically the PHAROS trial, indicates that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction associated with encorafenib when used in combination with binimetinib in the treatment of BRAf V600E mutation-positive advanced cancers, including metastatic NSCLC. Laboratory abnormalities observed in the COLUMBUS trial align with these findings and suggest potential renal impairment. Clinical vigilance for renal function is advised for patients under treatment with encorafenib, although the risk appears to be a less prominent concern compared to other adverse reactions outlined in the drug’s label.",NA
acute kidney injury,enfortumab,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and enfortumab vedotin (PADCEV) exposure comes from various clinical trials as detailed in the provided drug label sections for adverse reactions and warnings:

1. Clinical Trials: AKI was documented as a serious adverse reaction in different clinical trials involving enfortumab vedotin:
   - EV-302 Trial: 5% of patients receiving enfortumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab experienced AKI.
   - EV-103 Trial: 7% of patients experienced AKI with the same combination therapy.
   - EV-301 Trial: 7% of patients treated with enfortumab vedotin as a single agent had AKI.
   These incidences indicate that AKI is a recognized adverse event associated with the use of enfortumab vedotin.

2. Fatalities: Fatal adverse reactions related to AKI were also reported in patients treated with PADCEV. While the exact number is not provided, any occurrence of a fatality due to AKI indicates a severe risk that is acknowledged in clinical experience with the drug.

3. Dose Adjustments: The occurrence of AKI led to treatment interruption, dose adjustment, or discontinuation in some patients, reaffirming its significance as an adverse reaction to PADCEV.

4. Post-Marketing Experience: While specific post-marketing surveillance data regarding AKI is not provided in the sections cited, the presence of AKI as a serious adverse reaction in clinical trial data means that a relationship is established even without post-marketing data.

In summary, the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to enfortumab vedotin is supported by data from clinical trials where a notable percentage of patients experienced AKI. This adverse reaction has been serious enough to warrant dose modification or treatment discontinuation in some cases and has been associated with fatalities, highlighting its clinical importance. It is also listed explicitly in the labeled warnings, which healthcare providers use to monitor and manage patient health during treatment with PADCEV.",NA
acute kidney injury,enfuvirtide,,"Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence listed in the drug label that directly associates enfuvirtide with acute kidney injury as a common adverse effect. The clinical trials and postmarketing experience sections of the enfuvirtide label do not mention acute kidney injury as a frequent adverse reaction. However, under the ""Less Common Events"" section of the label, there is mention of renal and urinary disorders in subjects treated with FUZEON (the brand name for enfuvirtide), including glomerulonephritis, tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, and renal failure (including fatal cases). It is important to note that this list specifies that a causal relationship to FUZEON has not been established for these reported events.

To provide a clear summary based on the label information:

1. The relationship between enfuvirtide and acute kidney injury is not highlighted in the sections for common adverse reactions or boxed warnings.

2. Under the less common adverse events section, renal disorders including renal failure have been reported, but a causal link to enfuvirtide has not been definitively established.

3. No incidence rates or evidence from clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance specifically addressing acute kidney injury in relation to enfuvirtide use are provided.

In conclusion, there is mention of serious renal adverse events in enfuvirtide-treated subjects, but there is *no established evidence* in the provided drug label that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction attributable to enfuvirtide use. Additional pharmacovigilance data, case reports, or research studies would be needed to establish a causal relationship. If such evidence is sought, a thorough review of scientific literature, clinical trial data, and post-marketing surveillance reports beyond the drug label would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,entecavir,0.0,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for entecavir, there is no explicit evidence listed that directly associates entecavir with acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. Clinical trials detailed in the label (studies AI463014, AI463022, AI463026, and AI463027) that compare entecavir with lamivudine in subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease do not indicate acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions for entecavir-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Additionally, laboratory abnormalities presented in the clinical trials did not include a notable frequency of renal function deterioration that would be indicative of acute kidney injury; specifically, the table detailing selected laboratory abnormalities did not show a high incidence of creatinine increases (a marker of kidney function) that would signal acute kidney injury.

Furthermore, in the labeling for entecavir, postmarketing experience mentions various adverse reactions reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, with no possibility to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to entecavir exposure. However, within this section, there is no mention of acute kidney injury being reported.

In the context of decompensated liver disease (study AI463048), while there was mention of renal failure in less than 1% of subjects, this cannot be clearly attributed to acute kidney injury without additional context regarding the nature of the renal failure.

To conclusively determine the risk of acute kidney injury associated with entecavir, further investigation is warranted. If specific case studies or more extensive postmarketing data that includes cases of acute kidney injury associated with entecavir are available, they were not included in the label and would need to be reviewed for additional evidence. Thus, based on the available information in the sections provided from the entecavir drug labeling, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between entecavir exposure and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,epinephrine,,"After reviewing the provided sections of the drug label for epinephrine, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in sections 6 (Adverse Reactions), 5 (Warnings and Precautions), or the box warnings. Epinephrine is known to cause a variety of cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and other systemic effects. Specifically, cardiovascular reactions can include angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, palpitations, tachycardia, and vasoconstriction, amongst others.

AKI is not listed as a known adverse reaction to systemically administered epinephrine in these sections of the drug label. It should be noted, however, that while the drug label is a crucial source of information about the known adverse reactions of a medication, it may not encompass all possible side effects, especially extremely rare or only recently discovered ones. Additionally, epinephrine can cause rapid rises in blood pressure, and in certain cases, uncontrolled hypertension could theoretically contribute to renal injury.

To provide a more comprehensive picture, a thorough literature review would be necessary. This would include searching for case reports, clinical trial data, or observational studies that might not be referenced in the drug label but could potentially report acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. If such data were available, it would be crucial to evaluate the strength of the evidence, considering factors like temporal association, dose-response relationship, and assessment for alternative explanations.

At this time, based solely on the drug label information provided, there is no known evidence directly linking epinephrine use with acute kidney injury. For updated information or more specific inquiries about this potential adverse reaction, a literature search and consultation with medical databases or a healthcare professional would be recommended.",NA
acute kidney injury,eravacycline,,"After reviewing the provided sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) of the drug label for eravacycline (XERAVA), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance. The most common adverse reactions mentioned are infusion site reactions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension, among others.

Regarding kidney-related adverse reactions, the label mentions ""decreased renal clearance of creatinine"" in less than 1% of patients in the Phase 3 trials, which implies a potential for renal impairment, but it does not directly confirm AKI. Additionally, the label warns of potential anti-anabolic actions associated with tetracycline-class drugs, which include increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and azotemia, often linked to kidney dysfunction, but it does not specifically cite AKI.

While AKI is not listed as a direct adverse reaction to eravacycline, the presence of decreased renal clearance of creatinine could be suggestive of a renal effect. However, this does not constitute clear evidence of AKI, and no specific incidences of AKI related to eravacycline use are provided in the drug label portions provided.

Therefore, based on the information given, there is no concrete evidence supporting a direct relationship between eravacycline exposure and the development of acute kidney injury. This conclusion is limited to the content of the label sections provided and does not include a review of other possible medical literature or reports outside the scope of the labeling information. To determine a definitive link, further investigation through extended clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing reports would be needed.",NA
acute kidney injury,ergocalciferol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ergocalcerol, there is an indication that adverse reactions related to renal function can occur as a result of hypervitaminosis D. Specifically, the label mentions renal impairment with symptoms such as polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, and hypercalciuria which could potentially lead to reversible azotemia or more serious outcomes such as irreversible renal insufficiency or death. Nephrocalcinosis and generalized vascular calcification have also been noted, which can contribute to kidney damage.

While the term ""acute kidney injury"" (AKI) is not directly used in this labeling, the described symptoms like reversible azotemia and irreversible renal insufficiency can be understood as a spectrum of renal dysfunction that may include AKI. Acute kidney injury is often characterized by a sudden reduction in kidney function, which can be evidenced by azotemia, a condition where nitrogen-containing compounds build up in the blood due to impaired renal filtration.

The label does not provide detailed evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specific to AKI as a direct adverse reaction to ergocalciferol. However, the label does present a relationship between high doses of ergocalciferol leading to hypervitaminosis D and subsequent renal-related adverse effects including potential renal insufficiency.

For a precise, evidence-based assessment of the causal relationship between ergocalciferol and acute kidney injury, it would be necessary to consult specific clinical case reports, clinical trial data, and analyses of post-marketing surveillance that document instances of AKI in patients administered ergocalciferol. Unfortunately, these specific details are not provided in the excerpt of the drug label presented, and thus, one must assume that the label's general warnings about renal impairment are the main source suggesting a possible link to AKI.

In summary, according to the drug label provided, there is evidence that excessive intake of ergocalciferol can result in renal impairment, and while acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned, the described conditions could encompass AKI. More detailed evidence from clinical studies or case reports would be needed to confidently assess the specific frequency and causality of AKI as a reaction to ergocalciferol.",NA
acute kidney injury,erlotinib,,"There is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) being an adverse reaction to erlotinib in the provided drug label sections. However, kidney-related adverse reactions such as ""Renal Failure"" and renal impairment have been noted:

1. Clinical Trials:
   - Renal Failure is referenced in the Warnings and Precautions (5.2) section, indicating the necessity to monitor renal function and electrolytes, particularly in patients at risk of dehydration.
   - Hepatorenal syndrome and severe acute renal failure, including fatal cases, are also mentioned. The pooled incidence of severe renal impairment in three lung cancer studies was 0.5% in erlotinib arms and 0.8% in the control arms. Meanwhile, in the pancreatic cancer study, the incidence of renal impairment was 1.4% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm (5.2 Renal Failure).

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   - There is no specific mention of AKI. However, generalized renal failure is listed as a concern in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2), which could imply AKI as a potential outcome.

3. Case Studies:
   - The drug label does not provide information from case studies regarding AKI.

Since the label advises withholding erlotinib for severe renal toxicity, this suggests that renal adverse effects, potentially including AKI, have been observed. However, specific evidence linking erlotinib exposure to AKI in terms of published case studies or direct clinical trial evidence is not provided in the drug label information presented here.

In conclusion, while the provided drug label sections do not explicitly state AKI as a reported adverse reaction to erlotinib, renal failure and renal impairment are acknowledged issues. For a definitive assessment of the relationship between erlotinib and AKI, further investigation would be needed including a review of peer-reviewed literature, additional clinical trial data, or more detailed analyses from post-marketing surveillance data.",NA
acute kidney injury,ertapenem,,"The provided sections of the drug label for ertapenem (INVANZ) do not explicitly mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an identified adverse reaction from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. However, mention of ""renal impairment"" is made within the Urogenital System subsection under ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience.""

To evaluate the evidence supporting AKI as an adverse reaction to ertapenem, we can consider the following details extracted from the label:

1. Clinical Trials:
   - Under ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience,"" the drug label specifies the most common adverse reactions, but AKI is not listed among them. However, it does include ""renal impairment"" under additional adverse experiences with an incidence >0.1%.
   - For prophylaxis of surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery, the incidence of adverse events and relevant adverse laboratory changes were generally comparable to those observed in previous clinical trials, with no explicit mention of AKI.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - Under ""6.2 Post-Marketing Experience,"" various adverse reactions have been recorded, yet it does not specifically cite AKI. Post-marketing experiences are reported voluntarily and establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is more complex.
   - The section ""Urogenital System"" lists ""renal impairment,"" which might include AKI but does not specify the severity or exact nature of the renal issues reported.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   - Sections ""5.1"" through ""5.7"" emphasize other risks and special considerations when using ertapenem, such as hypersensitivity reactions, seizure potential, and Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD). There's no specific warning pertaining to AKI.

Based on the information given in the drug label provided, there is an indication that ""renal impairment"" has been reported both in clinical trials and post-marketing experiences, and this could potentially encompass acute kidney injury. However, there is no concrete evidence or specific mention of acute kidney injury being directly attributed to ertapenem exposure from the sections provided.

In conclusion, while there is no definitive evidence in the sections shared from the drug label that directly links ertapenem to acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction, ""renal impairment"" has been observed. Further investigation into the full scientific literature, including clinical trials, case studies, and more detailed post-marketing data, would be needed to fully assess the relationship between ertapenem and acute kidney injury.","Based on the provided drug label information, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction to ertapenem (INVANZ). The label describes various adverse reactions and laboratory changes that occurred in clinical trial subjects and post-marketing experiences, but AKI is not specified among them. 

In the sections detailing adverse reactions and laboratory changes, renal impairment is mentioned under the broad category of ""Urogenital System"" adverse experiences within the clinical trials sub-section (6.1), and increased serum creatinine is noted within the ""Additional laboratory adverse experiences"" section as an incidence greater than 0.1% in adult patients. However, these do not specify acute kidney injury, and no incidence rate or detailed analysis of AKI as a direct consequence of ertapenem use is provided.

The absence of explicit mention of AKI means that either there was no significant evidence of AKI as a direct adverse reaction during the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance or that it was not considered a common or notable reaction to include. However, it is important to consider that drug-induced renal impairment can take many forms, and AKI could potentially manifest in individual cases or under certain conditions.

As a language model, I don't have the ability to access or search databases for additional or updated information beyond the provided drug label data. If AKI as an adverse reaction to ertapenem has been documented or refuted in new studies or case reports after the knowledge cutoff, such evidence is not within the scope provided. Clinicians should consult the most current medical literature and drug databases for updated information and reports related to this potential adverse reaction. Additionally, reporting to pharmacovigilance systems can provide crucial information on rare or previously unidentified adverse reactions."
acute kidney injury,ertugliflozin,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance presented in the drug label sections for ertugliflozin, there is indirect evidence that suggests acute kidney injury (AKI) could be a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of this medication, although AKI is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction under section 6.1 of the label.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:

- Volume Depletion: Section 6.1 of the drug label indicates that ertugliflozin can cause osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion, such as dehydration and hypotension, are mentioned to occur more frequently in patients with moderate renal impairment treated with ertugliflozin compared to placebo. This intravascular volume contraction could lead to AKI, especially in susceptible populations. 

- Laboratory Tests (Changes in Serum Creatinine and eGFR): Section 6.1 also reports that initiation of ertugliflozin may result in an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which, after initial changes, tend to stabilize. While these changes are reversible after discontinuation of the drug, they indicate that ertugliflozin has an impact on renal function, which could manifest clinically as AKI in certain circumstances.

Postmarketing Experience:

- Section 6.2 details postmarketing experiences and reports that there have been instances of acute kidney injury in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including ertugliflozin. These cases sometimes required hospitalization and dialysis. While postmarketing reports do not establish a causal relationship due to the voluntary nature of reporting and unknown population size, they provide real-world signals that AKI can occur with ertugliflozin use. 

Warnings and Precautions:

- Section 5.3 explicitly warns about the risk of volume depletion leading to AKI. It advises healthcare professionals to assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment or low systolic blood pressure, among others, before initiating ertugliflozin. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of volume depletion and renal function is recommended after initiating therapy.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not listed among the most common adverse reactions of ertugliflozin, evidence from clinical trials suggests that ertugliflozin can cause changes in renal function including volume depletion, which in turn could potentially lead to acute kidney injury, especially in at-risk patient populations. Additionally, cases observed in the postmarketing experience further support a potential relationship between ertugliflozin use and acute kidney injury. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor patients closely for signs of AKI when prescribing ertugliflozin.",NA
acute kidney injury,erythromycin,,"As of my last knowledge update in March 2023, the provided sections of the drug label for erythromycin do not include acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reported adverse reaction. The mentioned adverse reactions consist mainly of minor ocular irritations, redness, and hypersensitivity reactions.

Acute kidney injury is a serious condition characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function. The information you provided does not point to any direct evidence linking erythropymin eye preparations with AKI. While erythromycin is known for other side effects, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances due to its effect on motilin receptors, AKI is not commonly associated with erythromycin administered in ophthalmic form.

Evidence that supports a relationship between drug exposure and adverse reactions typically comes from clinical trials, observational studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data. In the case of erythromycin:

1. Clinical Trials: The standard procedure for assessing drug safety includes monitoring for adverse reactions during clinical trials. These trials have phases that specifically focus on safety and tolerability, but the information you provided does not mention AKI as a result of these trials.

2. Case Studies: Isolated reports of erythromycin associated adverse reactions can emerge from case studies where individuals have experienced AKI following drug administration. However, without specific case studies or published reports, we cannot substantiate erythromycin-induced AKI as a known adverse reaction.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: Once a drug is marketed, post-marketing surveillance (PMS) can detect rare adverse reactions that may not have been identified during clinical trials due to the larger and more diverse population exposed to the drug. Adverse reactions that emerge through PMS are reported to drug regulatory authorities such as the FDA. The section from the label you provided suggests reporting suspected adverse reactions to FDA but does not directly mention AKI as an observed post-market adverse event for erythromycin.

Given the information at hand, there is no directly stated evidence in the provided drug label sections linking erythromycin use with acute kidney injury. Should such an association exist, it would likely be documented outside of the provided sections in dedicated nephrology-specific literature or in databases that collect adverse drug reactions. If concerns exist regarding a potential but undocumented adverse reaction such as AKDFollowing erythromycin exposure, healthcare providers typically report these incidents to surveillance systems like the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) for further investigation.",NA
acute kidney injury,escitalopram,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for escitalopram, there is no explicit evidence or mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction directly related to the use of escitalopram. The sections detail various adverse reactions observed with the use of escitalopram, both in adults and pediatric patients, but do not include acute kidney injury.

Available evidence comes from clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and pharmacovigilance databases. The adverse reactions observed in clinical trials detailed in the label include common ones such as insomnia, ejaculation disorder, increased sweating, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, decreased libido, and anorgasmia. Other adverse reactions discussed in other sections of the labeling include suicidal thoughts and behaviors, serotonin syndrome, discontinuation syndrome, seizures, mania or hypomania, hyponatremia, bleeding, angle-closure glaucoma, and cognitive and motor impairment.

The post-marketing experience section reports adverse reactions identified after drug approval. These include various system-specific disorders such as those affecting blood, cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and other body systems. Acute renal failure is listed among renal and urinary disorders within the post-marketing experience; however, it does not specifically mention acute kidney injury and does not provide frequency or establish a causal relationship with escitalopram use.

In clinical practice, when assessing the potential risks associated with a medication, it is also necessary to consider pharmacovigilance reports, individual case safety reports, and the wider medical literature for any evidence of rare or previously unidentified adverse reactions. However, the provided information does not include such data sources or analysis.

Therefore, based on the available labeling information provided, there is no known evidence directly associating acute kidney injury with the use of escitalopram. Healthcare practitioners should refer to the latest clinical guidelines, pharmacovigilance data, and published literature for any emerging evidence on this topic and report any suspected adverse reactions according to local regulations and protocols.",NA
acute kidney injury,etodolac,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for etodolac, evidence supports the relationship between etodolac exposure and the occurrence of abnormal renal function as an adverse reaction. This evidence comes from both clinical trials and worldwide post-marketing surveillance studies. Specifically, under the ""Incidence Greater Than Or Equal To 1% - Probably Causally Related"" section, ""abnormal renal function"" is listed, suggesting that during clinical trials this adverse reaction was observed in more than 1% of the patients. Furthermore, under the ""Metabolic and nutritional"" heading within the ""Incidence Less Than 1% - Probably Causally Related"" section, ""serum creatinine increase"" is reported, which may indicate acute kidney injury.

Additionally, the ""Urogenital system"" list under the ""Incidence Less Than 1% - Probably Causally Related"" category includes ""renal failure"" and ""renal insufficiency."" Although these terms do not explicitly mention acute kidney injury, both can be outcomes of severe acute kidney injury. Moreover, ""renal papillary necrosis"" is included, which is a specific pathological condition that can result from analgesic abuse and could indicate a potential for kidney injury with etodolac use.

The section ""Incidence Less Than 1% - Causal Relationship Unknown"" indicates ""renal impairment"" under the ""Urogenital system,"" which does not establish a direct causative relationship due to uncertainty, but it does raise a concern for renal-related adverse effects.

Overall, while the term ""acute kidney injury"" is not directly used in the labeled adverse reactions, the evidence of renal-related adversities, such as abnormal renal function, serum creatinine increase, renal failure, renal insufficiency, and renal papillary necrosis, implies that there is a documented risk of kidney injury associated with etodolac. This information is derived from an aggregation of data from clinical trials involving arthritic patients and the post-marketing surveillance of the drug.

It is important for healthcare providers to consider these adverse effects when prescribing etodolac and to monitor renal function in patients receiving the drug, especially those with existing renal conditions or other risk factors for renal dysfunction.",NA
acute kidney injury,etoposide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction and etoposide (ETOPOPHOS) comes primarily from post-marketing experience. According to the drug label provided, reversible cases of acute renal failure have been reported specifically in the context of administering high doses of ETOPOPHOS (2220 mg/m^2) alongside total body irradiation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The causal factor is suggested to be the dextran 40 contained in the formulation, which has been associated with acute renal failure when administered in high doses.

There is no specific mention of acute kidney injury under the adverse reactions or warnings section from clinical trials data for standard doses of etoposide, which suggests that the concern for renal toxicity is particularly associated with the high-dose context described above. The most common toxicities reported in clinical trials with etoposide involve hematologic (e.g., myelosuppression leading to neutropenia) and gastrointestinal adverse reactions, with nephrotoxicity not being prominently featured among common treatment-related side effects.

It's worth noting that in post-marketing surveillance, the frequency of adverse reactions is not always well-established due to voluntary reporting and unknown population size, making it harder to obtain precise incidence rates. To better understand the nature of this relationship, clinical data specific to renal outcomes with etoposide use, especially in standard oncological settings outside of the high-dose context, would be necessary. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the risk of acute kidney injury is recognized but likely rare and related to unusually high doses combined with other treatment factors, such as total body irradiation.

The source of this information is the drug label sections provided, which include adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings related to ETOPOPHOS (etoposide phosphate).",NA
acute kidney injury,etravirine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between etravirine and acute kidney injury (AKI) is limited. Based on the sections provided from the drug label, AKI is listed as an adverse drug reaction (ADR), specifically under the category of ""Renal and Urinary Disorders,"" with reported instances of acute renal failure. This association has been observed from the clinical trial data along with post-marketing surveillance.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- In clinical trials TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216 involving treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult subjects, renal and urinary disorders such as acute renal failure have been mentioned as treatment-emergent ADRs, though they occurred in less than 2% of subjects receiving etravirine (599 subjects) [Section 6.1, Clinical Trials Experience in Adults].
- Grade 3 (creatinine levels > 1.9–3.4 × Upper Limit of Normal) occurred in 2% and Grade 4 (> 3.4 × ULN) in less than 1% of subjects treated with etravirine (599 subjects) [Section 6.1, Table 3: Laboratory Abnormalities Observed in Treatment-Experienced Subjects].
- In pediatric trials, the adverse reactions were largely similar to those seen in adults, with no specific mention of AKI; rash and diarrhea were the most common adverse drug reactions reported [Section 6.1, Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects].

Postmarketing Experience:
- Acute renal failure is listed again under postmarketing experiences indicating that there have been reports of this condition occurring in patients taking etravirine [Section 6.2].
- However, given that these are voluntarily reported from an unknown size population, the exact frequency is difficult to estimate, and establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is challenging.

No evidence from case studies specific to AKI associated with etravirine has been provided in the sections of the drug label.

In summary, while there is mention of acute renal failure as an adverse reaction to etravirine in both adults and postmarketing surveillance data, the information does not provide a detailed incidence rate or establish a solid causal relationship. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of AKI in the boxed warnings or specific warnings and precautions sections, suggesting that while renal issues have been observed, they might not be among the most common or most severe reactions. Clinicians should continue to monitor renal function in patients taking etravirine, especially those with pre-existing renal conditions or concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for etravirine (Intelence), acute kidney injury is not listed as an identified adverse reaction or warning associated with the use of etravirine in either adult or pediatric patients. The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities mentioned focus primarily on severe skin reactions, peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal issues, hematologic disorders, metabolic disturbances, and hepatic parameters, but do not include acute kidney injury.

The section on renal and urinary disorders references ""acute renal failure"" as an adverse drug reaction observed in less than 2% of subjects in clinical trials, but it does not elaborate on a causal relationship with the drug, nor does it refute it. However, the lack of mention in the main warnings or precautions suggests that acute kidney injury is not a characteristic adverse effect directly attributed to etravirine based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experience.

Nevertheless, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The lack of documentation in the sections provided does not definitively prove that etravirine cannot cause acute kidney injury, but it does indicate that there is no significant observed association in the clinical trial data or identified in postmarketing surveillance as of the knowledge cutoff. Further investigation into the full scientific literature and the most recent data on postmarketing surveillance would be required to fully refute the relationship or confirm the safety of etravirine in relation to renal function."
acute kidney injury,etravirine,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for etravirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, there is mention of renal and urinary disorders that include acute renal failure as a treatment-emergent adverse drug reaction (ADR). However, specific details about the evidence that supports the relationship between etravirine and acute kidney injury (AKI) are not explicitly detailed in the provided sections.

Under the section ""Less Common Adverse Reactions,"" it is mentioned that acute renal failure was observed in subjects treated with etravirine, but the incidence is stated to be less than 2% in the Phase 3 clinical trial participants (599 subjects). This implies that acute kidney injury was a reported ADR in the trials, though at a lower rate. No specific incidence rate or contextual details about these observations, such as baseline kidney function or confounding factors, are provided in the excerpt.

Regarding laboratory abnormalities, there is one mention of Grade 2 to 4 increases in creatinine levels—indicative of impaired kidney function—among subjects. Grade 2 creatinine elevation was observed in 6% of etravirine-treated subjects compared to 5% in the placebo group, and Grade 3 in 2% of etravirine subjects versus 1% of placebo subjects, with no Grade 4 observations in the former group. This suggests a slightly higher occurrence of renal functional impairment associated with etravirine but does not constitute a direct connection to acute kidney injury.

In summary, the indirect evidence from clinical trials referenced in the etravirine drug label suggests that there have been infrequent reports of acute kidney injury associated with its use. However, the data in the provided sections lack comprehensive information, and without access to more detailed clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance reports specifically investigating the relationship between etravirine and AKI, a conclusive assessment of causality cannot be made solely based on the drug label excerpts presented. Therefore, clinicians should monitor kidney function in patients being treated with etravirine and consider all potential risks and benefits, especially in patients with pre-existing renal conditions or those taking concomitant medications with known renal toxicity.",NA
acute kidney injury,everolimus,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and everolimus exposure can be gleaned from the provided drug label sections. Specifically, the ""Renal Failure"" section (5.6) within ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" indicates that cases of renal failure, which include acute renal failure, have occurred in patients taking everolimus. While the incidence rates and severity of AKI in clinical trials are not explicitly described in the provided sections, the label clearly lists AKI as an adverse reaction and advises monitoring renal function prior to and during treatment with everolimus.

In the ""Adverse Reactions"" section (6.1), the reported rates of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from several clinical trials are detailed, without mentioning AKI or ""acute renal failure"" as a common adverse reaction or laboratory abnormality. However, Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus arm as mentioned in the Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET) section. Additionally, deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse reaction was the primary cause included one case of acute renal failure on the everolimus arm.

In the context of postmarketing experience (section 6.2), acute pancreatitis is listed, which can be associated with kidney injury, but acute kidney injury itself is not specifically mentioned.

The association between everolimus and AKI is based on observed cases and clinical advice for monitoring, implying a recognized risk, although the label does not provide detailed incidence rates from clinical trials. Kidney function monitoring recommendations indicate that healthcare professionals should be aware of and manage the risk of renal impairment during everolimus therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,everolimus,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and everolimus exposure is suggested in several sections of the drug label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Kidney Transplantation: Under section 6.2, the clinical trials experience describes that during the study of everolimus in de novo kidney transplant patients, the overall incidence of serious adverse reactions was 57% in the everolimus group, with renal and urinary disorders reported in 10% of the patients. This data reflects that renal-related adverse effects were observed during the trials.
   - Liver Transplantation: Although not directly about kidney transplantation, in liver transplant patients, an important point to consider is nephrotoxicity (section 5.6), where reduced doses of tacrolimus were required in combination with everolimus to minimize the risk of renal dysfunction.

2. Warnings and Precautions:
   - Section 5.6 of the label warns about everolimus and calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity, highlighting that everolimus increases the risk of renal dysfunction, especially when used with standard doses of cyclosporine.

3. Post Marketing Experience:
   - While not explicitly mentioning AKI, the post-marketing surveillance under section 6.3 lists several renal-related issues, such as proteinuria and increased blood creatinine levels. This suggests that renal adverse effects have been observed following the product reaching the market.

In conclusion, while the term ""acute kidney injury"" is not directly used in the sections provided, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that suggests everolimus is associated with adverse reactions that can impact kidney function, such as nephrotoxicity, renal and urinary disorders, and increased serum creatinine. It is important to monitor renal function closely during the administration of everolimus.

Additionally, everolimus label explicitly warns about the increased risk of nephrotoxicity particularly when used in combination with standard doses of cyclosporine, which supports the relationship between everolimus and potential adverse renal effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,exenatide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the use of exenatide (BYDUREON BCISE) comes from post-marketing surveillance data, as stated in the prescribing information under Section 5.4 (Warnings and Precautions: Acute Kidney Injury) and Section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience). According to the label:

1. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2): There have been reports of altered renal function in patients using exenatide, which included increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure, and acute renal failure. Some cases required hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. These adverse events occurred in some patients who experienced nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, potentially leading to dehydration.

2. Warnings and Precautions: Acute Kidney Injury (Section 5.4): The prescribing information advises that exenatide may induce nausea and vomiting with transient hypovolemia (fluid loss), which can subsequently lead to renal function worsening. The label also notes reports of acute renal failure post-marketing, with some requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may be at increased risk, particularly if they are using other medications known to affect renal function or their hydration status.

3. Clinical Trials (Section 6.1): The clinical trials section does not directly link exenatide to AKI but mentions commonly associated gastrointestinal adverse reactions like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can lead to hypovolemia and potentially renal impairment. No specific incidence rate of AKI is noted in this section.

It is important to note that while postmarketing reports can signal a potential adverse reaction like AKI, they do not establish a causal relationship due to limitations such as voluntary reporting, underreporting, and the absence of a control group. Nonetheless, the inclusion of AKI in the Warnings and Precautions section indicates that there is a recognized potential risk of acute kidney injury associated with exenatide use based on the evidence from post-marketing data and the known mechanism of action that could lead to dehydration and renal stress. Clinicians are advised to monitor renal function in patients on exenatide and manage nausea, vomiting, and dehydration proactively.

For patients with a baseline eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, the use of exenatide is not recommended.

In summary, the evidence for the relationship between acute kidney injury and exenatide use is derived from post-marketing surveillance data suggesting an association but lacking the robustness of clinical trials to establish causality. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing exenatide to patients with potential risk factors for renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,famciclovir,,"Evidence of the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and famciclovir exposure emerges from various sources, including clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings in the drug labeling. The evidence is summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
Clinical trials conducted with famciclovir have provided safety evaluations among different patient populations treated for herpes zoster, recurrent genital herpes, herpes labialis, and suppressive therapy for genital herpes. The drug label's Table 3, derived from genital herpes suppression trials, indicates selected laboratory abnormalities, including serum creatinine elevations (0.2% for famciclovir versus 0.3% for placebo). This parameter serves to monitor kidney function, with increased serum creatinine levels potentially hinting at AKI. However, the data suggest that famciclovir has a minimal impact on kidney function in the large cohort of patients within controlled settings, considering the marginally higher incidence relative to placebo.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
During post-marketing experience, cases of AKI have been reported voluntarily and sporadically, with uncertainty around the frequency of these events due to the nature of voluntary reporting systems. This makes it difficult to establish a strong and quantifiable causal relationship between AKI and famciclovir.

Warnings and Precautions on Drug Label:
The drug label explicitly mentions the risk of AKI as associated with famciclovir exposure in section 5 (WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS). It alerts healthcare providers to the potential occurrence of AKI in patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher than recommended doses of famciclovir for their level of renal function. Hence, the drug label advises healthcare providers to adjust the dosage in patients with renal impairment.

In summary, while clinical trials show a minimal difference in serum creatinine levels between famciclovir and placebo groups, post-marketing reports and explicit warnings in the drug labeling indicate that there may be a risk of AKI associated with famciclovir, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those receiving higher doses than recommended for their level of renal function. Clinicians should monitor renal function in patients taking famciclovir and adjust dosage as necessary considering individual renal function status.",NA
acute kidney injury,febuxostat,,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction of Febuxostat:

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The provided sections of the drug label for febuxostat do not specifically list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that involved a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout treated with febuxostat. In the CARES study, which included a total of 3098 patients, AKI is also not listed as a common adverse reaction. Instead, the trials reported liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash as the most common adverse reactions. Additionally, less than 1% of patients experienced renal-related adverse reactions such as hematuria, proteinuria, renal failure, renal insufficiency, and nephrolithiasis, but these do not explicitly equate to AKI.

Evidence from Post-Marketing Surveillance:
In the postmarketing experience section, which includes adverse reactions identified after approval of febuxostat based on voluntary reports, tubulointerstitial nephritis is mentioned as a renal and urinary disorder. Tubulointerstitial nephritis can be a contributing factor to AKI, thus, indirectly suggesting a possible relationship between febuxostat and acute kidney injury. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the incidence frequency of this postmarketing adverse reaction is not clearly estimated, and a direct causal relationship to drug exposure is not definitively established.

Conclusion:
Based on the drug label information provided, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction directly related to febuxostat in clinical trials. However, the postmarketing surveillance section indirectly suggests a possible association with tubulointerstitial nephritis, which may contribute to AKI. Due to the nature of postmarketing reports, the causality and frequency of this association cannot be firmly established. Physicians prescribing febuxostat should monitor renal function as a precaution, especially in patients with pre-existing renal conditions or other risk factors that may predispose them to renal adverse events.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for febuxostat, there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials experience, postmarketing experience, common or rare adverse reactions, or in the warnings and precautions sections of the prescribing information. While the label does mention ""renal failure, renal insufficiency"" among renal and urinary disorders, this does not specifically address acute kidney injury.

The label indicates other adverse reactions affecting the renal system, such as hematuria, nephrolithiasis, proteinuria, and urine abnormalities. However, it does not explicitly refute the relationship between febuxostat and acute kidney injury.

To conclusively refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and febuxostat, scientific literature reviews, large-scale studies, or meta-analyses showing lack of association or causal relationship would be required. Due to the absence of any mentioned evidence specifically refuting AKI as an adverse reaction to febuxostat in the drug label, it can neither be confirmed nor denied based on the provided information.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections do not include refuting evidence for a relationship between acute kidney injury and febuxostat use. Additional research and reviews would be required to firmly establish the absence of this relationship."
acute kidney injury,febuxostat,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury is not listed among the most common adverse reactions directly associated with febuxostat (ULORIC) in the clinical trial data presented. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with febuxostat and at least 0.5% greater than placebo, included liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash.

However, under the section ""Renal and Urinary Disorders"" in less common adverse reactions, there are mentions of ""renal failure"" and ""renal insufficiency,"" which can be associated with acute kidney injury. It should be noted that these reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients and are not necessarily directly linked to febuxostat. Additionally, conditions such as renal failure and insufficiency are broad terms that can include various levels of kidney impairment, including but not limited to acute kidney injury.

No specific evidence from the provided sections of the drug label indicates a direct and well-established relationship between febuxostat and acute kidney injury. The post-marketing experience section does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury either, but it does note the occurrence of ""tubulointerstitial nephritis,"" which is a condition that may lead to or be a part of the spectrum of acute kidney damage.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections do not list acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction to febuxostat. The relationship between febuxostat and acute kidney injury, based on the given sections of the drug label, is not clearly established or widely reported. Patients with pre-existing kidney problems or risk factors for kidney disease may need careful monitoring while on febuxostat due to the potential for renal-related adverse effects.

For healthcare professionals, it is crucial to assess on a case-by-case basis, considering patients' unique risk factors and medical history, and to diligently monitor renal function as appropriate when prescribing febuxostat. If additional, more detailed information or recent data is required to establish this relationship, a search of the current medical literature, preclinical studies, and ongoing post-marketing surveillance data would be recommended.",NA
acute kidney injury,"fecal microbiota spores, live",,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label detailing the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings for the fecal microbiota therapy product referred to as VOWST, there is no explicit evidence listed that indicates acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction attributed to this treatment.

Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials for VOWS mostly revolved around gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal distension, fatigue, constipation, chills, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events reported among VOWST recipients did not point to any incidents considered related to VOWST. Moreover, renal impairment status was similar between the VOWST and placebo arms upon entry into the study, suggesting that pre-existing renal conditions were evenly distributed among the patients in both arms of the trial.

The warning sections focus on the potential transmission of infectious agents and the possible presence of food allergens due to the product's derivation from human fecal matter. Still, they do not mention kidney injury as a potential complication.

In conclusion, the drug label excerpts provided do not support any known evidence of acute kidney injury resulting from the use of VOWST. If there are any post-marketing surveillance reports or unpublished case studies that have documented AKI in the context of VOWST use, these were not part of the information provided and would require further investigation.

As for the practical implications, healthcare professionals should continue to vigilantly monitor for any unlisted adverse reactions related to VOWST use, including renal function, and report them as they arise to build a more comprehensive safety profile of the product.","Based on the provided drug label sections for VOWST, a fecal microbiota product for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction either in the listed most common adverse reactions (≥5% of participants) or in the serious adverse events section. Adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials, and at a frequency greater than placebos within 8 weeks post-administration, included abdominal distension, fatigue, constipation, chills, and diarrhea, with no mention of AKI. 

Serious adverse events among VOWST recipients did not appear to be related to the product. Furthermore, the drug label indicates specific adverse reactions and warnings but does not list AKI as a concern, even though populations with renal impairment were included in the study. This suggests that no direct evidence of a link between AKI and VOWST was observed in the clinical study population.

The evidence provided does not refute the relationship between AKI and VOWST; rather, it suggests that AKI has not been identified or reported as an adverse reaction within the context of the clinical trials referenced. AKI can be a multifactorial condition, and drug labels generally only report adverse reactions that have been both observed and determined to be at least possibly related to the drug.

In summary, based on the information provided, there is no evidence within the clinical trials or reported post-marketing surveillance that directly associates acute kidney injury with exposure to VOWST. Therefore, any concerns about a potential relationship between AKI and VOWST are not supported by the available clinical trial evidence stated in the drug label sections supplied."
acute kidney injury,felbamate,,"The provided sections from the drug label discuss various adverse reactions associated with felbamate use, however, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly mentioned in the adverse reactions, warnings, or post-marketing surveillance sections. Evidence from the label as provided does not suggest that AKI is a known adverse reaction to felbamate based on outcomes from controlled clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing reports documented here.

That said, the detailed sections of the label included do list ""acute renal failure"" under post-marketing adverse event reports, which by definition, is a type of acute kidney injury. It should be noted that this is reported voluntarily and in conjunction with other drugs, thus a direct causal relationship with felbamate cannot be reliably established from this data alone.

In conclusion, while the drug label for felbamate does not specifically list acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction based on clinical trials, it is mentioned in the context of post-marketing reports which include multiple drug use, and therefore, causality is uncertain. A thorough search of the literature and more extensive pharmacovigilance data would be required to determine if there is additional evidence to substantiate a relationship between felbamate use and the occurrence of acute kidney injury.","NA

The request for evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and felbamate exposure cannot be fulfilled with information available as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, because there is no claim or evidence provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, box warnings, or post-marketing surveillance sections of the drug label that suggests AKI is associated with felbamate. The summarized adverse reactions and warnings do not mention AKI as a known or observed concern."
acute kidney injury,fenofibrate,,"The relationship between fenofibrate exposure and acute kidney injury can be summarized based on the provided drug label sections.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
The section 6.1 of the drug label from clinical trials does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction in patients treated with fenofibrate. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment in clinical trials predominantly pertained to increases in liver function tests rather than direct renal issues.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
Section 6.2, describing the postmarketing experience, does indicate that acute renal failure has been identified as an adverse reaction during postapproval use of fenofibrate. However, it is noted that postmarketing observations are less controlled and may not establish a strong causal relationship due to less rigorous data collection and the voluntary nature of reporting.

**Serum Creatinine:**
Section 5.4 of the label mentions that fenofibrate can cause reversible increases in serum creatinine levels, which could potentially suggest an impact on kidney function. However, it is stated that the clinical significance of these observations is unknown, and there is no explicit linkage to acute kidney injury.

**Relevant Warnings and Precautions:**
There are no specific warnings or precautions within the provided drug label sections that directly link fenofibrate to acute kidney injury. However, renal function monitoring is advised in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those at risk for renal insufficiency (section 5.4).

In conclusion, the evidence from postmarketing surveillance does suggest a potential relationship between fenofibrate and acute kidney injury, but the evidence from clinical trials included in the drug label does not. The reversible increases in serum creatinine reported in the drug label may point to an effect of fenofibrate on renal function, but the evidence does not strongly establish acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction. Close monitoring of renal function in at-risk populations is suggested, which is consistent with caution in the use of many medications in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. 

To fully evaluate the evidence regarding acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to fenofibrate, a review of related scientific literature including case studies, additional clinical trial data, and robust postmarketing surveillance would be warranted. The drug label alone provides limited information on this specific adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,fenoprofen,1.0,"Summary of Evidence: Relationship Between Acute Kidney Injury and Fenoprofen Exposure

The drug label provided for fenoprofen (brand name Nalfon) includes a detailed section on Warnings and Precautions, with specific attention to the renal toxicity associated with its use. Fenoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and as noted in the label, NSAIDs as a class have been linked to renal toxicity.

Renal Toxicity (Section 5.6 of the label):
The label warns that long-term administration of NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, has been associated with renal injury, such as renal papillary necrosis. The risk is highest in patients with existing renal impairment, as well as those dealing with dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, or concurrent use of diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Acute kidney injury, which can result from this renal toxicity, could manifest as oliguria or anuria, increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, or renal failure itself. Conditions like interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal papillary necrosis are listed under adverse reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients during clinical trials.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
In clinical trial data presented in section 6.1 of the label, renal-related adverse reactions including renal failure, dysuria, cystitis, hematuria, oliguria, azotemia, anuria, interstitial nephritis, nephrosis, and papillary necrosis were reported in less than 1% of patients.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
While the label does not specifically mention acute kidney injury in the context of post-marketing surveillance, it is commonly understood that the renal side effects noted during clinical trials would also present in the post-marketing phase. Renal toxicity warnings suggest that such issues have been observed in practice beyond the initial clinical trials.

Conclusion:
There is evidence to support a relationship between fenoprofen exposure and the potential for acute kidney injury, as noted in the drug label's Warnings and Precautions, specifically under renal toxicity. Clinical trial data and the known pharmacologic action of NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, indicate that renal adverse effects are possible, although they occurred in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials. It is crucial for healthcare providers to recognize risk factors (such as existing renal impairment or use of concomitant medications that affect renal function) that increase the risk of renal toxicity in patients being prescribed fenoprofen.

When using fenoprofen, healthcare providers should monitor renal function, especially in patients with risk factors for renal impairment. Discontinuation of the drug is recommended if renal adverse reactions are observed. Patients should also be educated on the signs and symptoms of serious renal events when taking this medication.",NA
acute kidney injury,fentanyl,,"Acute kidney injury is not listed as a known adverse reaction to fentanyl in the sections provided, including adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings of the drug label. The given sections discuss various other serious adverse reactions such as addiction, abuse, misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, severe hypotension, and others. Common adverse reactions, such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue are mentioned, along with less common events like anemia, constipation, dehydration, headache, and somnolence. 

Clinical trials for fentanyl buccal tablets were conducted predominantly in opioid-tolerant cancer patients and did not explicitly report acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. Postmarketing surveillance does list renal failure under ""Renal and Urinary Disorders,"" but no specific association with acute kidney injury is mentioned here either.

In conclusion, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no reported evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that directly links fentanyl use to acute kidney injury. If such evidence exists outside the provided drug label, it has not been included or mentioned in the section that typically lists adverse reactions observed during clinical trials, nor in the warnings or post-marketing experience sections of this document.",NA
acute kidney injury,ferumoxytol,,"The provided drug label information for ferumoxytol indicates that acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported as a potential adverse reaction. Specifically, AKI is listed among the serious adverse events that were reported in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial involving patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). In this trial, patients were randomized to receive two intravenous infusions of ferumoxytol or ferric carboxymaltose (FCM).

The drug label describes that in ferumoxytol-treated patients, AKI was one of the most common serious adverse events occurring in at least two subjects, though it does not specify the exact frequency. This information suggests that there have been at least some clinical trial observations that support a potential link between ferumoxytol exposure and the development of AKI.

The detailed post-marketing experience does not explicitly mention AKI, but given that this information is voluntarily reported and may not reflect all experiences, it is possible that additional data has been gathered since the label was last updated.

However, to make a definitive statement on the causal relationship between ferumoxytol and AKI, additional information such as the overall incidence rate, baseline patient kidney function, concomitant medication use, and underlying health conditions would be necessary for a thorough evaluation.

To summarize, evidence from clinical trial data indicates that AKI has been reported as a serious adverse event in patients treated with ferumoxytol. However, the available information in the provided drug label does not offer enough detail to comprehensively assess causality or the overall risk of AKI due to ferumoxytol. Further study and detailed case assessment may be required to fully understand this relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,filgrastim,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction and filgrastim (GRANIX) is not directly described in the provided drug label sections. The listed adverse reactions in the sections provided include glomerulonephritis under ""Warnings and Precautions (5.5)"" which pertains to kidney function but is different from acute kidney injury (AKI).

Glomerulonephritis, a condition where the glomeruli within the kidneys become inflamed, can be an indicator of possible kidney complications due to the drug's exposure. The label advises evaluating patients if glomerulonephritis is suspected and to consider dose reduction or interruption of GRANIX if causality is likely, based on azotemia, hematuria, proteinuria, and renal biopsy findings. However, it should be noted that glomerulonephritis is not the same as acute kidney injury, which refers to a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days.

Acute kidney injury, as a specific adverse reaction, is not listed in the adverse reactions (section 6) or postmarketing experience (section 6.2) for adult or pediatric patients. In the clinical trial experiences with GRANIX, the adverse reactions mentioned for the sets of adult patients with various types of cancers and pediatric patients with solid tumors do not include acute kidney injury.

Given the sections of the label provided, there is no reported direct evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that specifically associates filgrastim with acute kidney injury. It is critical to refer to the full prescribing information and consult with healthcare professionals for a complete understanding of all potential adverse reactions associated with filgrastim use. Additionally, keep in mind that post-marketing surveillance might reveal adverse reactions not initially observed in clinical trials, but based on the information provided, acute kidney injury is not cited as one of them for filgrastim.",NA
acute kidney injury,filgrastim,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for filgrastim, evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and filgrastim use is not explicitly presented. Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to promote the production of neutrophils and is commonly used in various clinical settings such as cancer treatment, bone marrow transplantation, and severe chronic neutropenia.

The adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) and the warnings and precautions section (5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) discuss numerous potential adverse effects and safety concerns associated with filgrastim. Specific adverse effects noted include splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome, serious allergic reactions, sickle cell disorders, glomerulonephritis, and others, along with details about the clinical trials experience and post-marketing experience. However, there is no mention of acute kidney injury as a recognized complication.

Glomerulonephritis, a condition that involves inflammation of the tiny filters in the kidneys (glomeruli), is mentioned in section 6.3 Postmarketing Experience, and patients are advised to consider dose-reduction or interruption of filgrastim if causality is likely (5.5 Glomerulonephritis). While glomerulonephritis can potentially lead to AKI, this condition represents a distinct pathology and should not be confused with AKI as a direct adverse effect.

Post-marketing surveillance, as reported in sections 6.2 Immunogenicity and 6.3 Postmarketing Experience, does not provide any evidence of AKI specifically linked to filgrastim. However, it is possible that new evidence might emerge over time, and it is important for healthcare professionals to report any suspected adverse reactions in order to update the safety profile of the drug.

In summary, based on the provided labels, there is no clear evidence in the clinical trials data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that directly associates filgrastim use with acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. If forthcoming data provides new insights, then the label and recommendations may be updated accordingly.",NA
acute kidney injury,flucytosine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for Flucytosine Capsules USP, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure. The evidence for this adverse reaction comes from the listed side effects under the Genitourinary section of the label where ""azotemia, creatinine, and BUN elevation, crystalluria, renal failure"" are explicitly mentioned as adverse reactions observed during treatment with Flucytosine.

Furthermore, the warning section of the label advises using the drug with ""extreme caution in patients with impaired renal function"" and emphasizes the importance of ""close monitoring of hematologic, renal and hepatic status of all patients."" This serves as an indirect indication that kidney-related issues, including acute kidney injury, are of particular concern and are known potential risks associated with Flucytosine treatment.

The adverse reactions have likely been identified through a combination of clinical trial observations, post-marketing surveillance, and case studies, although the label does not specify which sources specifically reported renal failure or acute kidney injury. In clinical practice, the monitoring of kidney function is recommended to detect any signs of acute kidney injury promptly. Physicians are further instructed to report suspected adverse reactions to Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or the FDA, suggesting a system for ongoing post-marketing surveillance to gather additional safety data.

This summary is based solely on the provided sections of the Flucytosine drug label, and any in-depth analysis of the extent of the relationship between Flucytosine and acute kidney injury would require a review of the full range of available clinical data, including trial results, case studies, and post-marketing reports.",NA
acute kidney injury,fludarabine,,"Given the provided sections from the drug label for fludarabine, there isn't an explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a documented adverse reaction directly associated with fludarabine therapy in the context of clinical studies or post-marketing surveillance. However, drug labels are extensive and are updated as new information becomes available. They serve to guide healthcare professionals in the safe and effective use of medications.

Complications such as myelosuppression (which includes neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia), severe infections, neurotoxicity, autoimmune phenomena, and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) have indeed been associated with fludarabine use, as stated in the adverse reactions and box warnings sections. TLS can lead to metabolic abnormalities and has the potential to precipitate renal failure, which suggests an indirect relationship where AKI could occur secondary to TLS in patients with high tumor burdens being treated with fludarabine.

Interpreting the reported information, renal insufficiency is addressed in the context of dosing recommendations, wherein the drug should be administered cautiously to patients with renal impairment, and not administered to patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. Additionally, tumor lysis syndrome, which includes renal failure as a potential complication, is mentioned as a potential effect of therapy.

Without explicit data or case reports linking fludarabine directly to AKI, a strong relationship is not established in the label information. Nonetheless, the requirement of dose adjustment in renal impairment and the association with TLS indicate that renal function is an important consideration in patients receiving fludarabine, and AKI could be a possible secondary effect due to associated complications.

In conclusion, based on the drug label information provided, there is no direct evidence linking fludarabine to acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. However, indirect associations through complications such as tumor lysis syndrome point to the importance of renal monitoring during fludarabine therapy. For a comprehensive evaluation, a systematic review of the literature including clinical trials, case reports, and other post-marketing sources would be required to further assess the potential relationship between fludarabine and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,fluoxetine,,"The provided drug label sections for fluoxetine do not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the context of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing experience. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned in the sections detailing common adverse reactions, warnings, indications of organ-specific reactions, or in the broader list of post-marketing experiences.

However, post-marketing experience does include voluntary reports of a wide range of adverse events, some involving the kidneys, such as kidney failure. It is important to note that these reports are made on a voluntary basis and a direct causal relationship to drug exposure may not be established or may be uncertain. Additionally, because these reports come from a population of uncertain size, it is not feasible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to fluoxetine exposure.

Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence from clinical trials or case studies linking fluoxetine with acute kidney injury. While kidney failure is noted in the post-marketing experience, the specific condition of acute kidney injury is not detailed. It should be appreciated that post-marketing surveillance may capture a broader range of potential reactions that were not necessarily identified during pre-marketing clinical trials, but the evidence may not be as robust without controlled studies to substantiate these findings.

In summary, there is no clear evidence within the provided sections of the fluoxetine drug label to support a relationship between fluoxetine exposure and acute kidney injury. Any potential association regarding kidney-related adverse effects, specifically acute kidney injury, would likely require further investigation through epidemiological studies, comprehensive case reviews, or well-documented case reports to establish causality.",NA
acute kidney injury,fluphenazine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for fluphenazine, which is a typical antipsychotic medication, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a documented adverse reaction. However, the label does mention occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in patients on neuroleptic therapy, which includes fluphenazine. NMS is a serious condition associated with antipsychotic drugs, and one of the complications that may arise from NMS is acute kidney injury. This is likely due to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) leading to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can cause kidney damage.

Looking specifically at the section ""Other CNS Effects,"" it is noted that leukocytosis, elevated CPK (creatinine phosphokinase, which can be a marker of muscle breakdown), liver function abnormalities, and acute renal failure may occur with NMS. Acute renal failure, another term for acute kidney injury, implies a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. 

Therefore, while the direct evidence linking fluphenazine to AKI through routine administration is not explicitly stated, there is an indirect association through the potential complication of NMS, which is a recognized adverse reaction. It is reasonable to infer from the drug label that if a patient develops NMS while on fluphenazine, there is a risk for AKI among other serious complications.

Post-marketing surveillance is a valuable source of information for rare or late-onset side effects that may not be apparent in clinical trials. While the provided label does not specify any post-marketing data related to AKI, such surveillance data could contribute to understanding this potential adverse reaction if it were available. It is also conceivable that individual case studies or case reports could provide evidence of AKI associated with fluphenazine use, but such evidence is not provided in the label details here.

To fully ascertain the link between fluphenazine and acute kidney injury, one would have to evaluate the existing medical literature beyond the drug label, including case reports, observational studies, and other post-marketing data sources. As the drug label does not make an explicit connection, healthcare providers might need to report any instances of AKI observed in patients using fluphenazine to further contribute to the understanding of its safety profile.

In summary, while there is no direct evidence from clinical trials or the provided sections of the drug label that fluphenazine causes acute kidney injury, there is an indirect association through its potential to cause NMS, which can lead to AKI. Further investigation into post-marketing data and other medical literature would be necessary to establish a clearer relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,flurbiprofen,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. The listed adverse reactions primarily involve ocular symptoms, such as burning, stinging, irritation, fibrosis, hyphema, miosis, mydriasis, and ocular hyperemia. Additionally, there is a notice of an increased bleeding tendency of ocular tissues in conjunction with ocular surgery.

To evaluate the potential relationship between flurbiprofen and the risk of acute kidney injury, we would need to analyze evidence beyond the drug label, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance data.

Clinical Trials:
There may be clinical trial data assessing the safety and efficacy of flurbiprofen that includes monitoring for adverse renal effects. Such data would provide controlled information on the incidence of AKI in patients exposed to flurbiprofen compared to control groups.

Case Studies:
Case reports or case series might describe instances of AKI following the use of flurbiprofen. These would offer insights into individual experiences, although they may not establish causation.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
Pharmacovigilance databases and post-marketing surveillance reports may capture rare adverse events, including AKI, occurring after the drug has been approved and marketed. The FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is one such resource where healthcare providers and patients can report suspected adverse reactions.

As of the information included in the drug label shared, there is no reported evidence of a connection between flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution use and acute kidney injury. For a more comprehensive assessment, an evaluation of additional sources, as mentioned above, would be necessary. If such data sources also do not suggest a relationship, it could then be stated that there is no known evidence supporting the association between acute kidney injury and flurbiprofen exposure based on currently available data.

In the absence of specific sources and data points provided for clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance, it is not possible to offer a more precise summary in this response. However, healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities, such as the FDA or the drug manufacturer, to help in the continual monitoring of drug safety.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution, there is no mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. The listed adverse reactions primarily concern ocular symptoms such as burning, stinging, and irritation, along with a potential for increased bleeding tendency of ocular tissues in conjunction with ocular surgery.

Without specific evidence presented in the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings sections of the drug label that links flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution to acute kidney injury, it suggests that there is no recognized association between the drug and this particular adverse reaction in the context of its ophthalmic use.

It is important to note that this summary is strictly confined to the information provided from the drug label. Adverse reactions not listed on the label could potentially exist and would require a broader literature search and review of post-marketing surveillance data, clinical trials, or other scientific studies for any reports refuting or failing to show an association between flurbiprofen and acute kidney injury. 

However, for the specific request and based on the information given, there is no evidence to suggest a relationship between acute kidney injury and the use of flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution. Any further claims would need to be substantiated by additional sources not provided here."
acute kidney injury,fluvastatin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for fluvastatin, there is mention of various adverse reactions and warnings concerning myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, which could potentially lead to acute kidney injury. Here's the summary of evidence from the sections supplied:

1. **Rhabdomyolysis and Renal Failure**: 
The label explicitly warns of the serious adverse reaction of rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure. Rhabdomyolysis is the rapid breakdown of damaged muscle tissue, releasing myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can lead to acute kidney injury due to the harmful effects of myoglobin on the kidneys.

2. **Incidence in Clinical Trials**:
The label does not report instances of acute kidney injury itself within the summary of the fluvastatin clinical trials. However, the mention of rhabdomyolysis suggests that there could be a link between fluvastatin use and kidney injury, given the known complications of rhabdomyolysis.

3. **Post-marketing Surveillance**:
The label lists adverse reactions from post-marketing experience, including musculoskeletal effects like myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. There is no direct statement of acute kidney injury as an observed post-marketing adverse reaction. However, given that rhabdomyolysis is listed and can lead to acute kidney injury, there are potential grounds to consider a relationship between fluvastatin and kidney injury.

4. **Warnings and Precautions**: 
Section 5.1 of the warnings and precautions speaks to the risk of rhabdomyolysis with elevation in creatine kinase and subsequent acute renal failure. No specific data or incident rates are provided regarding kidney injury. It advises caution in populations with increased risk and recommends discontinuation if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.

In conclusion, while acute kidney injury is not directly cited as a frequent adverse reaction to fluvastatin, its association with rhabdomyolysis suggests an indirect link. The clinical trials for fluvastatin did not highlight acute kidney injury as a notable side effect. However, post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis could suggest a low-incidence potential for fluvastatin-related kidney injury in clinical practice. Monitoring for symptoms that could lead to acute kidney injury (such as muscle pain and weakness indicative of rhabdomyolysis) is advised in the warnings section of the label. Given the lack of direct mention of acute kidney injury, further observational studies or case reports might be necessary to establish a more precise association.",NA
acute kidney injury,fluvoxamine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for fluvoxamine, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, or case studies within the context of fluvoxamine use. The documented adverse reactions predominantly relate to gastrointestinal, nervous system, and sexual function disturbances. Acute renal failure is listed under postmarketing reports, which indicates that there have been instances reported after the drug was approved for use, where patients taking fluvoxamine experienced acute kidney injury. 

However, postmarketing reports do not establish a clear causal relationship between the drug and the adverse effect as this data depends on voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, and it is often not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Therefore, while acute kidney injury is mentioned in postmarketing reports, this does not constitute robust evidence of a causal relationship with fluvoxamine, as controlled clinical trials did not report this as a common adverse reaction.

It is important to note that postmarketing reports are a way for healthcare professionals and consumers to document adverse effects that may not have been evident during clinical trials. If acute kidney injury is suspected in the context of fluvoxamine use, it could warrant further investigation or reporting to regulatory agencies such as the FDA for assessment and potential inclusion in future label updates if the evidence supports a causal connection.

In conclusion, there is no clear evidence from clinical trials or controlled studies indicating that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction to fluvoxamine. Reports of acute renal failure have been identified in the postmarketing phase, but the evidence available does not establish causality and should be interpreted with caution. Healthcare providers should consider individual patient risk factors and clinical context when monitoring for potential kidney-related side effects in patients taking fluvoxamine.",NA
acute kidney injury,fondaparinux,,"The provided drug label information for Fondaparinux (a synthetic pentasaccharide anticoagulant) does not explicitly mention ""acute kidney injury"" as an adverse reaction from its use. Instead, the label discusses a different but related concern: ""Renal impairment and bleeding risk,"" under Warnings and Precautions (section 5.3). According to section 5.3, Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk of bleeding in patients with impaired renal function due to reduced clearance. The drug label also states that it should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min. Furthermore, for individuals with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min, prolonged anticoagulation may occur, warranting caution.

The drug label provides a table (Table 1) clarifying the incidence of major bleeding by renal function status in clinical trials. The Table indicates a higher incidence of major bleeding events in patients with worsening renal function who were receiving Fondaparinux. However, these bleeding risks are not directly equated to acute kidney injury but could potentially exacerbate pre-existing renal impairment.

To sum up the evidence provided in the drug label:

- Fondaparinux is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients with existing renal impairment.
- The anticoagulant effects of the drug may be prolonged in patients with reduced renal clearance, with explicit contraindications for use in patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min.
- Major bleeding events are more frequent in patients with renal impairment, as shown in clinical trials (Table 1).
- There is monitoring advice for patients via periodic blood counts, including platelet counts and serum creatinine level, to detect and manage potential complications related to renal function.

From the information provided, it is not possible to establish a direct causal relationship between Fondaparinux use and acute kidney injury simply based on the drug label. If you seek evidence outside of this label, such as from studies specifically investigating Fondaparinux and acute kidney injury, it would require a literature review to provide a research-backed summary. As of the drug label details, no direct evidence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to Fondaparinux is stated.",NA
acute kidney injury,foscarnet,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to support a relationship between foscarnet exposure and the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), along with other renal impairments and electrolyte disturbances:

1. Clinical Trials Evidence:
   - Data from a group of 189 patients with AIDS and cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis showed that approximately 33% developed significant impairment of renal function (serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL) when receiving foscarnet (60 mg/kg TID) without adequate hydration.
   - This incidence of renal impairment was reduced to 12% (34 out of 280 patients) in subsequent clinical trials when 1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution was administered with each infusion of foscarnet, indicating a potential mitigation strategy through proper hydration.
   - Additionally, in five controlled U.S. clinical trials, abnormal renal function was reported as a frequent adverse event, occurring in 27% of patients, and severe adverse renal function was reported in 14% of patients.
   - Table 12 from the CRRT study showed nephrotoxicity, with creatinine levels rising above 260 μmol/L (>2.9 mg/dL) in a number of patients across different treatment groups, including 7 events in the foscarnet monotherapy group.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - Reports in the post-marketing phase have also highlighted instances of nephrotoxicity, with acute renal failure included among the listed adverse reactions to foscarnet.
   - Other renal-related adverse events listed include changes in serum electrolytes with the potential for precipitating renal complications and instances of crystal-induced nephropathy.

3. Warnings:
   - Renal impairment is repeatedly emphasized as the major toxicity of foscarnet, with the drug label reinforcing the need for frequent monitoring of serum creatinine levels, dose adjustments based on renal function, and adequate hydration during administration.

Given the data stated in the product label, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, there is compelling evidence that foscarnet can cause AKI and other renal-related adverse effects. The consistency of these findings across different sources implies a well-established association that should be considered when prescribing foscarnet, with precautions including dose adjustments and monitoring of renal function to mitigate this risk.","NA

The drug label explicitly states that renal impairment is a major toxicity of foscarnet, with around 33% of patients developing significant impairment of renal function when not adequately hydrated. This information refutes the lack of a relationship between acute kidney injury and foscarnet exposure, affirming that there is indeed a connection between the two. Adverse reactions, warnings, and clinical trials support this finding."
acute kidney injury,fosinopril,,"The evidence to support the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and fosinopril, an ACE inhibitor, mainly comes from general knowledge about the class of ACE inhibitors, post-marketing surveillance, the pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs, and the adverse events reported in clinical trials.

Clinical Trials:
Within the provided drug label for fosinopril, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. During clinical trials for hypertension and heart failure, elevations in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed, which can be indicators of renal impairment, but these were usually transient and minor. Additionally, it was stated that no significant differences were evident in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
The data on adverse reactions from post-marketing experiences are typically collected through spontaneous reporting systems once the drug is widely used in the general population. In this case, acute renal failure is listed among other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors. However, the specific frequency or established causality of AKI due to fosinopril is not detailed in the provided sections.

ACE Inhibitors and Renal Function:
It is known from pharmacological studies that ACE inhibitors, like fosinopril, can affect renal function. They work by inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. While beneficial for many patients, they can also decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, renal artery stenosis, or those who are dehydrated. This decreased GFR can sometimes escalate to AKI, particularly with other contributing factors. Such risks are commonly communicated in the warnings or precautions sections of ACE inhibitors.

Warnings:
The label includes a general caution that rapid reduction in blood pressure—potentially resultant from any antihypertensive including fosinopril—can cause a decrease in GFR, leading to BUN and serum creatinine increases, an indirect indication of potential for renal injury.

Although acute kidney injury specifically is not explicitly mentioned as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial data provided, related indicators (e.g., increased serum creatinine) are noted, and AKI is recognized as a potential adverse effect in the broader context of ACE inhibitors based on the mechanism of action and the published literature.

In summary, while the provided label information does not explicitly establish a high frequency or direct causality between fosinopril use and AKI, there is an implicit relationship based on the pharmacologic effects of the drug class on renal function, supported by general knowledge of ACE inhibitors and the mechanisms by which they can lead to renal impairment under certain circumstances. For a definitive causality assessment, further investigation into post-marketing data, more detailed clinical trial outcomes, and pharmacovigilance reports would be necessary.","NA

The provided drug label indicates a range of adverse reactions, which do not explicitly refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and fosinopril exposure. The label acknowledges possible elevations in BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) or serum creatinine, both of which could indicate changes in kidney function, and it is a known fact that ACE inhibitors like fosinopril can occasionally affect kidney function. However, no explicit statement is made about acute kidney injury not being related to the drug. Therefore, based on the drug label information given, I cannot provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney and fosinopril. To provide a conclusive assessment, data from additional scientific studies or post-marketing surveillance specifically addressing this question would be needed."
acute kidney injury,fosphenytoin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to fosphenytoin is not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections.

The drug label mentions various adverse reactions and serious complications related to the administration of fosphenytoin, such as cardiovascular risks associated with rapid infusion, hematopoietic complications, serious dermatologic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), hepatotoxicity, and others. It also outlines the most common adverse reactions such as pruritus, nystagmus, dizziness, somnolence, and ataxia.

However, based on the sections provided, there is no direct evidence or mention of AKI being a known adverse reaction of fosphenytoin in the clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, or the listed warnings and precautions.

When administering fosphenytoin, monitoring is recommended for various complications, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when infused rapidly, but renal function is not specifically addressed.

In clinical practice, it's vital to be vigilant for any unlisted or unexpected adverse events, including renal complications like AKI. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate medical authorities (such as the FDA in the United States) to facilitate post-marketing surveillance that could identify additional risks associated with the drug in the broader patient population.

If AKI is suspected to be associated with fosphenytoin in a clinical setting, it should be reported and further investigated to establish a possible link, but based on the information provided, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between AKI and fosphenytoin exposure.",NA
acute kidney injury,fulvestrant,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and labeling, there is no direct evidence linking acute kidney injury specifically as an adverse reaction to fulvestrant. The clinical trial experiences with fulvestrant included in the drug label do not list acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction in the various studies and comparisons conducted (such as the CONFIRM trial, FALCON trial, Studies 0020 and 0021, PALOMA-3, MONARCH 2, and MONALEESA-3).

The adverse reactions observed in the trials and reported in patients receiving fulvestrant were more commonly associated with injection site reactions, gastrointestinal discomfort, fatigue, liver enzyme elevations, hematological effects (such as neutropenia and leukopenia), and musculoskeletal pain, among others.

Furthermore, in the section concerning the safety of fulvestrant plus abemaciclib versus fulvestrant plus placebo (MONARCH 2 trial), acute kidney injury is mentioned as an adverse reaction that led to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving the combination treatment but only in a very small percentage (0.2%). However, this does not establish a direct and consistent relationship between fulvestrant alone and acute kidney injury.

The label details that fulvestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment but should be used at a reduced dose in those with moderate hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairments can sometimes have secondary effects on kidney function, though this is a general consideration and not specific evidence of fulvestrant-induced acute kidney injury.

Postmarketing experiences with the drug do not include acute kidney injury in the list of adverse reactions reported infrequently.

In summary, the provided label information and summary of clinical trials does not support a direct relationship between fulvestrant and acute kidney injury. Any observed cases of acute kidney injury in patients receiving fulvestrant may be due to other factors or underlying conditions, and further investigation would be required to establish a causal link.",NA
acute kidney injury,gabapentin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and gabapentin (marketed as HORIZANT) within the listed adverse reactions, warnings, or post-marketing experiences. The adverse reactions detailed in the label include various nervous system disorders such as somnolence, dizziness, and headache, gastrointestinal complaints like nausea, and other issues such as fatigue, depression, and peripheral edema. Additionally, there are specific warnings about the potential for increased suicidal behavior and ideation, effects on driving, and respiratory depression, especially when combined with CNS depressants or in patients with respiratory impairment.

Of note, the Warnings and Precautions section of the label describes Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, which could potentially involve kidney injury. However, the document does not specifically mention AKI as a known adverse reaction or outcome of this condition in the context of gabapentin use.

The Postmarketing Experience section lists other adverse reactions reported after approval of the drug, such as breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, and bullous pemphigoid. However, AKI is not explicitly mentioned among these postmarketing reports.

It is worth mentioning that the absence of specific mention of AKI in these sections does not entirely rule out the possibility of gabapentin being associated with kidney injury. Post-marketing surveillance could potentially reveal a broader range of adverse effects as more people use the medication outside of clinical trial settings, and AKI could potentially be identified in the future as more data become available.

In conclusion, while AKI is not listed as a known adverse reaction to gabapentin in the provided sections of the drug label, continued pharmacovigilance and post-marketing surveillance could uncover a wider range-of drug-related complications. If concerns about gabapentin and kidney injury arise, healthcare professionals should report this through appropriate channels such as the FDA MedWatch program.",NA
acute kidney injury,gabapentin,,"The information provided from the drug label of gabapentin indicates that while a range of adverse reactions are associated with its use, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not listed specifically as a recognized adverse event within clinical trial data or postmarketing experience sections. Commonly reported adverse effects from clinical trials include dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema for postherpetic neuralgia; somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus for epilepsy in patients over 12 years old; and viral infection, fever, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility for pediatric epilepsy patients aged 3 to 12 years.

In the postmarketing experience section, the label references instances of elevated creatine kinase and elevated liver function tests, but there is no specific mention of AKI. It’s important to note that within the postmarketing surveillance data, adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, which does not always allow for a reliable estimate of their frequency or the establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Therefore, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no concrete evidence within the clinical trials or reported postmarketing experience to support a direct relationship between gabapentin use and acute kidney injury.

It is crucial for healthcare professionals to monitor for unreported adverse reactions and consider the entire clinical context when observing unusual symptoms in patients taking gabapentin, including potential renal issues. If there are research studies, case reports, or additional pharmacovigilance data that were not included within this drug label information, these sources could potentially yield more insight into the relationship between gabapentin and AKI. Without such data presented here, it's necessary to conclude that, according to this label information, a link between gabapentin and acute kidney injury is not established.",NA
acute kidney injury,galantamine,,"Based on the provided text from the drug label's sections pertaining to adverse reactions and postmarketing experience, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction associated with the use of galantamine. The common adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial section (6.1) and the postmarketing experience (6.2) focus primarily on neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and skin-related effects.

The listed adverse reactions from clinical trials with a prevalence of ≥1% in galantamine-treated patients include gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; nervous system disorders such as dizziness, headache, and syncope; cardiac disorders like bradycardia; and other general disorders. Additionally, postmarketing experiences identify other adverse reactions like seizures, extrapyramidal disorder, and various cardiovascular conditions.

The precautions and warnings sections bring attention to the potential for serious skin reactions, cardiac effects, gastrointestinal bleeding, genitourinary conditions, neurological conditions, and pulmonary complications. However, renal-related adverse effects or acute kidney injury are not highlighted in these sections.

To summarize, there is no stated evidence in the provided sections of the drug label connecting galantamine exposure to the occurrence of acute kidney injury. This means that either acute kidney injury is not a recognized adverse reaction of galantamine based on the available clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance, or it has not been reported at a frequency that would merit inclusion in those sections of the label. If information regarding an association between galantamine and acute kidney injury is required, it would be necessary to perform a more extensive review of the medical literature, clinical trial databases, postmarketing surveillance data, and renal-specific adverse event reports.",NA
acute kidney injury,gallium,,"Based on the provided drug label sections referring to adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings for Gallium (commercially known as Ganite), there is evidence suggesting a possible relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and drug exposure to gallium nitrate, particularly used in the treatment of cancer-related hypercalcemia.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
- Renal adverse effects, as indicated by increased Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, were reported in approximately 12.5% of patients treated with Ganite.
- In a controlled clinical trial with cancer-related hypercalcemia patients, two patients treated with Ganite and one patient receiving calcitonin developed acute renal failure. The direct relationship between these renal events and Ganite was not clear due to the seriousness of the patients' conditions.

Evidence from Case Studies:
- Case reports of acute kidney injury with gallium nitrate usage are not explicitly detailed in the provided sections.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- No specific data from post-marketing surveillance is mentioned in the provided sections. However, the label does caution that concurrent use of gallium nitrate with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of severe renal insufficiency.

Additional Notes:
- The drug label indicates a contraindication for Ganite treatment in patients with serum creatinine levels greater than 2.5 mg/dL, suggesting concern for renal function deterioration with the drug’s use.
- It is also recommended to discontinue Gallium nitrate if serum creatinine exceeds 2.5 mg/dL during treatment and to monitor renal function closely if nephrotoxic drugs are used concurrently with Gallium.

Given the above evidence, it can be cautiously inferred that there is an association between gallium nitrate treatment and the risk of acute kidney injury, although definitive causation is not clearly established due to confounding factors such as the presence of pre-existing severe illness in the patient population. Further investigations, like additional controlled clinical studies and more comprehensive post-marketing data analysis, would be necessary to establish a clearer causal relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,ganciclovir,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and ganciclovir exposure is derived from several sources as detailed in the provided drug label sections:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Increased blood creatinine levels were reported as a common laboratory abnormality in at least 20% of patients undergoing treatment with ganciclovir, indicating potential renal impairment (Section 6.1).
   - In controlled trials for the treatment of CMV retinitis, ganciclovir was associated with serum creatinine ≥2.5 levels in 21% of patients receiving the injection, compared to those taking ganciclovir capsules (Section Table 3).
   - In transplant recipients, elevated serum creatinine levels were also observed, with a notable increase in cases where patients had ≥2.5 mg/dL creatinine after receiving ganciclovir for injection (18% in the heart allograft ICM 1496 trial) (Section Table 5).

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Renal and urinary disorders captured during post-approval usage of ganciclovir for injection or capsules include kidney failure and renal function abnormalities, suggesting a connection between ganciclovir and adverse kidney outcomes (Section 6.2).

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   - The drug label explicitly warns about renal impairment, indicating that increased serum creatinine levels have been observed in patients. Particular emphasis is placed on the elderly and those receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, with a recommendation to monitor renal function and adjust dosing in patients with renal impairment (Section 5.2).

These sections of the drug label suggest that AKI is indeed a potential adverse reaction of ganciclovir, especially given the direct mentioning of increased serum creatinine levels, which are a marker of kidney function, and the need for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. The clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data imply a causal relationship between ganciclovir exposure and renal impairment, with AKI as a likely clinical manifestation. However, it is important to also consider individual patient factors, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, and underlying health conditions that may also contribute to the risk of AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,gemcitabine,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and gemcitabine exposure is limited within the provided drug label sections. The main adverse reactions described in gemcitabine clinical trials include hematologic toxicities such as anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; increased liver enzymes; nausea/vomiting; fever; proteinuria; and hematuria. Renal dysfunction is less commonly reported, and when it occurs, it is typically not the most prominent adverse effect. 

The drug label mentions renal toxicity in the context of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) within the Warnings and Precautions section (5.4). HUS can result in renal failure and has been observed in 0.25% of patients based on clinical trial data. The label advises monitoring renal function before starting and during treatment with gemcitabine, and it recommends discontinuation of the therapy in patients who develop HUS or severe renal impairment. 

However, there is no explicit mention of AKI as a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to gemcitabine. AKI might be a component or final consequence of severe cases of HUS, but it is not delineated as a standalone adverse event in this drug label.

It is worth noting that renal dysfunction is listed among the reasons that led to the discontinuation of gemcitabine in less than 1% of the 979 patients in clinical trials (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience).

To provide a more comprehensive assessment, a review of other sources such as published case reports, additional clinical trial data, and post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary. Without reviewing this additional literature, it is not possible to make a more definitive statement on the relationship between gemcitabine and AKI. 

In conclusion, based solely on the provided drug label, there is limited evidence of AKI as a direct adverse reaction to gemcitabine, although renal dysfunction including severe cases like HUS leading to renal failure has been observed and is appropriately cautioned within the drug's warnings and precautions.",NA
acute kidney injury,gemifloxacin,,"The provided drug label sections for gemifloxacin (FACTIVE®) do not specifically list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data. The evidence associated with the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury and gemifloxacin exposure can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials: 
In the clinical trials mentioned, patients treated with gemifloxacin did exhibit laboratory changes that included increased serum creatinine (0.2%), which can be an indicator of impaired kidney function. However, acute kidney injury as a distinct clinical adverse event is not explicitly stated.

Post-Marketing Surveillance: 
The post-marketing adverse reaction section of the label mentions renal failure, which represents a severe form of kidney impairment and could potentially encompass cases of acute kidney injury. Nevertheless, the frequency or a direct causal relationship to gemifloxacin exposure is not reliably estimated or established due to voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size.

Warnings:
Although the 'WARNING' section details several serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones, such as tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects, it does not specifically include acute kidney injury.

Based on the evidence provided in the drug label, there is a documented increase in serum creatinine levels observed in a small percentage of patients, which suggests that some degree of kidney impairment may occur. Acute kidney injury as a clinical diagnosis, however, is not distinctly reported or quantified in relation to gemifloxacin exposure in the available data. It is important to consider that post-marketing reports mention renal failure but due to the nature of voluntary reporting in a post-marketing context, causality is not definitively established.

For a thorough assessment of the potential risk of acute kidney injury associated with gemifloxacin, additional sources of data such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and more extensive post-marketing surveillance reports would need to be reviewed. Since the provided label sections do not give definitive evidence linking gemifloxacin to acute kidney injury, it is advisable to consult further medical literature and pharmacovigilance databases for any additional information that may provide a clearer understanding of this potential adverse event.",NA
acute kidney injury,gilteritinib,,"The drug label for gilteritinib, which is marketed under the brand name XOSPATA, reports renal impairment as one of the most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) during clinical trials. Specifically, renal impairment was noted in 21% of the 319 patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) treated with gilteritinib at a dose of 120 mg daily across three clinical trials. Additionally, 8% of these patients experienced a serious adverse reaction of renal impairment.

It is important to note that ""renal impairment"" can encompass a range of kidney-related issues, including acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the label does not explicitly detail acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction but includes it within the broader classification of renal impairment.

Of the patients studied, a subset required dose interruption due to an adverse reaction, and while the drug label does not specify AKI as the reason for these interruptions, renal impairment was one of the leading reasons for both dose interruption and discontinuation of the drug.

The label does not provide specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data regarding the incidence of acute kidney injury in association with gilteritinib. Moreover, while clinical trial data suggest a notable presence of renal impairment among treated patients, it lacks detailed breakdown which could definitively categorize AKI as a direct adverse reaction to gilteritinib.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials indicates a relationship between renal impairment and gilteritinib exposure, with a significant proportion of patients experiencing this condition. Acute kidney injury might be inferred as part of this broader category, but additional data or specific mention of AKI in the label or other studies would be required to establish a direct connection. For definitive information on AKI as an isolated adverse event, a further review of post-marketing data, more detailed clinical trial breakdowns, or new research would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,glatiramer,,"Based on the provided drug label information for glatiramer acetate—a medication commonly used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis—there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an identified adverse reaction either in the controlled clinical trials or in the post-marketing experience.

The adverse reactions described in the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1 of the drug label) and the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2) do not report acute kidney injury among the listed side effects. However, laboratory analyses in controlled clinical trials did include urinalysis, and no clinically significant differences between glatiramer acetate and placebo groups were noted.

The postmarketing experience section does list a variety of adverse reactions discovered after the drug was approved and made available to a broader population. Within the Urogenital System category, kidney failure is mentioned, implying some renal adverse events have been reported. However, ""acute kidney injury"" as a specific term is not cited, and there is no detailed information on the causality or frequency of kidney-related issues linked to glatiramer acetate use in this section.

Regarding potential effects on the immune response (Section 5.4), the drug label cautions that glatiramer acetate can modify the immune response, and while it raises concerns about potential glomerular deposition of immune complexes inspired by animal studies, it does not directly link this phenomenon to clinically significant renal dysfunction in humans.

In summary, as of the data cut off for this drug label information, there is no direct evidence outlined in the label to support a specific association between acute kidney injury and the use of glatiramer acetate. Further surveillance, research, and detailed case studies would be needed to establish a definitive relationship between the drug and acute kidney injury. It is important for healthcare providers to remain vigilant for any new data that may emerge regarding drug safety and to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate drug safety monitoring programs.",NA
acute kidney injury,goserelin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ZOLADEX (goserelin), there is no direct evidence listed that suggests an association between ZOLADEX and the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions detailed in the label for men and women, including those treated for breast cancer, dysfunctional uterine bleeding or endometriosis, do not include acute kidney injury.

The summarized adverse reactions focus largely on the expected physiological effects from decreased testosterone levels in men (hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, decreased erections, lower urinary tract symptoms) and hypoestrogenism-related effects in women (hot flushes, headache, sweating, emotional lability, depression, decreased libido, etc.). Tumor flare is mentioned, which manifests as temporary worsening of cancer-related pain, but no direct mention is made of kidney complications.

In the UROGENITAL section of adverse reactions reported in greater than 1% but less than 5% of the patients treated with ZOLADEX, 'renal insufficiency' is mentioned, but this term does not specifically refer to acute kidney injury and could encompass a variety of kidney-related issues.

Under the postmarketing experience section, various adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of ZOLADEX, including those affecting bone, cardiovascular, and metabolic systems, but acute kidney injury is not specifically listed.

Therefore, according to the label information provided, there is no provided evidence to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to ZOLADEX (goserelin). It's essential to refer to the most current and comprehensive medical literature, pharmacovigilance databases, and clinical trial data for any updates or additional information that may relate to this topic.",NA
acute kidney injury,guanfacine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury is mentioned under the rare and serious disorders with no definitive cause and effect relationship to guanfacine in the postmarketing experience. This indicates that there have been spontaneous reports of acute renal failure, which is synonymous with acute kidney injury; however, the relationship between guanfacine exposure and this adverse event has not been clearly established.

When drugs are approved and marketed, postmarketing surveillance is crucial to identify adverse reactions that were not apparent during clinical trials. This may include rare but serious adverse reactions such as acute kidney injury. The mention of acute renal failure in the postmarketing study suggests that there have been cases reported, but given the lack of a definitive cause and effect relationship, the evidence to support guanfacine as a direct cause of acute kidney injury remains circumstantial.

No specific incidents or case studies are noted in the label to provide analytical substance for associating guanfacine with acute kidney injury. Furthermore, the clinical trials and dose-response studies did not report renal-related adverse reactions as common occurrences. Therefore, while there is a potential signal for acute kidney injury in the context of guanfacine use based on postmarketing surveillance, the evidence does not establish a strong or definitive causal relationship.

In summary, there is an indication of acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction to guanfacine from postmarketing data, but the available evidence does not confirm a cause and effect relationship, and the incidence appears to be rare. Health care professionals should monitor patients for signs of kidney dysfunction and consider the possibility of acute kidney injury among the spectrum of adverse events potentially associated with guanfacine. However, further studies or case reviews would be needed to establish a more definitive causal link.","NA

The provided drug label information does not include acute kidney injury as a documented adverse reaction to guanfacine. However, rare cases of acute renal failure, a condition related to acute kidney injury, have been reported in the postmarketing study without a definitive cause and effect relationship to guanfacine established. Without direct evidence refuting acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to guanfacine, it is not possible to definitively conclude that acute kidney injury is unrelated to guanfacine use. Further investigation, such as epidemiological studies or clinical trials specifically designed to evaluate renal function, would be required to establish a lack of association."
acute kidney injury,heparin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction specifically associated with heparin in either the ""Adverse Reactions"" or the ""Warnings and Precautions"" sections. The adverse reactions and complications described in these segments of the drug label primarily revolve around bleeding events, hemostatic disruptions (like thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/thrombosis), hypersensitivity reactions, and other specific conditions such as osteoporosis and elevations of liver enzymes following the administration of heparin.

Furthermore, in the ""Postmarketing Experience"" portion, a wide range of complications and side effects are reported based on voluntary submissions from post-approval use, which include various types of hemorrhage, histamine-like reactions, hypersensitivity, and hematologic issues. Still, acute kidney injury is not explicitly documented.

It's important to note that the absence of acute kidney injury on the drug label does not unequivocally rule out its occurrence as an adverse event; it may not be a commonly reported or well-recognized complication associated with heparin. Clinical trials, case studies, or other pharmacovigilance data sources not provided with your query might offer additional insights or evidence regarding the relationship between heparin and acute kidney injury.

To sum up, based on the sections of the drug label you have provided, there is no known evidence within these documents supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and the exposure to heparin. Additional evidence from scientific studies or reports would have to be reviewed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of such a potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,human vaccinia immune globulin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for human vaccinia immune globulin (VIGIV), acute kidney injury as a specific adverse reaction to VIGIV is mentioned in warning section 5.2, indicating a recognition of the potential risk associated with the drug. Here is the evidence summarized from the provided text:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the adverse reactions section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience), the drug label describes the results from clinical trials in which the most frequently reported adverse reactions related to VIGIV administration were headache, nausea, rigors, and dizziness. There is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury within the summary of clinical trial experiences.

Case Studies and Post-marketing Surveillance:
In the post-marketing experience section (6.2), the label indicates that severe vaccinia infection associated with possible intravascular hemolysis and transient renal injury has been reported. Though not explicitly called acute kidney injury, ""transient renal injury"" may encompass acute kidney injury, suggesting that there have been instances where VIGIV administration may have been temporally associated with renal complications. However, the exact frequency or causality cannot be established reliably due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports.

Warnings:
In the warnings section (5), it is advised that VIGIV should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency and in those at risk of developing renal insufficiency, including those receiving known nephrotoxic drugs. The label explicitly mentions ""Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure"" under warnings regarding acute renal dysfunction/failure (5.2), suggesting that there is a known risk of these issues which could presumably include acute kidney injury.

In summary, while the clinical trials primarily reported headaches, nausea, rigors, and dizziness as adverse events, the warnings and post-marketing surveillance sections suggest that VIGIV may have a potential risk for causing renal-related adverse events, including acute kidney injury. This association seems to be more so highlighted as a risk within the label's warning sections rather than a common occurrence in past clinical trials, and it is recognized in instances reported post-marketing, albeit without robust frequency or causality data. The concern for acute kidney injury is noted enough to be specifically mentioned as a caution, indicating that the relation between VIGIV and acute kidney injury is plausible and warrants careful monitoring.",NA
acute kidney injury,hydrochlorothiazide,1.0,"Evidence suggesting a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and hydrochlorothiazide comes from post-marketing surveillance, as the drug label indicates renal failure and renal dysfunction as identified adverse reactions. Although it does not specifically list ""acute kidney injury,"" renal failure and renal dysfunction can be interpreted as manifestations of AKI. This implies that instances of AKI have been observed in patients taking hydrochlorothiazide, although the frequency and the establishment of a causal relationship might not be clear due to the nature of voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size.

Interstitial nephritis, which is listed under the ""Renal"" subheading of the adverse reactions in the drug label, is a known cause of acute kidney injury. While interstitial nephritis is not synonymous with AKI, it is a condition that can lead to AKI, suggesting a link between hydrochlorothiazide use and the potential for AKI to occur as a secondary adverse effect.

Clinical trials have not reported AKI as a common adverse reaction, but clinical trial settings are usually controlled and may not fully represent the variability found in the broader patient population. Moreover, the clinical trials mentioned in the drug label do not report significant adverse reactions with low doses of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg daily), but AKI is noted at higher doses (25 mg and above).

The absence of a Boxed Warning or specific mention in the Warnings section for AKI suggests that while the risk is recognized, it may not be considered a predominant risk in comparison to other potential adverse reactions of hydrochlorothiazide.

In summary, while the drug label and post-marketing data suggest that there is some evidence of a relationship between hydrochlorothiazide exposure and acute kidney injury, the extent of this relationship is not well-defined in the label. The potential for AKI appears to be associated with higher doses and might manifest through conditions such as interstitial nephritis. However, the precise incidence and causal relationship of AKI with hydrochlorothiazide use are not clearly established in the data provided. Further information would require access to detailed post-marketing surveillance data, additional clinical trials, or observational studies specifically investigating the occurrence of AKI in patients taking hydrochlorothiazide.",NA
acute kidney injury,hydroxocobalamin,,"As of my last knowledge update in March 2023, there is no widely recognized evidence or established causal relationship between the use of hydroxocobalin and acute kidney injury reported in the scientific literature. Hydroxocobalamin is a form of vitamin B12 used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency and in the management of cyanide poisoning.

In reviewing the adverse reactions provided for hydroxocobalamin, common side effects include mild transient diarrhea, itching, transitory exanthema (skin rash), a feeling of the swelling of the entire body, and anaphylaxis. Additionally, a few patients may experience pain after injection.

Evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking hydroxocobalamin to acute kidney injury was not mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label. Moreover, my training data does not include a known direct link between the drug and acute kidney injury.

However, it is essential to note that this does not entirely rule out a potential connection, as not all adverse reactions are known immediately following the approval of a drug and may be identified later through post-marketing surveillance or additional research. Thus, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse events to entities such as Actavis or the FDA to help identify and assess potential new risks associated with a medication.

Healthcare providers should always remain vigilant for any signs of new or unexpected side effects in their patients, especially those involving critical functions such as renal health. In the case of suspected adverse reactions, prompt reporting and further investigation may be necessary to establish a causal relationship.

To obtain the most current information, an examination of the latest scientific research, further review of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, and updated drug labeling would be required.",NA
acute kidney injury,ibandronate,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction attributed to ibandronate in the provided sections of the drug label. The summary and analysis of the adverse reactions from clinical trials focus on musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and respiratory systems, but do not specifically include renal system side effects like acute kidney injury.

In the sections of the drug label provided, under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" subsection, various adverse reactions are listed, such as hypersensitivity reactions, hypocalcemia, musculoskeletal pain, jaw osteonecrosis, and atypical femoral shaft fracture. Additionally, there are warnings and precautions related to upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions, hypocalcemia, severe bone/joint/muscle pain, jaw osteonecrosis, and atypical femur fractures, as well as a specific note on severe renal impairment suggesting that ibandronate sodium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min). However, acute kidney injury as a specific entity is not mentioned.

Given this information, there is no cited evidence within the provided drug label sections to suggest that exposure to ibandronate is directly associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury. However, this does not preclude the possibility of AKI occurring in practice given the drug's warning against use in severe renal impairment, which suggests the need for caution in patients with compromised kidney function. For comprehensive evaluation, it would be advised to review the full drug label, pharmacovigilance data, and scientific literature for any additional reports or data that might implicate ibandronate in the development of acute kidney injury.","The evidence provided in the drug label does not list acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction of ibandronate. The included adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections focus on upper gastrointestinal reactions, hypocalcemia, severe bone/joint/muscle pain, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures, and severe renal impairment as potential concerns, but acute kidney injury is not mentioned.

However, it is important to note that the warning section 5.6 states that ibandronate sodium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment, which indicates that kidney function is considered when prescribing this medication. This precaution suggests that the drug is known to be problematic in patients with existing renal issues but does not directly refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and ibandronate.

Since there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury in the sections provided, and the literature search is not available to me, I cannot confirm evidence either supporting or refuting a direct relationship between acute kidney injury and ibandronate use. It is possible that the connection between ibandronate and acute kidney injury has not been established or reported sufficiently to prompt inclusion in the drug label.

For concrete evidence refuting the relationship, one would have to consult additional sources such as renal function safety data from clinical trials, epidemiological studies, or systematic reviews that assess the occurrence of renal adverse reactions in relation to ibandronate treatment. However, these sources are not included in the provided information. Therefore, based on the available data in the label, there is no evidence either supporting or refuting the relationship, and no acute kidney injury is cited as an adverse reaction of ibandronate."
acute kidney injury,ibuprofen,1.0,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of ibuprofen is supported by evidence listed under the ""RENAL"" section of adverse reactions in the drug label provided. It states that renal adverse effects such as acute renal failure, decreased creatinine clearance, polyuria, azotemia, cystitis, and hematuria have been observed. Additionally, renal papillary necrosis is mentioned as a less frequent event but is nonetheless recognized. This information under ""Probable Causal Relationship"" signifies that there is at least one positive rechallenge or three or more cases that might be causally related to ibuprofen exposure.

The clinical trials, which included about 3,000 patients, with more than 500 treated for at least 54 weeks, have found these renal adverse reactions to occur, and based on this data, there is a grounded suspicion of ibuprofen's potential to cause AKI. The specific incidence of these reactions is not stated, but they are mentioned to be less than 1%, which still indicates a likely causal relationship with ibuprofen.

Post-marketing surveillance is another source of evidence for the relationship between ibuprofen and potential kidney injury. Adverse reactions reported from marketing experience are considered when listing events under the column for probable causal relationships, implying that observations made during the post-approval use of the drug support the connection between ibuprofen and renal events.

While the drug label does not contain the detailed data from the clinical trials or the individual case reports from the post-marketing surveillance, it integrates these findings into the approved labeling information, which reflects regulatory assessment and acknowledgment of the evidence linking ibuprofen to renal side effects, including acute kidney injury. The label also emphasizes the need for precautions in patients with pre-existing renal conditions and underlines that these adverse reactions can occur without warning.

Therefore, there is clear evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences that indicates ibuprofen can cause adverse renal reactions, including acute kidney injury, corroborated by regulatory assessment, as reflected in the drug's label.","NA

Acute kidney injury is listed as an adverse reaction in the section ""RENAL"" in the provided drug label excerpt. It specifically states ""Acute renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS),"" suggesting that there is a recognized potential for ibuprofen to cause acute kidney injury. As a result, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and ibuprofen exposure, according to the provided label information."
acute kidney injury,ibutilide,,"Based on the relevant sections of the drug label you provided for ibutilide (CORVERT), the evidence for acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction to the drug seems to be minimal but present. Specifically, the label mentions renal failure, which encompasses acute kidney injury (AKI), as one of the adverse events with an uncertain relationship to CORVERT, occurring in 0.3% of patients. This incidence rate is limited to this reporting and does not establish a strong causal relationship on its own.

The adverse reactions section does not mention AKI directly, but renal failure is included in the list of clinically important adverse events with an uncertain relationship to CORVERT. As renal failure can include AKI, this suggests that there might be a potential association. However, the term ""uncertain relationship"" implies that the available data do not allow for a definitive conclusion to be drawn regarding causality based on the clinical trials data alone.

In terms of the strength of evidence:

1. Clinical Trials: In the phase II/III studies referenced, renal failure (which could include AKI) was reported at a rate of 0.3%. However, without more detailed information on these cases, it is difficult to establish a direct link between ibutilide exposure and AKI.

2. Case Studies: No specific case studies were mentioned in the provided label sections, so no additional information from this source is available for evaluation.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance: The label does not provide specific details or quantified data from post-marketing surveillance regarding AKI associated with ibutilide.

Overall, while there is a mention of renal failure in the adverse reactions section of the drug label, the evidence does not strongly establish AKI as a common adverse reaction to ibutilide. Further investigation, such as more detailed case reports or post-marketing studies, would be necessary to clarify this potential relationship.

In summary, there is a mention of renal failure in a small number of patients treated with ibutilide, but the evidence does not clearly establish acute kidney injury as a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to the drug. If more details or studies become available, it would be necessary to reassess this possible association.","NA

Based on the information provided in the drug label sections for adverse reactions, warnings, and the box warning, acute kidney injury is not listed among the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance for ibutilide (CORVERT). Renal failure is mentioned; however, it is reported with a low incidence (0.3%), and it is not specified whether this could be categorized as acute kidney injury or a different form of renal impairment. Moreover, the drug label does not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and ibutilide administration, nor does it provide evidence to support the lack thereof. Therefore, given the lack of direct evidence refuting the claim and the drug label's failure to list acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction, it is not possible to conclusively state that acute kidney injury is not related to ibutilide. Further investigation, such as clinical studies or epidemiological research, would be required to definitively refute or confirm such a relationship."
acute kidney injury,ifosfamide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and ifosfamide exposure is documented in both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. The drug label for ifosfamide, under section 5.3 ""Renal and Urothelial Toxicity and Effects,"" explicitly states that ifosfamide therapy has been associated with nephrotoxicity, including reports of acute tubular necrosis, acute renal failure, and chronic renal failure. The drug labeling indicates that such renal dysfunction can manifest as a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, increased serum creatinine levels, proteinuria, enzymuria, cylindruria, and glycosuria, among other signs.

Moreover, the risk of nephrotoxicity and renal dysfunction associated with ifosfamide is corroborated by post-marketing experiences, which have resulted in documented fatal outcomes from acute and chronic renal failure. Additionally, Section 6.2 ""Postmarketing Experience"" mentions renal structural damage that could manifest as acute tubular necrosis, reinforcing the drug's potential to induce AKI.

It is essential to note that the risk of renal toxicity with ifosfamide is dose-dependent. Section 5.3 of the label advises careful weighing of the risk and expected benefits of ifosfamide therapy in patients with preexisting renal impairment or reduced nephron reserve. Measures such as monitoring serum and urine chemistries, including renal function tests (such as creatinine and urea nitrogen levels), prior, during, and after treatment are recommended to detect and manage potential AKI. The document also emphasizes the importance of monitoring urinary sediment for signs of nephrotoxicity.

No other specific incidence rate from controlled trials was provided for AKI, but the label warns healthcare professionals that nephrotoxicity can lead to renal failure and potentially death, which underscores the gravity of the adverse effect.

In summary, the relation between AKI and ifosfamide exposure is well-documented in the drug labeling, which includes clinical trial data and post-marketing reports. This relationship is supported by clear evidence of nephrotoxic effects, including detailed descriptions of how renal injury may occur with ifosfamide therapy. These adverse reactions can range from mild kidney dysfunction to severe renal failure and, in some instances, have resulted in patient deaths.",NA
acute kidney injury,iloperidone,,"The provided sections of the drug label for iloperidone do not specifically mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction. The adverse reactions commonly observed in the clinical trials and noted with an incidence of ≥5% and at least twice that of the placebo include dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal congestion, orthostatic hypotension, somnolence, tachycardia, and increased weight. Additionally, through a comprehensive search of the clinical trial database for iloperidone, which included 2,070 patients exposed to iloperidone at doses of at least 10 mg/day, there is no mention of acute kidney injury.

Furthermore, post-marketing surveillance for adverse reactions identified instances of retrograde ejaculation and hypersensitivity reactions, but no mention of acute kidney injury is made in this section either.

Based on the evidence from the drug label, which traditionally includes safety data from clinical trials, post-market surveillance, and other scientific literature available to the drug manufacturer and regulatory agencies, there is no known evidence supporting a direct relationship between iloperidone and acute kidney injury. It is important to note that while this specific document does not report AKI, it does not preclude the possibility of such events being reported elsewhere in medical literature or recognized after the knowledge cutoff date for this assessment. Therefore, it is recommended to consult the most current medical literature and pharmacovigilance data for any updates on the assessment of adverse drug reactions related to iloperidone.",NA
acute kidney injury,iloperidone,,"Based on the provided label sections for the drug FANAPT (iloperidone), there is no direct evidence listed that associates iloperidone with acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) focuses on commonly observed side effects, such as dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal congestion, orthostatic hypotension, somnolence, tachycardia, and increased weight. Additionally, the label includes extensive detail on clinical trial experiences, other reactions observed during pre-marketing, and postmarketing experiences, but acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned in these sections.

Notably, under ""Renal and Urinary Disorders,"" the section mentions urinary incontinence as a frequent adverse event and other urinary issues like dysuria, pollakiuria, enuresis, and nephrolithiasis as infrequent. There is also a mention of ""renal failure acute"" as a rare event. However, the incidence of acute kidney injury specifically due to iloperidone use is not detailed, suggesting that if such an event occurred, it was either not common or not conclusively linked to the medication during clinical trials or the post-marketing phase.

Given the absence of a clear mention of AKI as an adverse drug reaction linked to iloperidone, it can be inferred that either there is no known evidence of such a relationship or the evidence is insufficient to warrant inclusion in the labeling at the time of the provided information. However, it's important for healthcare providers to remain vigilant for new safety data emerging from post-marketing surveillance and further studies. If a patient on iloperidone exhibits signs of renal impairment, the situation should be investigated to determine if the drug could be a contributing factor.

In conclusion, there is no known evidence specified in the provided drug label to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to iloperidone. Any observations or reports of such adverse reactions should be reported to Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. or the FDA as indicated on the label.",NA
acute kidney injury,iloprost,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for iloprost (brand name VENTAVIS), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The label does, however, note kidney failure as a serious adverse event reported pre-marketing that is not shown in the provided table (Table 1) of side effects from the 12-week placebo-controlled study.

The primary listed adverse reactions from the clinical trials with a placebo comparison did not include acute kidney injury. The most common adverse reactions mentioned were vasodilation, increased cough, headache, trismus, insomnia, nausea, hypotension, vomiting, increased alkaline phosphatase, flu syndrome, back pain, tongue pain, palpitations, syncope, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), muscle cramps, hemoptysis, and pneumonia.

Additionally, post-marketing experiences, which can often reveal more rare side effects, mention bronchospasm and wheezing, particularly in patients with a history of hyperreactive airways, along with epistaxis and hemoptysis as bleeding events, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, diarrhea, irritation of the mouth and tongue, nasal congestion, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, and rash. However, acute kidney injury is not specified among these post-marketing adverse reactions.

In summary, while kidney failure is mentioned as a pre-marketing serious adverse event, the evidence for a direct relationship between iloprost exposure and acute kidney injury specifically is not detailed in the provided labelling information. To establish such a relationship definitively, further examination of trial data, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance that specifically addresses the incidence and causality of acute kidney injury in relation to iloprost use would be required. If such detailed evidence becomes available, it would then be necessary to assess it in the context of the known safety profile of iloprost.",NA
acute kidney injury,imatinib,,"The provided drug label sections contain extensive information on adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions related to the use of imatinib (marketed as Gleevec in the US), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). However, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction within these sections.

To precisely address the query regarding evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and imatinib exposure, it is necessary to look beyond the provided label sections. A detailed search of the literature, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, would be needed to find specific reports or studies on this potential adverse reaction.

Based on the data provided:
- Renal toxicity is mentioned in the Warnings and Precautions (section 5.14) as a potential risk associated with imatinib, with a recommendation to evaluate renal function prior to and during therapy.
- AKI itself is not listed in either the Adverse Reactions or Warnings and Precautions sections. 
- ""Renal Toxicity"" is specifically noted under Warnings and Precautions (5.14), stating that renal function decline can occur with imatinib use and recommending monitoring of renal function during treatment.

Without specific evidence within the provided label sections stating that AKI is a known adverse reaction of imatinib, it would be inappropriate to confirm such a relationship. Additional research would be required to establish this connection.

For a precise and evidence-based summary of the relationship between AKI and imatinib, one should consult peer-reviewed studies, case reports involving AKI in patients taking imatinib, and analysis of post-marketing surveillance data. If such data were to be provided or available, a more detailed summary could be presented. In the absence of such evidence, it cannot be definitively stated that there is a known causal relationship between imatinib use and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,indinavir,,"Based on the provided drug label sections pertaining to indinavir (marketed as CRIXIVAN), there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and indinavir use. Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV infection.

Clinical Trials:
- Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis (kidney stones), which could lead to AKI, was reported in approximately 12.4% of patients receiving indinavir at recommended doses in clinical trials.
- The frequency of kidney stones increased with the duration of indinavir exposure.
- 2.8% of patients who developed nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis experienced hydronephrosis, which is a concerning condition that can lead to AKI if not promptly treated.
- 4.5% of patients underwent stent placement, a procedure often required to relieve obstruction caused by stones.
- 4.9% of patients discontinued therapy due to acute episodes of nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- In the post-marketing experience section, there is mention of nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis leading to renal insufficiency or acute renal failure, a severe form of AKI.
- There are also reports of interstitial nephritis, a condition that can lead to AKI. Some patients did not resolve even after discontinuing indinavir, suggesting a potential direct toxic effect on renal tubules.
- Additional reports include instances of pyelonephritis with or without bacteremia, renal insufficiency, and renal failure, all indicating possible adverse renal effects related to indinavir usage.

Laboratory Abnormalities:
- Although not directly indicative of AKI, the laboratory abnormalities section does not report increased serum creatinine, which would be seen with AKI.

The above findings from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicate that indinavir can lead to adverse renal events, including AKI. Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis) are a well-documented side effect of indinavir that predisposes patients to AKI. There are also reports of renal impairment and failure, which are classic presentations of AKI, in the post-marketing surveillance data.

The evidence from the drug label highlights that AKI is a potential adverse reaction of indinavir. Patients on indinavir should be monitored closely for signs of renal impairment, and hydration status should be maintained to prevent the formation of renal stones, which are a known risk factor for AKI in the context of indinavir therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,indomethacin,,"The drug label for indomethacin provides a comprehensive list of potential adverse reactions associated with its use, as is common with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Among the listed potential reactions is renal toxicity, which includes a range of renal-related issues such as renal impairment and renal failure.

Section 5.6 of the drug label specifically warns about ""Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia."" It states that long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Furthermore, renal toxicity has been seen in patients for whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in maintaining renal perfusion. Such patients may experience a reduction in renal blood flow, potentially leading to overt renal decompensation, when given NSAIDs like indomethacin.

The label advises extreme caution and monitoring of renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia, and states that the use of indomethacin in patients with advanced renal disease should be avoided unless the expected benefits outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. Additionally, the label recommends that indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered concurrently due to the risk of acute renal failure.

While the label does not use the term ""acute kidney injury"" (AKI) specifically, the description of renal toxicity can encompass AKI. AKI is characterized by a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days. AKI causes waste products to build up in the blood and makes it hard for kidneys to maintain the correct balance of fluids in the body.

The adverse reactions and warnings presented in this label are based on evidence accumulated from clinical experience, post-marketing surveillance, and literature reports. Although the drug label may not always provide detailed clinical trial data for each specific adverse reaction, the inclusion of renal toxicity in the label indicates that evidence exists of a relationship between indomethacin exposure and potential adverse renal reactions, including acute kidney injury.

Should more precise and quantified evidence be required, a review of pharmacovigilance databases, additional clinical trial data, and published case reports or cohort studies should be undertaken. These sources would provide greater detail on the frequency, severity, and specific characteristics of acute kidney injury associated with indomethacin use.",NA
acute kidney injury,ipilimumab,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known potential adverse reaction related to ipilimumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor used in cancer therapy. Evidence supporting AKI as an adverse reaction of ipilimumab comes from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Here is a summary based on the provided drug label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   Acute kidney injury was reported in the CHECKMATE-214 clinical trial evaluating YERVOY (ipilimumab) in combination with nivolumab for advanced renal cell carcinoma. The trial identified serious adverse reactions including acute kidney injury in patients treated with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab, with a severity grade requiring medical intervention.

2. Post-Marketing Experience:
   Post-marketing surveillance has also identified cases of acute kidney injury in patients receiving YERVOY. While precise incidence rates are not provided, the drug label explicitly states AKI as an adverse reaction identified during post-approval use.

It is important to note that immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to various immune-mediated adverse reactions across organ systems due to their mechanism of action. Ipilimumab-related AKI is likely immune-mediated, and thus consistent with its pharmacodynamic properties. Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for signs of kidney injury during and after treatment with YERVOY.

In conclusion, the relationship between ipilimumab exposure and acute kidney injury is supported by evidence gathered from clinical studies, such as CHECKMATE-214, and reinforced by reports collected through post-marketing surveillance. Both sources indicate that while this adverse reaction is not listed among the most common, it is a recognized risk associated with ipilimumab therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,ipilimumab,,"Summary of Evidence:

The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and ipilimumab exposure, which is reflected in the product label, comes from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance data.

1. Clinical Trials: In the CHECKMATE studies, there were reported cases of immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, which serve as the basis for associating AKI with ipilimumab exposure.
   - CHECKMATE-214 and CHECKMATE-142 (YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab 3 mg/kg): Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction were reported in 4.1% (27/666) of patients, with Grade 3-4 events in 1.2% (8/666). Among these patients, 1.2% experienced permanent discontinuation, and 1.8% had treatment withheld due to AKI.
   - CHECKMATE-9LA (YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy: Information regarding renal dysfunction is included in the post-marketing experience section, indicating cases might have been reported after the approval of the drug.
   
2. Case Studies: While specific individual case studies are not mentioned in the provided label sections, they may have contributed to the understanding of ipilimumab-associated AKI in the scientific community and provided further insights into the manifestation of this adverse reaction.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   - The label mentions cases of fatal or serious immune-mediated nephritis resulting in AKI, reported through post-marketing surveillance, which underscores the continued risk assessment after a drug has been approved and released on the market.

Overall, while the product label documents immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction as adverse events of ipilimumab, there is a mention of AKI in the context of post-marketing experience without specific incidence rates. The evidence for AKI as a potential adverse reaction of ipilimumab is thus recognized in the context of broader renal adverse effects and derives from aggregate clinical trial data, with additional support from post-marketing reports. It is important to note that cancer patients may have multiple risk factors for renal injury, and immunotherapy can exacerbate these risks through immune-mediated processes. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for symptoms of AKI and manage patients according to clinical guidelines which include the monitoring of renal function and the use of corticosteroids in the management of severe immune-mediated adverse reactions.",NA
acute kidney injury,irbesartan,,"The provided drug label sections for irbesartan do refer to renal-related adverse reactions and warnings, which can be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Here is a summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and irbesartan exposure from clinical trials and postmarketing experience, followed by a summary of relevant warnings:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
- In the clinical trials section (6.1), while AKI is not specifically listed as an adverse reaction, there is mention of impaired renal function being a concern in the warnings and precautions section (5.3). 
- The drug has been evaluated in patients with hypertension as well as in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), while hyperkalemia was a significant issue (with higher rates in irbesartan users), there is no explicit mention of AKI.
- Orthostatic symptoms were more frequently observed in the treatment group, but this does not directly suggest AKI. 

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- The postmarketing experience (6.2) does not explicitly list AKI among the adverse reactions reported. It mentions hyperkalemia, which could be a surrogate marker for kidney dysfunction but is not synonymous with AKI.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- The warnings and precautions sections (5.2 and 5.3) suggest a potential for AKI in certain populations. It specifically states that ""Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system.""
- Irbesartan is noted to pose a risk for renal function impairment in patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or volume depletion).

In conclusion, while acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as a documented adverse reaction from clinical trials or postmarketing data provided, there are warnings within the drug's labeling that acknowledge the potential for drugs like irbesartan, which act on the renin-angiotensin system, to cause changes in renal function, including acute renal failure. It should be noted that pharmacovigilance data often solely relies on healthcare professionals and patients reporting adverse events, and underreporting is a known limitation.

For a definitive assessment of the risk of AKI with irbesartan, more specific reviews, research, or case studies detailing instances of AKI following irbesartan use would be necessary. The summary is based on the provided sections of the drug label, and more detailed information may be available in the complete prescribing information or through a review of the medical literature.",NA
acute kidney injury,irinotecan,,"The provided drug label for ONIVYDE (irinotecan liposome injection) includes substantial information about various adverse reactions observed during clinical trials and post-marketing experience but does not list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction specifically associated with irinotecan. The label discusses several adverse effects, such as neutropenia, diarrhea, interstitial lung disease, and hypersensitivity reactions, with detailed statistics on their incidence and severity in clinical trial subjects.

Specifically, within the NAPOLI-3 and NAPOLI-1 studies, severe adverse reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and situations that could lead to dose modification or therapy discontinuation are elaborated upon. Nonetheless, while AKI is frequently mentioned in adverse reactions, especially considering that it's a common concern with cancer chemotherapeutics, the absence of AKI in the adverse reaction sections of ONIVYDE's label suggests that, as of now, there may not be substantial, direct evidence linking irinotecan (ONIVYDE formulation) to AKI.

The section for postmarketing experience, which could potentially capture AKI if it were an unrecognized adverse reaction during clinical trials, also does not mention AKY. It is possible that AKI has not been reported or has not been frequently enough associated with ONIVYDE to warrant inclusion in the label.

In summary, based on the label provided, which encompasses clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, there is no explicit evidence that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction of irinotecan, specifically the formulation used in ONIVYDE. It is important to consider, however, that medical knowledge is continually evolving, and new evidence could emerge in the future that better characterizes the relationship between irinotecan and renal function. Healthcare professionals typically conduct ongoing surveillance for such safety signals, particularly in post-marketing settings where broader patient populations and long-term use may reveal additional adverse effects not captured in clinical trials.",NA
acute kidney injury,isavuconazonium,,"Based on the provided drug label information for isavuconazonium (brand name CRESEMBA), acute kidney injury has been identified as a potential adverse reaction during the clinical trials of the drug. Here is the evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and isavuconazonium exposure:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   In the clinical trial data presented for adult patients, ""renal failure"" is listed among the adverse reactions. In Trial 1, this adverse reaction occurred in 26 out of 257 patients (10.1%) treated with CRESEMBA. Although ""renal failure"" includes a broad spectrum of renal impairments, acute kidney injury can be part of this categorization. The active-controlled clinical trial compared the incidence of adverse reactions with CRESEMBA to voriconazole treatment, with similar adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   The drug label does not list acute kidney injury or similar terms directly under the post-marketing experience section. However, this section of the drug label lists spontaneously reported adverse reactions without a reliable estimate of frequency and is typically inclusive of acute kidney injury if observed. Thus, no specific post-marketing evidence for acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to isavuconazonium is provided in the label.

3. Specific Case Studies:
   The drug label information provided does not include any specific case studies detailing incidents of acute kidney injury related to isavuconazonium exposure. Therefore, we do not have evidence from case studies to summarize.

In summary, the relationship between acute kidney injury and isavuconazonium is supported by evidence from clinical trials where ""renal failure"" was reported as an adverse reaction. It is important to interpret these findings within the context of patient populations who are often immunocompromised and have underlying conditions that may also contribute to renal complications. 

The detailed clinical trial results and specific information on renal adverse reactions are paramount for healthcare professionals when assessing the risk-benefit profile for patients prescribed with isavuconazonium. As always, healthcare providers should monitor for signs of renal impairment during therapy with isavuconazonium and manage as appropriate.",NA
acute kidney injury,isoflurane,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction and isoflurane exposure comes from post-marketing surveillance, as indicated in the provided drug label excerpt.

Post-Marketing Adverse Reactions:
The drug label notes that ""cases of acute renal failure and oliguria have been reported after isoflurane anesthesia. These events may be secondary to hypotension or other effects of isoflurane."" It is important to highlight that these observations come from the post-marketing experience, where the adverse reactions are voluntarily reported, and therefore, it may be challenging to establish the frequency and a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

The provided sections do not specify evidence from controlled clinical trials directly linking isoflurane to acute kidney injury. Although AKI is listed under ""RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS"" in the post-marketing adverse reactions, this section specifies that a causal relationship cannot always be reliably estimated due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the uncertain size of the exposed population.

Thus, while there have been reports suggesting a possible association between isoflurane exposure and AKI, the evidence is limited to post-marketing reports, and no direct causation or incidence rates can be provided with certainty. Clinical trials and case studies have not been cited in the provided label information regarding this specific adverse reaction. Further investigation, including well-controlled studies, could help to elucidate the strength and nature of this association. 

Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for signs of AKI in patients exposed to isoflurane, considering patient-specific factors and overall clinical context.",NA
acute kidney injury,itraconazole,,"The evidence available in the itraconazole drug label does not explicitly associate acute kidney injury with itraconazole use based on the provided sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings). The label details various adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing experience but does not list acute kidney injury as a known adverse effect of the drug.

In the clinical trials section, adverse events reported in the treatment of systemic fungal infections and onychomycosis clinical trials principally focus on gastrointestinal disorders, liver enzyme abnormalities, skin reactions, and other systemic effects. A spectrum of hepatic disorders, including serious hepatotoxicity, has been noted.

The post-marketing experience table includes ""renal impairment"" under renal and urinary disorders, which might encompass a range of kidney-related adverse effects. However, the specific term ""acute kidney injury"" was not mentioned, and the details regarding the exact nature and severity of the renal impairment are not provided.

Furthermore, the boxed warning includes information about congestive heart failure and cardiac effects, indicating a focus on cardiovascular risks rather than renal risks associated with itraconazole use.

Based on the information provided and the context of the drug label excerpts, there is no direct or documented evidence in the cited sections to suggest that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction to itraconazole. Without additional data from larger studies, case reports, or comprehensive clinical analysis, it is not possible to establish a clear link between itraconazole exposure and acute kidney injury. If more detailed sections of the label or other research publications were available, they might potentially provide further insights.",NA
acute kidney injury,ixabepilone,,"The available evidence from the provided drug label sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) for ixabepilone does not specifically list acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction or as a concern in the warnings and precautions.

The clinical trial data (Studies 046 and 081) and the reported adverse reactions in both the clinical trial experience section and postmarketing experience do not mention acute kidney injury directly. The most common adverse reactions mentioned are peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue/asthenia, myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain. Hematologic laboratory abnormalities mentioned include neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The serious adverse reactions section lists several system-specific adverse reactions, including renal and urinary disorders such as nephrolithiasis and renal failure, but it does not detail the incidence of acute kidney injury in relation to ixabepilone exposure.

In summary, based on the provided label information, there is no explicit evidence suggesting a direct relationship between acute kidney injury and ixabepilone exposure from the sources given. However, renal failure is mentioned as one of the serious adverse reactions in clinical trials, although with no specifics provided. It is important to consider that postmarketing experience can sometimes reveal adverse reactions not identified during clinical trials, but no explicit link to acute kidney injury has been established in this context for ixabepilone. If further evidence or data outside of the provided sections exist, they were not included in the summary for evaluation.",NA
acute kidney injury,ketoprofen,1.0,"Summary of Evidence:

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Ketoprofen Exposure:

Evidence from Adverse Reactions Section of the Label:
- The label for ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), lists ""impairment of renal function"" as an adverse event with an incidence greater than 1%, indicating a probable causal relationship.
- Specific renal-related adverse reactions listed under this section with probable causal relationships include edema and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which can be indicators of compromised kidney function.
- Other renal adverse effects with an incidence less than 1% but still noted as having a probable causal relationship include renal failure and interstitial nephritis.

Evidence from Postmarketing Surveillance:
- Postmarketing reports often include voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and consumers, which can be a source of identifying rare adverse reactions not captured in clinical trials.
- The label advises reporting suspected adverse reactions to the FDA, which is instrumental in the ongoing surveillance of drug safety post-marketing. However, the summary does not specifically mention any postmarketing data on acute kidney injury.

Clinical Trials and Case Studies:
- While the provided sections of the label do not detail specific clinical trials or case studies related to acute kidney injury, clinical trials are part of the initial safety profile assessment before market authorization. 
- The label mentions controlled clinical trials and U.S. clinical trials but does not provide detailed accounts of cases specifically associated with acute kidney injury.

Other Considerations:
- The label underlines that NSAIDs, including ketoprofen, carry risks for serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events. These warnings are pertinent because they contextualize the broader scope of potential risks associated with NSAID use.
- It is noteworthy to mention that NSAID-associated renal impairment is a recognized phenomenon, as NSAIDs can affect renal prostaglandins which play a role in maintaining renal blood flow, especially in patients with existing renal impairment or in certain clinical situations leading to renal hypoperfusion.

Conclusion:
The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to ketoprofen includes listed renal impairment adverse reactions with greater than 1% incidence, noted cases of renal failure and interstitial nephritis, and the inherent risks NSAIDs pose to renal function as understood in medical literature. While specific incidences from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data are not detailed in the provided sections of the label, the listed adverse reactions and known NSAID pharmacodynamics strongly suggest a link between ketoprofen use and acute kidney injury. Health care professionals should remain vigilant for signs of renal dysfunction in patients taking ketoprofen, particularly in those with risk factors for renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,ketorolac,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to ketorolac can be derived from various sections of the drug label provided, including adverse reactions, warnings, boxed warnings, and post-marketing surveillance data.

**Clinical Trials and Drug Label Warnings:**
1. Under ""Adverse Reactions,"" the drug label explicitly mentions ""abnormal renal function"" and ""acute renal failure"" as reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients taking ketorolac in clinical trials, indicating that these renal issues are among the more common adverse effects of the drug. 

2. In the ""Warnings"" section, it is emphasized that ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment and in those at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. This highlights a known relationship between ketorolac use and renal risk, which encompasses acute kidney injury.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The drug label also refers to adverse reactions reported from postmarketing experience, which include ""renal failure"" and adverse renal conditions such as ""flank pain with or without hematuria and/or azotemia."" This suggests that observations of renal adverse effects have persisted beyond the context of clinical trials, in the broader patient population.

**Boxed Warnings:**
While the boxed warnings primarily focus on gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and bleeding risks, the integration of renal risk in the context of these warnings and the clear contraindications for certain patients suggest an established recognition of the renal risks, including acute kidney injury, associated with ketorolac.

In conclusion, evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and ketorolac exposure includes reports from clinical trials, as noted in the drug label's adverse reactions, and reinforced by warnings and contraindications for use in patients with renal risk factors. Additionally, post-marketing surveillance data further corroborate this relationship. The labeling of the drug by regulatory authorities reflects this known risk, emphasizing the need for caution in prescribing and monitoring of patients who are administered ketorolac.","NA

The drug label itself lists acute renal failure as a possible severe complication of treatment with ketorolac tromethamine. It specifically states ""abnormal renal function"" and ""renal failure"" as potential adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, and it is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and ketorolac exposure, as the adverse reaction is recognized by the drug's labeling information."
acute kidney injury,lamivudine,,"The provided drug label information does not indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a reported adverse reaction associated with lamivudine, either in the setting of clinical trials or post-marketing experience. Lamividine is an antiretroviral medication used primarily in the treatment of HIV infection, and its common adverse reactions listed in the drug label include headache, nausea, malaise and fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough in adults, as well as fever and cough in pediatric subjects.

Specifically looking at section 6.1 related to clinical trials experience, no mention is made of AKI or any related kidney issues in adult subjects. Similarly, for pediatric subjects, while there are some abdominal and gastrointestinal side effects reported, there is no mention of kidney-related adverse signs. The laboratory abnormalities table (Table 4) does not include kidney function tests like creatinine or glomerular filtration rate, which would indicate issues related to AKI.

Moreover, in the section on postmarketing experience (6.2), AKI is also not listed as an adverse reaction to lamivudine. The narrative mainly points out other systemic and localized reactions without reference to kidney injury or impairment.

Given the lack of evidence suggesting AKI as an identified adverse reaction associated with lamivudine in both the clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance provided in the drug label, it can be explicitly stated that, based on the current available labeling information, there is no known association between lamivudine use and the development of acute kidney injury. If concern for AKI arises in the context of lamivudine use, it is possible that this represents an unreported or rare event, or that kidney injury may be due to other factors such as concomitant medications or underlying health conditions rather than direct drug toxicity.

For any updates beyond this label or to explore hypothetical or suspected cases of AKI related to lamivudine, one would have to look at the most current medical literature, case reports, pharmacovigilance databases, or clinical study reports that might not be reflected in this label.",NA
acute kidney injury,lamotrigine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for lamotrigine, there is no mention of acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction associated with its use in the treatment of epilepsy or bipolar disorder in the provided clinical trial data or postmarketing surveillance summaries. The most common adverse reactions in adults are related to neurological symptoms (e.g., dizziness, headache, diplopia), gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting), and skin reactions (e.g., rash). Serious adverse reactions are described more fully in the Warnings and Precautions section and include serious skin rashes, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, and organ failure among others; however, acute kidney injury is not specifically listed there either. 

In the postmarketing experience section, there is a mention of ""acute kidney failure"" and ""kidney failure"" among the rare urogenital adverse reactions, but these terms generally refer to sudden and severe loss of kidney function rather than a specific mention of acute kidney injury directly attributed to lamotrigine. However, isolated reports of ""Tubulointerstitial nephritis (reported alone and in association with uveitis)"" are cited in the postmarketing section, which can be associated with acute kidney injury.

Therefore, while the provided label information suggests that kidney-related issues including acute kidney failure have been observed in rare cases, these reports are not necessarily indicative of a causal relationship and are not frequent or consistent enough to establish acute kidney injury as a recognized adverse reaction to lamotrigine. To conclude, there appears to be limited evidence from rare postmarketing reports that lamotrigine can cause acute kidney injury, but this reaction is not well-established as a common or significant adverse reaction in the clinical trial data for the drug. As with any drug-related adverse events, healthcare providers should report observed occurrences so that an accurate risk can be established over time through continued surveillance.","NA

The label information provided does not mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to lamotrigine. Therefore, based on this data, there is no direct evidence linking the drug exposure of lamotrigine to acute kidney injury. However, this does not categorically refute the relationship, as not all possible side effects may be captured in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance, and individual cases or newer research might provide additional insights that are not reflected in the current label information. If further evaluation or updated data are required, clinical studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data should be reviewed when available."
acute kidney injury,lansoprazole,,"Acute kidney injury, specifically acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), is an adverse reaction associated with the use of lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. The relevant sections of the drug label provided detail this connection as follows:

In Section 5.2 (Warnings and Precautions) of the drug label, it specifically warns about acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. It indicates that acute TIN has been observed in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including lansoprazole, and can occur at any point during PPI therapy. The section advises that patients presenting with varying signs and symptoms from hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function, such as malaise, nausea, and anorexia, should discontinue lansoprazole and undergo evaluation for acute TIN.

Section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) of the drug label mentions additional adverse experiences reported since the marketing of lansoprazole, noting that among the events listed by the body system in the Urogenital System, interstitial nephritis occurs. However, it is also specified that the majority of these cases are foreign-sourced, and a direct relationship to lansoprazole has not been established due to voluntary reporting from an unknown population size.

The summary of clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance in sections 6.1 and 6.2 indicates that there were no specific studies cited that clearly demonstrate the incidence rate of TIN among patients taking lansoprazole, as rates of this particular adverse event beyond the clinical trial period are not detailed. However, the inclusion of TIN in the Warnings and Precautions as well as Postmarketing Experience sections of the drug label implies recognition of a relationship between lansoprazole use and the development of acute kidney injury.

It is important to note that these label warnings are based on observations and reported cases, which suggest an association, but they do not necessarily confirm causality in every instance. Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of kidney injury during lansoprazole therapy and act accordingly if such symptoms arise.",NA
acute kidney injury,lenalidomide,,"The available drug label for lenalidomide, as provided in the provided text, does not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a known adverse reaction to the medication. The label does discuss other serious adverse reactions and side effects, including hematologic toxicity (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), venous and arterial thromboembolism, increased mortality in certain populations, hepatotoxicity, severe cutaneous reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, and others. Nevertheless, renal failure including acute cases is mentioned among the adverse reactions for patients with multiple myeloma under the section ""Renal and Urinary disorders"" with a reported incidence of 9% in the Rd Continuous group and 10% in the Rd18 group (Table 4).

Regarding direct evidence from the drug label about the relationship between lenalidomide and AKI:

1. Clinical Trial Experience:
   - Under section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, renal failure, including acute cases, is listed as an adverse reaction observed in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) receiving lenalidomide in combination therapy, with an incidence of 9% in the Rd Continuous cohort and 10% in the Rd18 cohort.
   - Adverse events specific to renal function are further detailed in Table 4 of the provided label, where ""Renal failure (including acute)"" is reported.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience does not specifically mention acute kidney injury, but it does mention the broader category of renal and urinary disorders without providing detailed incidence rates.

Considering the information provided, while explicit discussion of AKI as a general known adverse effect is not found in the boxed warnings or other warning sections, evidence from the clinical trials does indicate that renal failure, including acute cases, has been observed as an adverse reaction in patients treated with lenalidomide.

Clinical decisions regarding lenalidomide should take into account all possible side effects, including the risk of AKI, and should be based on a thorough consideration of the patient's health status, existing comorbidities, and the overall balance of potential benefits and risks. Regular monitoring of renal function may be warranted for patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly those with risk factors for renal impairment.",NA
acute kidney injury,levetiracetam,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to levetiracetam is not listed in the provided sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) of the drug label. The adverse reactions discussed include behavioral abnormalities, somnolence, fatigue, anaphylaxis, angioedema, serious dermatological reactions, coordination difficulties, hematologic abnormalities, and increased blood pressure, among others. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials experience, nor is it listed under the post-marketing experience section (6.2 Postmarketing Experience).

The details listed under postmarketing experience indicate that acute kidney injury has been identified during the postapproval use of levetiracetam. However, because post-marketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, it is difficult to establish a frequency or a clear causal relationship to drug exposure. Therefore, while there have been reports of AKI, the evidence does not allow for a definite conclusion about the strength of the relationship between AKI and levetiracetam exposure.

In conclusion, while there are some reports of AKI as an adverse reaction in the post-marketing surveillance of levetiracetam, the available information does not provide a clear or consistent indication that AKI is a common or well-characterized adverse effect associated with the drug based on the evidence presented in the provided sections of the labeling. Health care providers should remain vigilant for this potential adverse reaction, especially since it has been voluntarily reported, but further study would be required to establish a definitive causal relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,levocarnitine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience regarding levocarnitine, there is documented evidence of kidney-related adverse events. The label specifically mentions ""kidney failure"" with a frequency of 6 incidents each for the placebo group and various dosages of levocarnitine (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and combined dosages) in clinical trials involving patients on chronic hemodialysis. These events were reported without regard to causality, meaning it was not definitively stated whether levocarnitine caused the kidney failure.

The label does not explicitly list ""acute kidney injury"" (AKI) as an adverse reaction, but ""kidney failure"" could encompass AKI depending on the clinical context and definitions used. However, the absence of specific attribution to levocarnitine suggests that while kidney-related issues have been noted during clinical trials, additional investigation may be necessary to establish a direct causal link between levocarnitine and AKI specifically.

Furthermore, the post-marketing experience does not detail instances of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to levocarnitine. The post-marketing reports focus on neurologic reactions such as seizures and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema, and bronchospasm.

In conclusion, while there is documentation of kidney failure incidents in clinical trials involving levocarnitine, the evidence does not explicitly state acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction attributable to levocarnitine use. Without further data directly linking levocarnitine to acute kidney injury, particularly from sources such as well-designed clinical trials, case studies, or robust post-marketing analyses that investigate causality, it's not possible to conclusively state that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction of levocarnitine.","NA

The provided drug label sections for levocarnitine do not specifically mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. Furthermore, the label lists ""kidney failure"" under adverse events occurring at ≥ 5% regardless of causality, which implies that some renal-related events were noted. However, ""kidney failure"" in this context does not equate directly to AKI, as AKI refers to a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or days and is potentially reversible, while chronic kidney failure may be a more gradual and irreversible condition.

It is essential to note that while AKI is not explicitly stated as an adverse reaction, the absence of it in the label does not necessarily refute a potential relationship; it may indicate that AKI was not observed or reported in the clinical trials or post-marketing data available at the time of the label's publication. For a definitive refutation, targeted pharmacovigilance studies or larger clinical trials examining renal function in patients treated with levocarnitine would be necessary.


If there have been specific subsequent studies or data collected that directly investigate and refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and levocarnitine, that information is not provided within the drug label sections shared above. Therefore, without additional evidence sources, the statement stands as ""NA"" based on the provided information."
acute kidney injury,levofloxacin,,"Based on the provided levofloxacin drug label sections, acute kidney injury is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to the drug under post-marketing surveillance, but it is not among the most common reactions observed in clinical trials.

Clinical Trials:
The clinical trial data described in the label details adverse reactions in patients who received levofloxacin, among which the most common (≥3%) were nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness. It is specified that 4.3% of patients discontinued use due to adverse reactions, and detailed tables of common and less common reactions are provided. However, these tables and the summarized patient experiences do not list acute kidney injury as a frequent adverse event observed during the clinical trials involving a total of 7,537 patients.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Acute kidney injury is mentioned in the section detailing post-marketing experience, which compiles adverse events reported after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use. The section ""Renal and Urinary Disorders"" lists ""interstitial nephritis"" and ""acute renal failure"" among other postmarketing adverse reaction reports. These terms encompass a range of kidney injuries, including acute kidney injury.

Warnings and Precautions:
In the section on ""Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions,"" acute renal insufficiency or failure is noted among the spectrum of severe reactions occurring after administration of multiple doses. While not specific to acute kidney injury, it implies that serious kidney-related events have been observed.

Overall, the evidence linking acute kidney injury to levofloxacin is primarily derived from post-marketing reports rather than controlled clinical trials. This suggests that such side effects may be relatively rare, less frequently detected in the clinical trial setting, or inadequately captured by the data from clinical trials. Nonetheless, these post-marketing findings are taken seriously and are reflected in the drug’s labeling as part of the known spectrum of potential adverse reactions. It is important for healthcare providers to consider this information when prescribing levofloxacin and to monitor renal function as appropriate.",NA
acute kidney injury,levoleucovorin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for levoleucovorin, there is no direct evidence presented indicating that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction of levoleucovorin in the context of either high-dose methotrexate therapy or combination with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer.

In the summary of the clinical trials experience (section 6.1), renal function abnormalities are mentioned only once with no specification of acute kidney injury or details regarding its frequency or severity. This adverse reaction appears under high-dose methotrexate therapy where levoleucovorin is used for rescue, suggesting the abnormal renal function could potentially be related to methotrexate toxicity, the treatment of which is one of the uses of levoleucovorin. It is important to note that methotrexate is well-known for its nephrotoxic effects, which can lead to various degrees of renal impairment, including acute kidney injury.

The adverse reactions listed under postmarketing experience (section 6.2) also do not include acute kidney injury, though it is acknowledged that this list may not be exhaustive and that postmarketing surveillance can sometimes miss less common or delayed adverse reactions due to its voluntary reporting nature.

The warnings and precautions sections (5) discuss hypercalcemia (5.1), gastrointestinal toxicities with fluorouracil (5.2), and a drug interaction with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (5.3), but there is no mention of renal-related adverse effects or acute kidney injury related directly to levoleucovorin itself.

In conclusion, based on the provided information from the drug label, there does not appear to be a clear link or substantial evidence directly associating acute kidney injury with levoleucovorin exposure as an adverse reaction. To definitely establish such a relationship, additional data, such as controlled clinical trial information specifically examining renal outcomes or robust post-marketing surveillance data that isolates levoleucovorin's effects from those of concomitant medications, would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,levorphanol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label of levorphanol tartrate tablets, there is a report of ""kidney failure"" listed under the section for adverse events, which can be interpreted as a severe form of acute kidney injury (AKI). This is indicative of past observational findings during clinical treatment with levorphanol. However, it should be noted that the term ""kidney failure"" encompasses a range of renal impairments, including AKI.

Additionally, under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section, kidney failure is again listed as an adverse reaction that has been identified during the post-approval use of levorphanol. It is important to recognize that postmarketing reports are based on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, which often renders it difficult to reliably estimate the frequency of an adverse event or to firmly establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The available evidence from the drug label indicates that acute kidney injury has been reported as an adverse event in patients treated with levorphanol tartrate. However, detailed information such as the incidence rate, the context of the adverse reaction (e.g., dosing, patient characteristics, concomitant medications), and a clear causal relationship have not been provided. Further investigation, such as reviewing the published literature or databases for case studies or clinical trials specifically assessing renal outcomes with levorphanol use, would be required to provide a more comprehensive summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between AKI and levorphanol exposure.

In the absence of more detailed clinical data or robust statistical analyses from postmarketing surveillance, it remains challenging to conclude definitively that there is a causal link between AKI and levorphanol. Health care providers should be aware of this potential adverse event and monitor renal function as appropriate when prescribing levorphanol, considering the existing evidence.","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label for levorphanol, there is no mention of refuting evidence against the relationship between acute kidney injury and the drug exposure. In fact, the label lists ""kidney failure"" as one of the reported adverse events with the use of levorphanol tartrate tablets. Therefore, acute kidney injury is recognized as a potential adverse reaction of levorphanol, and no evidence refuting this relationship is presented in the labeled information."
acute kidney injury,lincomycin,,"The drug label provided for lincomycin includes a range of adverse reactions that have been associated with its use. Among these reactions, renal and urinary disorders are listed, specifically mentioning ""renal impairment,"" along with other renal-related issues such as ""oliguria"" (low urine output), ""proteinuria"" (presence of protein in urine), and ""azotemia"" (elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine).

These mentions on the drug label suggest that there is evidence of renal-related adverse reactions that have been attributed to lincomycin use. Although acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly mentioned by name, the symptoms and disorders noted (i.e., renal impairment, oliguria, proteinuria, azotemia) could be indicative of or associated with AKI. Medical literature often discusses AKI in the context of such manifestations because it can encompass a spectrum of conditions ranging from minor alterations in kidney function to severe impairment.

The label itself—the official communication provided by the drug manufacturer and approved by regulatory bodies such as the FDA—serves as a source of evidence, as it is based on a range of data including clinical trials, case studies, post-marketing surveillance, and scientific literature. While the drug label does not provide detailed references to specific studies or reports, it is the culmination of such evidence presented in a summarized, regulatory-approved format.

In summary, while the drug label for lincomycins does not explicitly mention ""acute kidney injury"" as an adverse reaction, it does list renal-related adverse reactions that are associated with kidney dysfunction. The presence of these adverse reactions in the drug label implies that there has been sufficient evidence, gathered from clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance, to warrant their inclusion as potential risks of lincomycin therapy. To obtain more detailed evidence, consultation of original research articles, case reports or clinical trial data where these adverse reactions were first noted would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,linezolid,,"The provided drug label information for linezolid does not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or postmarketing experience. However, the label outlines various adverse reactions, myelosuppression, and laboratory abnormalities that have been identified during clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. Notably, laboratory abnormalities include hematologic and serum chemistry value changes.

In the clinical trials subsection (6.1) of the drug label, there is a detailed account of the adverse reactions experienced by adult and pediatric patients treated with linezolid. Adverse reactions such as diarrhea, vomiting, headache, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and changes in liver function tests are included. Importantly, Table 5 from the label shows that an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (indicators of kidney function) occurred in a small percentage of adult patients and pediatric patients, which can suggest renal impairment. However, the incidence of substantially abnormal creatinine levels appears low and the label does not directly connect these findings to acute kidney injury.

Postmarketing experience (6.2), which can often reveal additional adverse effects not captured in clinical trials, lists myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathy, lactic acidosis, serotonin syndrome, convulsions, anaphylaxis, angioedema, bullous skin disorders, tooth discoloration, hypoglycemia, and hyponatremia/Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) as identified adverse reactions. AKI is not mentioned in this section either.

However, postmarketing surveillance data inherently has limitations such as underreporting, reporting bias, and lack of control groups, which can make it challenging to establish a causal relationship between a drug and an adverse event like AKI. Additionally, while the label warns of myelosuppression and mentions renal impairment in relation to thrombocytopenia, there is no direct warning or precaution listed for renal toxicity or acute kidney injury.

In summary, based on the provided drug label information, there is no clear evidence or explicit mention that links linezolid with acute kidney injury. Low incidences of abnormal serum creatinine and BUN levels were reported, but these findings are not definitively characterized as AKI within the clinical trial data. Further research outside of the label information, such as independent studies or case reports, would be necessary to evaluate if there is an association between linezolid and the occurrence of acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,liraglutide,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of liraglutide is mentioned in section 5.5 of the prescribing information under ""Warnings and Precautions."" Although the clinical trials (section 6.1) conducted on VICTOZA, which is a brand of liraglutide, did not list AKI as a common adverse reaction, postmarketing reports (section 6.2) have indicated occurrences of AKI. Some of these reports were among patients without known preexisting renal conditions and often involved other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. These conditions can exacerbate renal impairment and potentially lead to AKI.

From the details provided:

- It is unclear how many of these postmarketing reports of AKI are solely attributable to liraglutide, as they may also result from confounding factors such as concomitant medications affecting renal function or patients' hydration status.
- Reported cases suggesting a relationship between liraglutide and AKI include instances requiring hemodialysis.
- In response to the reported adverse events, the label advises caution when initiating or increasing VICTOZA doses in patients with renal impairment.

The prescribing information does not provide specific incidence rates or findings from controlled clinical trials regarding AKI in relation to liraglutide use. Instead, it emphasizes the need for caution based on postmarketing data.

In summary, evidence supporting a direct relationship between liraglutide and AKI primarily stems from voluntary postmarketing reports rather than controlled clinical trials. These reports suggest an association that warrants caution, particularly among patients with existing renal impairment or acute conditions that might predispose them to renal dysfunction. However, a direct causal link cannot be established without further evidence. Health professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to enhance the dataset and inform clinical practice.",NA
acute kidney injury,liraglutide,,"The comprehensive information provided does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as a known adverse reaction of liraglutide (Saxenda). Instead, it discusses adverse reactions and complications that may be associated with, or lead to, renal impairment in certain cases.

Specifically, under section 6.2 Post Marketing Experience, it is reported that ""Renal and Urinary Disorders"" including ""increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure or worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis"" have been observed in the post-marketing period. While it isn't directly stated as acute kidney injury, the terms acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure indicate possible kidney dysfunction related to the drug.

The label also mentions a causal relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and possibly subsequent renal impairment or failure (section 5.6 Renal Impairment). It states that a majority of these observed renal events were associated with volume depletion potentially linked to the GI side effects of liraglutide, and that caution should be exercised when initiating or escalating doses of Saxenda in patients with renal impairment.

Overall, evidence of AKI specifically as an adverse reaction to liraglutide is not described in the provided sections of the prescribing information. However, post-marketing reports suggest a relationship between the drug and renal impairment, possibly due to dehydration secondary to gastrointestinal side effects or other factors. Care should be taken when using Saxenda, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal conditions, and monitoring renal function may be advisable.",NA
acute kidney injury,lisinopril,1.0,"Evidence from the provided drug label sections indicates that acute kidney injury can occur as a potential adverse reaction to lisinopril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. This evidence is derived from clinical trials and post-marketing experience with the drug. Here are the relevant findings:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Hypertension: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in about 2% of patients with hypertension treated with lisinopril alone.
   - Heart Failure: There were reversible minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in 11.6% of patients with heart failure on concomitant diuretic therapy.
   - Acute Myocardial Infarction: In the GISSI-3 trial, patients treated with lisinopril exhibited a higher incidence (2.4% vs. 1.1% in placebo) of renal dysfunction in-hospital and at six weeks, characterized by increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration.
   
2. Post-marketing Experience:
   - Although not explicitly stated as acute kidney injury or acute renal failure, the label mentions the following relevant points: ""Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed..."" and ""Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with lisinopril.""

These label sections imply that lisinopril exposure may be associated with changes in renal function, including acute kidney injury, shown by increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. In patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with lisinopril, a higher incidence of renal dysfunction was reported compared to a placebo.

It is also noted in the warnings (5.3 Impaired Renal Function) that ""changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system,"" and advice is given to monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril. This statement underscores the established relationship between lisinopril use and potential renal adverse effects.

In summary, the evidence from the provided label sections supports the conclusion that lisinoprimil use is associated with a risk of acute kidney injury. This information is consistent with what is known about ACE inhibitors, a class of drugs of which lisinopril is a member, and their potential impact on renal function.","NA

The available sections of the drug label for lisinopril, including adverse reactions (6.1), clinical trials experience, post-marketing experience, and warnings and precautions (5), do not provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure. In fact, the label explicitly states that renal dysfunction, including increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, has been observed in patients treated with lisinopril. It also states that acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, which includes lisinopril. Therefore, there is no evidence presented in these sections to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and lisinopril exposure."
acute kidney injury,losartan,,"The provided drug label sections for losartan do not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction (≥2% incidence and greater than placebo). The most frequently reported adverse reactions include dizziness, upper respiratory infection, nasal congestion, and back pain.

Regarding kidney-related effects and losartan, the label mentions renal function deterioration, including acute renal failure, as a potential concern under section 5.3 (Warnings and Precautions). It highlights that changes in renal function can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, such as losartan. It specifically notes that patients with certain conditions, like renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion, who also depend partially on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system for maintaining renal function, may be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure while on losartan. Therefore, it advises monitoring renal function periodically in these patient populations and suggests withholding or discontinuing therapy if there is a clinically significant decrease in renal function.

The details from clinical trials included in the label do not appear to report AKI as a notable adverse event, as incidences of adverse events generally were similar between losartan and placebo, with no specific emphasis on renal complications, except for the more generic terms like 'renal function deterioration' and 'acute renal failure.' The latter terms may encompass a range of kidney impairments, including AKI, but the document doesn't offer incidence rates or detailed findings on this.

The post-marketing experience section (6.2) of the label cites additional adverse reactions reported with losartan, although AKI is not specifically listed here either. However, the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports means it might not capture all adverse events or establish reliable frequency estimates. Moreover, acute renal failure might be underreported due to it not being immediately apparent or its manifestation being delayed.

In summary, the evidence for AKI as an adverse reaction to losartan is implied in the drug label's warnings about potential renal function deterioration and acute renal failure, particularly in certain high-risk patients. While no explicit incidence rates or detailed clinical trial data for AKI specifically are provided in the sections of the label shared, the implication based on the renin-angiotensin system's involvement in renal function suggests there is a relationship. Additional sources, such as renal-specific clinical studies or observational reports, would be necessary to establish a clearer picture of the incidence and severity of AKI specifically related to losartan use.",NA
acute kidney injury,lurasidone,,"Review of the provided drug label sections does not identify acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reported adverse reaction of lurasidone in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The sections outlined include a comprehensive list of adverse reactions associated with lurasidone, warnings, precautions, and post-marketing experience, but AKI is not mentioned.

The sections describe various other adverse reactions and safety concerns including metabolic changes, orthostatic hypotension, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, and the potential for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, among others. Additionally, there are described effects on serum creatinine levels, which is a marker for kidney function, with shifts from normal to higher values reported in some patients taking lurasidone. However, this does not specifically equate to AKI and no direct evidence linking lurasidone to acute kidney injury is provided within the sections of the drug label.

Based on the information provided, there is no known evidence within the sections of the drug label to support a relationship between lurasidone exposure and acute kidney injury. As no specific studies or reports of AKI are referenced in the sections, the summary conclusion is that AKI is not currently identified as an adverse reaction of lurasidone according to these sections of the drug label.",NA
acute kidney injury,lurasidone,,"Based on the provided drug label information, acute kidney injury is not listed among the commonly observed adverse reactions or discussed in detail for patients treated with lurasidone (LATUDA). The adverse reactions specified in the drug label primarily include increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, cerebrovascular adverse reactions including stroke in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, metabolic changes (including weight gain, hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia), hyperprolactinemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, orthostatic hypotension and syncope, falls, seizures, potential for cognitive and motor impairment, body temperature dysregulation, activation of mania/hypomania, dysphagia, and neurological adverse reactions in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies.

The drug label sections report changes in laboratory measurements for serum creatinine, which is a marker for kidney function, but there are no specific mentions of acute kidney injury being a direct adverse reaction from lurasidone treatment. Serum creatinine levels showed slight increases in some study subgroups, but this is not necessarily indicative of acute kidney injury without further context. Moreover, the label does not establish a clear causal relationship between lurasidone and acute kidney injury.

Given that the provided sections do not discuss acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction, there is no known evidence directly supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to lurasidone based on the information provided from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. Additionally, any spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions, if available, could be found through contacting Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. or by accessing the FDA's MedWatch reporting system.

For a definitive assessment of all known adverse reactions related to lurasidone, additional sources such as peer-reviewed articles, case reports, pharmacovigilance databases, or more detailed analysis of the clinical trial data may need to be consulted. If acute kidney injury is observed in patients taking lurasidone, healthcare providers are encouraged to report these cases to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals and the FDA MedWatch program to contribute to the understanding of the drug’s safety profile.",NA
acute kidney injury,luspatercept,,"Upon review of the provided drug label sections for luspatercept (REBLOZYL), acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction in clinical trials, case studies, post-marketing surveillance, or under the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the label. 

The safety of luspatercept has been evaluated in patients with beta thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and other associated anemias during clinical trials. The reported adverse reactions include thrombosis/thromboembolism, hypertension, extramedullary hematopoietic masses, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, dizziness/vertigo, nausea, diarrhea, cough, abdominal pain, dyspnea, peripheral edema, hypersensitivity reactions, upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, hyperuricemia, and increased liver enzymes among others. Additionally, shifts in laboratory abnormalities such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) changes and elevations in bilirubin were noted, which could be indirectly related to renal function. However, it is important to note that a direct link to acute kidney injury as a specific adverse reaction of luspatercept is not stated.

In the COMMANDS trial, one of the laboratory abnormalities monitored included glomerular filtration rate, which may imply consideration of kidney function during the trial. Still, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury.

Based on the information provided, there does not appear to be direct, known evidence that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction to luspatercept as reported in the sections for adverse reactions, warnings, or boxed warnings. It is, however, recommended to continue monitoring clinical guidelines and safety data to identify any future evidence that might establish such a link.",NA
acute kidney injury,mannitol,,"The provided sections of the drug label highlight the safety and adverse reaction profile of BRONCHITOL, which contains mannitol; however, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not mentioned in the label sections you have provided.

Upon evaluation of the evidence from the clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance provided in the drug label for BRONCHITOL, the following is determined:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: Three 26-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials with 1,020 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients provided data on the safety profile of BRONCHITOL. The trials included 761 adult patients, with 414 receiving BRONCHITOL and 347 receiving control (inhaled mannitol). Results showed that 18.8% of patients treated with BRONCHITOL experienced serious adverse reactions compared to 18.4% for the control group. The adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 1% and more frequent in BRONCHITOL-treated patients included CF exacerbations, hemoptysis, and lower respiratory tract infection. Adverse reactions with ≥3% incidence that were more frequent than control included cough, hemoptysis, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, bacteria in sputum, pyrexia, and arthralgia. Acute kidney injury is not listed among the adverse reactions in the clinical trials data provided.

2. Warnings and Precautions: The label details potential risks for bronchospasm and hemoptysis with BRONCHITOL use. A BRONCHITOL Tolerance Test (BTT) should be conducted to assess the risk of bronchospasm before prescribing. If bronchospasm occurs or if a patient has a history of significant hemoptysis, BRONCHITOL use should be discontinued. There is no warning or precaution mentioned concerning acute kidney injury.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: There is no data provided from post-marketing surveillance regarding the incidence of acute kidney injury associated with mannitol use.

Based on the information available in the provided sections of the drug label, there is no reported evidence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction connected to mannitol exposure in the context of BRONCHITOL. It is essential for healthcare providers to remain vigilant and report any suspected adverse reactions through appropriate channels to enable ongoing safety monitoring and evidence accumulation.

If there are other sources of information regarding mannitol and acute kidney injury outside of the provided drug label that you would like to be evaluated, please provide them for further review.","NA

The information provided does not include any evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to mannitol (as BRONCHITOL or control inhaled mannitol). Acute kidney injury is not mentioned in the adverse reactions, warnings, or clinical trial experience sections provided for the drug. Hence, no summary of evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and mannitol can be given based on the information available here. If there were any reports or studies specifically investigating this potential adverse reaction, they are not included in the provided sections of the drug label."
acute kidney injury,maribavir,,"The clinical trial data provided in the drug label does not directly indicate that acute kidney injury is a notable adverse reaction specifically attributable to maribavir, the active ingredient in LIVTENCITY. According to the drug label's section 6 ""ADVERSE REACTIONS,"" the most common adverse reactions in subjects treated with LIVTENCITY were taste disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. Acute kidney injury was not listed as a common adverse event in patients treated with maribavir.

However, the label does note that acute kidney injury was one of the most commonly reported causes of study drug discontinuation in the Investigator-Assigned Treatment (IAT) group, at a rate of 5%. IAT included therapies with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, which are known to potentially cause nephrotoxicity. This adverse event leading to discontinuation implicates acute kidney injury associated with treatments other than maribavir.

In ""Table 3: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in Trial 303,"" there is a reporting of creatinine elevations, with 7% of subjects in the LIVTENCITY group recording creatinine levels >2.5 mg/dL. High creatinine levels are a marker of kidney dysfunction, which could possibly indicate kidney injury. However, the occurrence of elevated creatinine was higher in the IAT group (10%) than in the LIVTENCITY group (7%), suggesting that if there is a connection between maribavir and kidney injury, it may not be as significant as with the other antiviral agents used in the control group.

Post-marketing surveillance could potentially provide additional evidence for acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to maribavir, but such data is not provided within the provided drug label sections.

In conclusion, based on the evidence available from the provided sections of the drug label, acute kidney injury is not clearly established as a common adverse reaction to maribavir. It appears to be more commonly associated with the comparison treatments in the clinical trial data. Nonetheless, instances of elevated creatinine in the LIVTENCITY group suggest the possibility of kidney dysfunction which could warrant further investigation. Continued post-marketing surveillance would be necessary to further elucidate the relationship between maribavir and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,meclofenamate,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for meclofenamate (an NSAID), there is some evidence supporting a potential relationship between meclofenamate exposure and acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction.

In the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section of the label, under ""Incidence Less Than 1%—Probably Causally Related,"" renal failure is listed. This suggests that during controlled clinical trials or through post-marketing surveillance, instances of renal failure, which includes acute kidney injury, were observed in patients taking meclofenamate. Given that this adverse reaction is cataloged under ""probably causally related,"" the probability exists that a causal relationship between meclofenamate and the renal failure observed has been established, albeit in less than 1% of the patients.

No further specific details, such as exact numbers, patient characteristics, or related risk factors, are provided in this summary regarding the incidents of acute kidney injury. Hence, while the evidence for acute kidney injury as a reaction to meclofenamate is known, the low reported incidence and the lack of detailed data make it difficult to determine the strength or clinical significance of this relationship.

It is important to understand that adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% can still be clinically significant, particularly in populations with risk factors for kidney injury. Moreover, post-marking surveillance data is subject to underreporting and may not fully capture the extent of the issue.

Healthcare providers are typically encouraged to monitor kidney function in patients taking NSAIDs, including meclofenamate, especially those with existing renal impairment or other risks for kidney injury. The relationship between NSAIDs and renal complications is well established, as NSAIDs can alter kidney hemodynamics, leading to renal insufficiency in susceptible individuals. 

To draw a precise conclusion for the specific relationship between acute kidney injury and meclofenamate and understand the full scope of the adverse reaction risk, further investigation and more detailed clinical data would be required.",NA
acute kidney injury,mefenamate,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for mefenamic acid, there is evidence supporting acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction from its use. The drug label explicitly mentions several renal-related adverse effects under both the ""Clinical Trials Experience"" and ""Other adverse reactions"" categories. These include:

- Abnormal renal function
- Interstitial nephritis
- Oliguria/polyuria (decreased or increased urination)
- Proteinuria (presence of protein in urine)
- Renal failure

Renal toxicity is also highlighted in the ""Warnings"" section of the label, which refers to risks such as renal toxicity and hyperkemia.

Clinical trials, as referenced in the label, have reported adverse reactions; however, they are noted to vary and cannot be directly compared to rates in other drug trials. Precise details, such as the incidence rate of acute kidney injury in these trials, are not provided in the text you have supplied.

In addition to clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance is another important source of information on drug safety. While no specific post-marketing surveillance data are cited in your excerpt, such surveillance often provides real-world evidence of adverse drug reactions, including acute kidney injury, which may only become apparent after more widespread use of the drug.

It is important to note that the presence of renal-related adverse effects on the label denotes that there have been observations of these effects either in clinical trial settings, post-marketing reports, or both. The phrase ""including but not limited to"" that often precedes adverse effect lists in drug labels suggests that this is not an exhaustive list, and other renal effects, possibly including acute kidney injury, may still occur.

To conclude, the evidence from the drug label points to a recognized relationship between mefenamic acid use and renal-related adverse effects, including acute kidney injury. However, for a more comprehensive risk analysis and incidence rates, further details from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance reports would be required, which are not included in the provided text. Health care providers should monitor renal function in patients taking mefenamic acid, especially in those with pre-existing renal impairment or other risk factors for renal toxicity.",NA
acute kidney injury,megestrol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for megestrol acetate, there is no direct evidence listed in the adverse reactions (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS), warnings (5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS), or post-marketing experience (6.3 Postmarketing Experience) that links acute kidney injury specifically to megestrol acetate use. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned as a reported adverse event in the clinical trial data (6.2 Clinical Trial Experience) nor in the postmarketing experience. 

The clinical trial experience section (6.2) reports adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients, and while it lists various reactions ranging from gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, flatulence) to hormonal disturbances (impotence), and cardiovascular effects (hypertension), renal-related adverse reactions such as acute kidney injury are not included.

Furthermore, in section 6.3 (Postmarketing Experience), the label reports thromboembolic phenomena and glucose intolerance among the adverse reactions identified after the drug was released in the market; however, acute kidney injury is not mentioned either.

From the information given, it can be concluded that there is no known evidence within the provided sections of the label to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and megestrol acetate exposure. If there have been any reported cases or studies linking the drug with acute kidney injury outside of the provided label details, those sources were not supplied for review. It is important to note that the absence of evidence in the provided sections does not rule out the possibility entirely; health care professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the proper drug safety monitoring systems, which could include potential kidney events.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided label sections, and limitations exist if additional information on megestrol acetate outside of this provided content identifies other findings or reports not captured here.","The provided drug label sections for megestrol acetate—particularly under ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS,"" ""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS,"" and ""6.3 Postmarketing Experience""—do not explicitly list acute kidney injury as a suspected or confirmed adverse reaction resulting from drug exposure. The adverse reactions detailed range from gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, diarrhea) to endocrine disturbances (e.g., exacerbation of diabetes mellitus), and there is no mention of acute kidney injury directly associated with this drug.

Therefore, based on the lack of reported evidence in the available drug label sections and postmarketing experience, there seems to be no evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and megestrol acetate use. However, it is important to note that the absence of evidence in the drug label is not the same as evidence of absence; it could be due to a lack of research, underreporting, or the condition not being recognized as related to the medication. Additionally, since postmarketing surveillance often depends on voluntary reporting, less common or unrecognized adverse events may not be sufficiently captured.

To make definitive claims about the lack of association between acute kidney injury and megestrol acetate, further investigation, including reviews of clinical trial data, observational studies, and robust postmarketing surveillance reports, would be necessary. Only with such data can a clear refutation or confirmation of this potential adverse reaction be established."
acute kidney injury,meloxicam,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can be drawn from the sections provided, particularly the ""Renal Toxicity"" subsection under ""Warnings and Precautions (5.6)"" in the drug label.

Clinical Trials Experience: No specific mention of acute kidney injury is noted in the clinical trials section (6.1). Adverse reactions affecting the urinary system are documented but are confined to increased micturition frequency, urinary tract infections, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

Warnings and Precautions (5.6): Meloxicam may cause ""renal toxicity,"" which includes a spectrum of renal injuries, such as renal papillary necrosis and acute renal failure. The drug label indicates that long-term administration of NSAIDs like meloxicam has resulted in such adverse renal outcomes. Patients at the highest risk are cited as those with ""impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction,"" and those taking certain therapeutics like diuretics or ACE inhibitors. There is a specific warning about avoiding meloxicam use in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function.

Postmarketing Experience (6.2): While less systematically studied, the postmarketing experience suggests that adverse reactions including ""renal failure"" (which encompasses acute kidney injury) have been reported. However, a direct causal relationship to meloxicam is not established through this data due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the lack of control for confounding factors in these cases.

The provided label information indicates that there is evidence supporting the potential for meloxicam to cause renal toxicity, which can include acute kidney injury, especially in patients with pre-existing risk factors or concomitant conditions. The relationship between meloxicam and renal adverse reactions is addressed through warnings, suggesting that the evidence is significant enough to warrant caution in prescribing this medication to at-risk populations. The evidence comes from general knowledge about NSAID-related renal effects, as documented in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label, rather than specific outcomes from clinical trials or quantifiable postmarketing data.",NA
acute kidney injury,melphalan,,"The information provided from the drug label does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction to melphalan. However, it does note that a ""temporary significant elevation of the blood urea"" has been seen in the early stages of therapy in patients with renal damage. Blood urea elevation can be a marker of decreased kidney function, which could indicate that there may be an association between melphalan administration and renal impairment in patients who already have underlying renal damage.

Given the context in which ""temporary significant elevation of the blood urea"" is mentioned, it is reasonable to hypothesize that there may be a potential for melphalan to exacerbate renal impairment, possibly leading to acute kidney injury, especially in those with pre-existing renal conditions. Nevertheless, AKI is not listed directly as an adverse reaction, so it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the causal relationship between melphalan exposure and AKI solely based on the information provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections of the drug label.

To make a conclusive statement, additional evidence would be necessary, ideally from clinical trials or observational studies focusing on renal outcomes, case studies documenting instances of AKI following melphalan exposure, or post-marketing surveillance data that reveal a pattern of renal complications concurrent with the drug's use. Without such evidence, it is important to avoid over-interpreting the provided information as confirmation of a clear cause-and-effect relationship between melphalan and AKI. 

In the absence of further information, healthcare providers should remain vigilant for signs of renal impairment in patients receiving melphalan, particularly those with known risk factors for kidney injury. If any healthcare professionals or patients have suspected adverse reactions, such as acute kidney injury, they should be reported to the manufacturer, Avenacy Inc., or the FDA's MedWatch program, as the drug label instructs. This can contribute to the post-marketing surveillance data that helps to refine the understanding of a drug's safety profile.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury is not listed as a known adverse reaction to melphalan. The provided sections cover a range of observed adverse reactions, including hematologic effects (like bone marrow suppression), gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatic disorders, hypersensitivity reactions, and miscellaneous effects such as temporary elevation of blood urea in patients with prior renal damage. However, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction.

It's important to note that the temporary elevation of blood urea could be associated with kidney function, but without clear evidence of acute kidney injury being directly caused by melphalan, the causal relationship cannot be established based on the provided label information."
acute kidney injury,memantine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for memantine, acute kidney injury has been identified as a potential adverse reaction in the post-marketing experience. This information is derived from voluntary reports and is not quantified through controlled clinical trials. Here is the summary of the available evidence regarding acute kidney injury and memanitine exposure:

**Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):**
The adverse reactions reported during the clinical trials did not prominently feature acute kidney injury. During controlled clinical studies, 940 patients with dementia were treated with memantine for up to 28 weeks, and the most common reactions were dizziness, headache, confusion, and constipation. No mention of acute kidney injury is made in this section.

**Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):**
In the postmarketing setting, renal and urinary disorders have been reported. Specifically, acute renal failure, which includes increased creatinine and renal insufficiency, has been cited as an after-approval adverse event. However, because these reports are voluntary, and the population size is uncertain, it's not possible to reliably estimate the frequency of this reaction or firmly establish a causal relationship to memantine exposure.

**Warnings and Precautions (Section 5):**
The label does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury as a warning or precaution. It does note that conditions that increase urine pH might decrease the urinary elimination of memantine, leading to higher plasma levels of the drug, which could theoretically lead to or exacerbate renal issues.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not highlighted as a common adverse event in clinical trial data, it has been reported in the post-marketing phase. A causal relationship has not been conclusively established due to the limitations of voluntary reporting systems. Additional surveillance and research may be needed to further quantify this relationship and provide more detailed risk assessment.

It is also crucial to consider that individual patient risk factors, concurrent medications, and underlying health conditions might contribute to the risk of acute kidney injury when taking memantine. Health care professionals should monitor renal function as indicated and consider all potential risks when prescribing or managing therapy involving memantine.",NA
acute kidney injury,meropenem,,"Based on the provided sections of the meropenem drug label, evidence suggests that acute kidney injury (AKI) can be an adverse reaction associated with the use of this medication. Details from the included information are as follows:

1. Clinical Trials:
   In adult patients treated with meropenem for non-CNS infections, changes in renal function markers were noted, including increased creatinine and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN). These laboratory changes were reported in greater than 0.2% of the patients and are indicative of kidney dysfunction, which could potentially manifest as acute kidney injury.

2. Specific Populations:
   The incidence of kidney failure, which can be a direct presentation of acute kidney injury, was higher in patients with moderately severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 to 26 mL/min), suggesting that the drug's impact on renal function may be more pronounced in this population.

3. Post-marketing Experience:
   Although the post-marketing section does not directly mention acute kidney injury, reports of kidney failure have been received during post-approval use of meropenem. It is important to note that post-marketing surveillance often relies on voluntary reporting of adverse events, so the available data may not represent the full scope of the issue.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggests that meropenem can be associated with renal adverse reactions, including increased creatinine and BUN levels, along with reported cases of kidney failure. Patients with pre-existing renal impairment appear to be at increased risk. As acute kidney injury can be a consequence of kidney failure, these data support a relationship between meropenem exposure and the potential for this adverse reaction.

For a more comprehensive assessment and potential updates beyond my knowledge cutoff date, it is advisable to consult current medical literature, product information, and post-marketing surveillance databases.",NA
acute kidney injury,mesalamine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is suggested evidence of a relationship between acute kidney injury and mesalamine exposure through post-marketing surveillance, despite the absence of specific incidence rates reported from clinical trials. The drug label lists ""nephrotoxicity"" as an adverse event identified during post-approval use of products containing mesalamine, which infers that instances of kidney injury associated with its use have been observed following the drug's market release.

It's important to note that adverse events reported during post-marketing are not always subject to the controlled conditions of a clinical trial and that such reports are voluntarily submitted, which can make it challenging to firmly establish causality or frequency. Nonetheless, these real-world data points still provide valuable insight into potential drug reactions that may not have been sufficiently captured during premarket testing.

Clinical trials, as mentioned in the provided drug label sections, do not report acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction, with most reported effects being mild and transient. However, the presence of renal disorders such as nephrotoxicity in the postmarketing experience implies that there have been observations of acute kidney injury related to mesalamine use in clinical practice.

According to this information, while the controlled clinical trial data provided does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as an outcome, post-marketing surveillance suggests there is a potential connection. Health care professionals should be aware of this possibility and monitor renal function as necessary in patients receiving mesalamine treatment. Patients are also advised to report any symptoms suggestive of kidney injury to their health care provider.",NA
acute kidney injury,methotrexate,,"The relationship between acute kidney injury and methotrexate exposure is supported by evidence from post-marketing surveillance.

According to the drug label provided, renal toxicity, including irreversible acute renal failure, is identified as an adverse reaction observed during post-approval use of methotrexate (Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience). While such observations are voluntarily reported and the exact frequency of these reactions is uncertain, they propose a relationship between methotrexate exposure and acute kidney injury.

The warning and precautions section of the label (Section 5.8 Renal Toxicity) further advises monitoring renal function at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. It points out that methotrexate can cause renal toxicity, manifesting as acute renal failure, which may be irreversible.

While direct evidence from controlled clinical trials—such as incidence rates comparing methotrexate with placebo—is not provided in this section of the drug label, the postmarketing experience reflects real-world evidence gathered after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use.

As no specific details from clinical trials or case studies are mentioned in relation to acute kidney injury, my summary relies on the evidence provided by postmarketing surveillance as documented in the drug label. 

Healthcare professionals are instructed to withhold or disprove methotrexate in cases of severe renal toxicity, considering the severity of renal adverse reactions and the availability of alternative therapy options. The occurrence of renal adverse reactions is taken seriously, indicating the potential for methotrexate to induce kidney injury in patients.",NA
acute kidney injury,micafungin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and micafungin exposure can be derived from several sources provided in the sections highlighted, including clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings and precautions from the drug label.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
The report from clinical trials doesn't explicitly mention acute kidney injury as a common adverse event in adult or pediatric populations treated with micafungin. However, there are mentions of abnormalities in renal-related laboratory tests. Elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine have been noted, which can be indicators of renal impairment.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
Beyond clinical trials, in the postmarketing phase, there have been reported isolated cases of renal impairment or acute renal failure. Since these reports are voluntary, the exact frequency of this adverse reaction is uncertain, and a causal relationship to micafungin exposure is not clearly established but is suggested.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The section on renal effects (5.4) advises monitoring renal function due to elevations in BUN and creatinine and also reports isolated cases of significant renal impairment or acute renal failure. It is important to note that the incidence rate in the comparative fluconazole-controlled trials was very low at 0.4% for micafungin-treated patients.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not highlighted as a main adverse effect of micafungin in clinical trial data, there is evidence from both post-marketing reports and the renal effects warning section to suggest that micafungin may be associated with renal impairment, including isolated cases of acute kidney injury. Further research may be needed to clarify the strength of the association and the mechanisms by which micafungin may lead to AKI. Monitoring renal function in patients receiving micafungin is recommended based on the potential for renal adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,midazolam,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to midazolam. The label details a range of cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, and other systemic adverse reactions, as well as warnings about the use of midazolam, particularly concerning cardiorespiratory depression and the risks from concomitant opioid use.

Acute kidney injury is not listed under the adverse reactions section nor in the warnings, which suggests that either AKI is not a recognized adverse reaction to midazolam based on clinical trials, case studies, post-marketing surveillance data, or if it does occur, it is an extremely rare complication that has not been documented sufficiently to warrant inclusion in the label.

Post-marketing surveillance is a critical component for identifying adverse drug reactions that were not captured during clinical trials. If events of AKI related to midazolam had been identified post-marketing and were considered causally related to the drug exposure, they would be expected to be included in this section of the label.

It’s important to note that the absence of evidence in the drug label does not entirely rule out the possibility of midazolam being associated with AKI in rare or idiosyncratic cases. However, based on the information provided in the drug label sections given, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between midazolam exposure and acute kidney injury. Health care providers rely on information reported in the drug label, but they also consider medical literature and clinical experience when assessing potential drug risks. Before concluding, one should also review the latest literature and other medical databases for any case reports or observational studies that may have surfaced since the latest drug label update.","NA

Based on the information provided, there is no evidence presented in the provided drug label sections that refutes the relationship between acute kidney injury and midazolam exposure. As such, I cannot provide a summary of evidence refuting acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction of midazolam. The label information primarily discusses respiratory and cardiovascular adverse reactions, CNS effects, and specifics about dosing and safe administration, without mentioning renal adverse reactions like acute kidney injury. Moreover, the details for reporting suspected adverse reactions suggest that any additional adverse events not listed would be captured through post-marketing surveillance and individual case reports. Without explicit evidence to the contrary, no conclusions can be made regarding the absence of a relationship between acute kidney injury and midazolam from the information provided."
acute kidney injury,midostaurin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to midostaurin is derived from clinical trial experience and post-marketing surveillance.

From the provided drug label for midostaurin (RYDAPT), under the ""Clinical Trials Experience"" section (6.1), there is a direct mention of renal insufficiency as an adverse reaction. Specifically, it notes that in a randomized, double-blind trial involving patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the RYDAPT arm included renal insufficiency, with a 1% incidence. In the context of this clinical trial, renal insufficiency includes acute kidney injury.

In the advanced systemic mastocytosis studies (Study 2 and Study 3) described in the label, Grade 3/4 renal insufficiency had a 5% incidence. AKI is included in the grouped terms for renal insufficiency, which supports its association with midostaurin.

Further evidence from the drug label indicates that renal insufficiency, including acute kidney injury, is among the adverse reactions experienced by some patients undergoing treatment with midostaurin. It is important to note that these adverse reactions can range from mild to severe and may warrant discontinuation of the drug.

The inclusion of ""renal insufficiency"" as a Grouped term, which encompasses acute kidney injury, in the section detailing adverse reactions in clinical trials provides a base of evidence for the relationship between AKI and midostaurin exposure. Therefore, while acute kidney injury is not the most common adverse effect, it has been documented in clinical trials as an adverse reaction of note.

The post-marketing experience does not specifically list acute kidney injury, but this does not mean that the condition has not been observed post-marketing; it simply may not have been reported at a rate that is distinguishable from the known clinical trial data or with a clear frequency from spontaneous reports.

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials and grouped terms to support the association between midostaurin treatment and acute kidney injury, although the incidence appears to be relatively low. This information can facilitate informed decisions regarding the monitoring of renal function in patients receiving midostaurin and the management of these potential adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,milnacipran,,"Based on the available sections from the drug label for milnacipran (Savella), there is no direct mention in the provided text of acute kidney injury (AKI) being identified as an adverse reaction from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. However, the post-marketing experience section does report ""acute renal failure"" as an adverse event identified from spontaneous reports. It should be noted that spontaneous reports post-marketing are not always evidence of a causal relationship due to a population of uncertain size and the possibility of concomitant drug use or underlying medical conditions.

To summarize, there is mention in the post-marketing surveillance reports of acute renal failure as an adverse reaction to milnacipran (Savella). But there is no information provided from clinical trials or case studies within this text that specifically establishes a direct causal link between milnacipran use and the development of acute kidney injury. Clinical trial data and case studies are generally more robust sources of evidence, but the absence of such data in this summary does not rule out the potential risk.

Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions, as stated, to AbbVie or the FDA, which suggests there is a system in place for ongoing monitoring of adverse effects, including those that may have been unrecognized at the time of the initial clinical trials.

As this is a summary interpretation of the details provided, it's important for healthcare professionals to review the most current product labeling, consult the full prescribing information, and consider the context of individual patient situations for a comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits of milnacipran (Savella) therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,minocycline,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to minocycline primarily comes from post-marketing surveillance, as the drug label mentions renal toxicity under the adverse reactions section, specifically citing ""interstitial nephritis"" and ""reversible acute renal failure."" While the drug label does not directly mention acute kidney injury, interstitial nephritis is a known cause of AKI, and the reference to reversible acute renal failure also suggests that minocycline can lead to AKI.

Clinical trials are typically designed to assess efficacy and safety within controlled parameters, and while adverse reactions are monitored, they may not always capture rare or long-term effects such as AKI. Hence, the available information on the drug label does not specify clinical trials in relation to AKI as an adverse effect of minocycline.

Case studies are an important source of evidence for understanding rare or severe adverse drug reactions. Individual case reports in the literature have documented instances of AKI in patients taking minocycline. A search in medical databases such as PubMed could provide examples of such reports that detail temporal associations, biopsies confirming interstitial nephritis, and reversibility upon cessation of the drug, which further supports the relationship between minocycline exposure and AKI.

In summary, while the drug label for minocycline does not explicitly mention ""acute kidney injury,"" it does list renal toxicities, including interstitial nephritis and reversible acute renal failure, both of which are associated with AKI. Post-marketing surveillance and case studies in the literature provide additional evidence supporting the notion that minocycline can cause AKI, although the overall frequency of this adverse event and its appearance in clinical trial data is not clearly indicated on the label. Health care providers are encouraged to monitor renal function when prescribing minocycline and consider the possibility of AKI as an adverse reaction, especially in patients with other risk factors for renal impairment. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, one can contact the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or through their MedWatch program.",NA
acute kidney injury,mitomycin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to support the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to mitomycin, specifically in the form of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).

The drug label mentions ""renal toxicity"" and indicates that 2% of 1,281 patients demonstrated a statistically significant rise in creatinine, which is a marker of renal impairment. This observation suggests a potential link between mitomycin administration and renal function compromise. However, it is stated that there appeared to be no correlation between the total dose administered or the duration of therapy and the degree of renal impairment. 

Further, the drug label describes the occurrence of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which includes ""irreversible renal failure"" as one of its primary components, alongside microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. HUS has a high mortality rate associated with it (52% as mentioned in the label), indicating the severity when it occurs. HUS can occur at any dose during treatment with mitomycin but has been seen to occur more frequently at cumulative doses exceeding 60 mg. Patients who have been administered this total dose should be monitored closely for signs of decreasing renal function.

The incidence of HUS is not well-defined according to the label, but it is recognized as a serious complication of chemotherapy that can lead to irreversible renal damage.

This evidence is not derived from prospective clinical trials specifically designed to investigate renal toxicity as an adverse effect of mitomycin; rather, it appears to be based on post-marketing surveillance and reporting of clinical cases. The mechanism by which mitomycin leads to AKI, specifically in the context of HUS, seems related to its cytotoxic effects on the endothelium and induction of microangiopathic processes, although this is not explicitly detailed in the drug label.

In conclusion, the drug label for mitomycin provides evidence of a relationship between mitomycin exposure and acute kidney injury, particularly through the development of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome. This evidence comes from post-marketing reports and surveillance of patients treated with mitomycin, showing renal impairment and a significant association with HUS, particularly at higher cumulative doses.",NA
acute kidney injury,mitoxantrone,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for mitoxantrone, evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and mitoxantrone exposure can be found in the adverse reactions section, which documents clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

In Study 1, involving 149 MS patients, one case of renal failure leading to discontinuation of the drug is reported among patients who received a 12 mg/m^2 dose. The details of the renal failure event, given in the adverse reactions section, describe enough association to consider acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction to mitoxantrone.

Additionally, although not explicitly mentioned in the renal failure context, the drug's label includes safety warnings about the need for close monitoring due to its generalized toxic effects on various body systems, including the potential for organ damage. Mitoxantrone's mechanism of action as a topoisomerase II inhibitor, used in cancer treatment, makes non-specific cytotoxicity a plausible explanation for organ damage, including the kidneys.

While the drug label does not provide a comprehensive set of data specifically correlating mitoxantrone with acute kidney injury, it does present a case of renal failure in a clinical trial setting. The documentation suggests that there is at least some evidence of kidney-related adverse reactions with mitoxantrone exposure. It is important for healthcare professionals to be vigilant about monitoring kidney function during and after treatment with mitoxantrone and to report any further cases of acute kidney injury to enrich the evidence base and improve patient safety. 

In summary, although not extensively documented in the provided label sections, there is an evidence of a single case of acute kidney injury in an MS patient, which supports the potential relationship between mitoxantrone exposure and this serious adverse reaction. Further investigation and data collection would be beneficial to understand the prevalence and mechanisms of this association.","Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence that acute kidney injury could be a potential adverse reaction to mitoxantrone. Specifically, there is a documented case of renal failure leading to discontinuation of treatment in the clinical trial for multiple sclerosis patients, as stated in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section (""Study 1, ... renal failure, ..."").

This signals that although acute kidney injury may not be a commonly reported adverse reaction to mitoxantrone, it has been observed at least once in the context of a clinical trial, which should not be completely dismissed. Hence, stating 'NA' would not be appropriate in this context.

To refute the relationship conclusively, one would typically look for a large-scale epidemiological study or a comprehensive meta-analysis indicating a lack of association between mitoxantrone and acute kidney injury. However, no additional specific evidence to conclusively refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and mitoxantrone use is provided in the label information.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction to mitoxantrone, at least one instance has been reported in clinical trials, indicating that it could potentially occur. Without further specific data or studies refuting this relationship, the association cannot be completely ruled out."
acute kidney injury,mobocertinib,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence suggesting that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potential adverse reaction of mobocertinib, which is indicated for the treatment of EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation-positive, locally advanced, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after platinum-based chemotherapy.

Evidence for an association between mobocertinib and AKI comes from clinical trial data, specifically from Study AP32788-15-101. The reported adverse reactions for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation-positive NSCLC include the following:

- Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients receiving EXKIVITY (mobocertinib), with acute kidney injury mentioned among these serious reactions in ≥2% of patients.
- Non-serious adverse reactions that were less common (<10%) but still clinically relevant included acute kidney injury, which affected 8% of the patients in the trial.
- The most frequent Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities that potentially could relate to AKI include increased creatinine levels noted in 2.7% of patients, indicating that kidney function impairment may occur with the use of the medication.

Mobocertinib has a safety profile that necessitates monitoring for multiple potential adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, with recommendations given to possibly withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue the medication based on the severity of reactions. Patients taking mobocertinib are recommended to have their electrolytes monitored, and the drug may need to be withheld in cases of significant imbalances, which can be associated with renal impairment.

Overall, the evidence from the clinical trial indicates that AKI is a recognized adverse reaction of mobocertinib, and healthcare providers are advised to monitor patients for signs of kidney injury during treatment with this medication.",NA
acute kidney injury,moexipril,1.0,"Based on the presented drug label sections for moexipril hydrochloride, a medication used for the treatment of hypertension, there is evidence to suggest an association between moexipril and adverse renal effects, including acute kidney injury (AKI).

In the clinical laboratory test findings section, the label describes that minor increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine were observed in approximately 1% of patients with essential hypertension who were treated with moexipril. These increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen can be indicative of renal impairment or acute kidney injury. The label states that these increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or those with compromised renal function.

Furthermore, in the renal section, the label notes that of hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal disease, 1% of patients receiving moexipril hydrochloride alone and 2% of patients receiving moexipril hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide experienced significant increases in serum creatinine (at least 140% of their baseline values).

Despite these findings, the incidence of laboratory abnormalities was similar to that observed in the placebo group, and less than 1% of moexipril-treated patients discontinued treatment due to lab abnormalities.

It's important to note that while there is evidence of an association between moexipril and renal changes in a small percentage of patients, the evidence does not fully establish causality for acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. Moreover, post-marketing surveillance data, which could provide additional insights into the relationship between moexipril and acute kidney injury, is not detailed in the information you provided.

In summary, the drug label for moexipril hydrochloride indicates a potential for adverse renal effects, including increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, in a small percentage of patients, which could be indicative of acute kidney injury. However, these findings are relatively rare, and the evidence does not suggest that acute kidney injury is a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to moexipril. Additional post-marketing data would be required to further clarify this potential relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,mogamulizumab,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and mogamulizumab exposure is not explicitly listed in the label sections provided. Mogamulizumab (POTELIGEO) is associated with a range of adverse reactions, some of which can be serious. Clinical trial data from Trial 1 involving 319 patients treated with mogamulizumab list the most common adverse reactions. However, acute kidney injury is not specified among the common adverse reactions (≥20% of patients) which include rash, infusion-related reactions, fatigue, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Moreover, the label details serious adverse reactions from the same trial and while mentioning renal insufficiency in ≥5% but <10% of patients in the POTELIGEO arm, acute kidney injury is not individually identified as a commonly reported issue. Renal insufficiency, however, could imply a less severe form of kidney impairment that does not reach the threshold of acute kidney injury. It is important to recognize that renal insufficiency could potentially progress to acute kidney injury, depending on various patient and treatment factors.

In the section covering laboratory abnormalities, the label does not list acute kidney-related changes, such as an increase in serum creatinine or reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which are typical markers of acute kidney injury.

The postmarketing experience section, which can provide insights into less common but still possible adverse reactions identified after the drug has been approved for use, does not report acute kidney injury as an identified issue during the post-approval use of mogamulizumab.

In the absence of specific evidence of acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction to mogamulizumab within the provided sections of the drug label, we can conclude that acute kidney injury is either not a recognized adverse reaction based on the available clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance, or it may occur at a rate lower than the reporting threshold. Clinicians should monitor renal function as a precaution, considering the drug's associated serious adverse reactions which might indirectly affect kidney function. If new data emerge from ongoing postmarketing surveillance or further studies, this assessment may change.",NA
acute kidney injury,morphine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to morphine use. The adverse reactions and warnings highlight other serious side effects such as addiction, abuse, misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, risk from concomitant use with CNS depressants, and several others, but AKI is not specifically listed.

The most common adverse reactions (>10%) in clinical trials were constipation, nausea, and somnolence. Information from post-marketing experience also does not explicitly report AKI but mentions various other reactions like serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, anaphylaxis, androgen deficiency, hypersensitivity reactions, hypoglycemia, and others.

It's important to note that while AKI is not listed, there could still be rare cases that have not been reported or recognized in the populations studied. Kidney function may be affected by several factors, including the patient's underlying health conditions, use of other medications, and individual variability in response to opioid drugs like morphine.

In summary, there is no evidence provided in the sections of the morphine sulfate extended-release capsules drug label that directly links morphine use to acute kidney injury. However, healthcare providers typically monitor kidney function as part of overall patient management when prescribing medications that are metabolized or excreted by the kidneys, especially in patients at risk for renal impairment. If there are concerns or suspicions of AKI or other renal issues during morphine treatment, they would likely be addressed based on clinical judgment and available medical guidelines.",NA
acute kidney injury,mosunetuzumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for mosunetuzumab (LUNSUMIO), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial data (Section 6.1), warnings, or specifically within the box warnings. The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that were most common during the clinical trials include cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, rash, pyrexia, headache, and hematologic changes such as decreased lymphocyte count and neutrophils, and increased glucose levels, among others.

While the label does note in the section on serious adverse reactions that ""renal insufficiency"" occurred in a certain percentage of patients, it does not specify whether this refers to acute kidney injury or provide detailed incidence rates or characterization of renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency is a broader term that can include various degrees of decreased kidney function and is not necessarily synonymous with acute kidney injury.

From the sections provided, there is a lack of detailed evidence or specific data that directly supports a relationship between mosunetuzumab exposure and the development of acute kidney injury. Therefore, without additional scientific literature or case reports documenting such an association, it cannot be confirmed that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction specifically attributed to mosunetuzumab based on the information from the clinical trial experience or post-marketing surveillance listed in the drug label.

Thus, to state conclusively whether there is a confirmed relationship between acute kidney injury and mosunetuzumab, more in-depth investigation into clinical literature, case reports, and post-marketing data would be required. Manufacturers, health professionals, or patients who have observed such an adverse reaction are encouraged to report these instances to regulatory bodies such as the FDA, as indicated in the section for reporting suspected adverse reactions.",NA
acute kidney injury,moxifloxacin,,"Acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed among the common adverse reactions or warnings for moxifloxacin in the drug label you provided. However, renal and urinary disorders including renal failure are mentioned as less common adverse reactions occurring in 0.1 to 1% of moxifloxacin hydrochloride-treated patients based on clinical trial data (Section 6.1, Table 3). Although ""renal failure"" encompasses a range of renal impairments, it can include acute kidney injury as a potential condition. 

In the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), ""interstitial nephritis"" is listed as an identified adverse reaction, although the frequency of the reaction or a definitive cause-effect relationship to moxifloxacin exposure is not established due to the nature of voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size.

The evidence suggests that while acute kidney injury may not be a commonly reported adverse reaction to moxifloxacin, there is acknowledgement of renal-related adverse events, such as renal failure and interstitial nephritis, in both clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance. Clinical trials have limitations in their ability to detect rare adverse events, and post-marketing surveillance is helpful but not always conclusive for establishing causality.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction to moxifloxacin, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing reports suggesting a potential relationship with moxifloxacin exposure and renal adverse effects such as renal failure and interstitial nephritis. It is important to monitor renal function in patients receiving moxifloxacin, especially those with pre-existing renal impairment or comorbid conditions that may increase the risk of renal adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,mycophenolate mofetil,,"Evidence of a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) exposure based on the provided drug label sections is not directly outlined. The provided sections of the drug label mention adverse reactions, warnings, and side effects associated with mycophenolate mofetil, but do not explicitly list acute kidney injury as a recognized adverse reaction.

Here is a summary of the key points relevant to kidney-related adverse reactions from the provided information:

- Clinical trials involving mycophenolate mofetil primarily reported on its efficacy and safety in preventing acute organ rejection after kidney, heart, and liver transplants. In these studies, mycophenolate mofetil was administered together with cyclosporine and corticosteroids, and some trials included anti-thymocyte globulin.

- The trials reported adverse reactions such as increased blood creatinine, blood urea, and instances of leukopenia, which can indicate issues related to kidney function. However, these findings are not unusual in the context of organ transplantation, where the kidneys may be impacted by various factors, including the underlying health conditions of the patients, the surgery, or the combination of immunosuppressive medications used.

- Adverse reactions related to renal and urinary disorders mentioned in the drug trials are listed as ""blood creatinine increased"" and ""blood urea increased"" in the heart and liver transplant study groups taking mycophenolate mofetil. However, these reactions are not necessarily indicative of acute kidney injury, and the provided information does not allow us to establish a causal relationship between mycophenolate mofetil and AKI.

- Postmarketing experience does not mention AKI as an identified adverse reaction during the use of mycophenolate mofetil.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label information, there is no clearly stated evidence that directly links the use of mycophenolate mofetil to acute kidney injury. Additional sources, such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or further post-marketing surveillance data, would be required to establish a potential relationship between mycophenolate mofetil exposure and acute kidney injury. If such information is available, it could provide a more comprehensive understanding of any possible risks related to kidney function.",NA
acute kidney injury,mycophenolic acid,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction directly associated with mycophenolic acid in either the clinical studies experience (section 6.1) or the reported adverse reactions from postmarketing experience (section 6.2). However, there are references to ""renal impairment"" and ""increased blood creatinine"" in the adverse reactions section (6.1) and ""renal tubular necrosis"" in the less common adverse reactions section (6.1), which can be indicators of possible kidney issues, including AKI.

Additionally, the warnings and precautions section (5.5) mentions ""Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss.” Although not explicitly labeled as AKI, PVAN and deteriorating renal function could encompass AKI as a possible component or outcome.

Furthermore, ""renal impairment"" is listed as a cause of discontinuation in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets arm in clinical trials, indicating a potential link to adverse renal events, which may include AKI. 

The postmarketing experience section (6.2) references ""Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss."" While this does not directly state ""acute kidney injury,"" the terms provided suggest significant kidney damage that could be consistent with AKI.

The evidence of a potential relationship between mycophenolic acid and AKI comes from clinical trial data, case studies, or postmarketing surveillance as inferred from sections on renal associated diseases and conditions. It may be suggested that AKI can be a part of the spectrum of adverse renal effects observed with mycophenolate, but this is not explicitly indicated as a common response to the drug. It is important for healthcare professionals to monitor renal function in patients receiving mycophenolic acid and report suspected cases of AKI or related adverse renal events to enlarge the database of drug safety, which could provide clearer evidence on this potential relationship.","Based on the provided drug label sections for mycophenolic acid, there is no evidence that directly refutes the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to mycophenolic acid. Acute kidney injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials nor explicitly discussed in the warnings or precautions sections.

However, one of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the de novo trial of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets is renal impairment, which occurred in 1% of patients. While renal impairment can be a broad term, it may encompass acute kidney injury. Moreover, under postmarketing experience, renal impairment and renal tubular necrosis are mentioned as reported adverse reactions. Renal tubular necrosis can be a type of acute kidney injury.

Additionally, polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), particularly linked to BK virus infection, is mentioned under the new or reactivated viral infections section (Warnings and Precautions 5.5), which implies a potential risk to renal function and could result in an adverse outcome like acute kidney injury, especially post kidney transplant.

In conclusion, the evidence refuting a direct relationship between acute kidney injury and mycophenolic acid is not explicit in the provided sections of the drug label. However, related renal adverse effects and the implication of other related kidney conditions postulate a possible link, without directly refuting it. Therefore, the summary is 'NA' since there's no direct evidence that categorically refutes acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to mycophenolic acid. Further investigation into clinical data, case reports, and broader post-marketing surveillance might be required for a more conclusive statement."
acute kidney injury,nabumetone,,"Based on the information provided from the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections of the drug label for nabumetone, the relationship between acute kidney injury and nabumetone exposure can be summarized as follows:

Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that, like other NSAIDs, has various potential adverse reactions. Within the adverse reactions detailed in the label for nabumetone, under the Genitourinary heading, it is mentioned that adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% and probably causally related include albuminuria, azotemia, interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) may manifest as a spectrum that includes conditions such as azotemia and acute interstitial nephritis, which are explicitly mentioned on the label. Additionally, ""renal failure"" refers to the loss of kidney function, which can include AKI. These renal-related adverse reactions are aligned with what is known about the class effects of NSAIDs, which are documented to potentially interfere with kidney function due to their effects on renal prostaglandins, leading to conditions that could precipitate AKI.

It is important to note that the incidence of these renal effects is stated to be less than 1%, suggesting that they are relatively uncommon. The reactions listed are described as ""probably causally related,"" indicating that there is evidence to suggest a direct relationship between nabumetone exposure and these renal adverse effects.

Nonetheless, it is unclear from the label whether these adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials or reported post-marketing. The italicized adverse reactions are reported to be rarer and are sourced from worldwide postmarketing experience or the literature—not seen in clinical trials—which implies that certain adverse renal outcomes are known to occur but were not directly observed in the clinical trial setting.

In conclusion, the drug label for nabumetone indicates that there is evidence supporting a potential relationship between nabumetone exposure and adverse renal effects, including acute kidney injury, although these are considered rare (incidence <1%). Sources of evidence are derived from clinical trial data and worldwide post-marketing experience, as well as medical literature. The label advises healthcare providers and patients to be aware of these risks, particularly in individuals with pre-existing kidney function impairment or other risk factors for nephrotoxicity.",NA
acute kidney injury,nafcillin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nafcillin, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and nafcillin exposure. The label specifically mentions ""renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis"" as adverse reactions associated with the drug's administration. These conditions are known to be potential causes of acute kidney injury. Manifestations of this reaction may include but are not limited to rash, fever, eosinophilia, hematuria (blood in the urine), proteinuria (protein in the urine), and renal insufficiency, which is a hallmark of impaired kidney function.

While the drug label does not detail the incidence rates or provide specific data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance, it does list these effects in the Urogenital Reactions section, indicating that there has been previous observation of these adverse reactions in patients using nafcillin. This inclusion in the drug label typically stems from clinical trial experiences, post-marketing reports, or a combination of both that have been sufficiently well-documented to warrant inclusion by regulatory authorities such as the FDA.

To validate this information and provide a more comprehensive summary, one would usually seek data from peer-reviewed literature, case reports, and further details from post-marketing surveillance databases that can give context regarding the frequency and severity of such adverse reactions. However, this detailed information is not provided in the provided sections of the drug label. 

In summary, according to the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to support a relationship between nafcillin and adverse renal effects, including acute kidney injury, although specific incidence rates and detailed studies are not provided. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor kidney function in patients receiving nafcillin therapy and report any suspected adverse events to the FDA.",NA
acute kidney injury,naproxen,1.0,"Evidence for Relationship between Acute Kidney Injury and Naproxen Use:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   The drug label provides information from controlled clinical trials where adverse reactions in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are reported. Adverse events related to renal toxicity, such as abnormal renal function, are mentioned among those occurring in 1% to 10% of the patients taking naproxen. Specific instances of glomerular nephritis, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, renal disease, renal failure, renal papillary necrosis, and increased serum creatinine are listed as adverse effects observed in less than 1% of the patients, indicating that renal-related adverse events are recognized but not highly prevalent in clinical trial settings.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   This section sheds light on the adverse reactions identified after the drug has been approved and is being used by a broader population. Renal-related adverse reactions such as hyperkalemia, interstitial nephritis, renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome are indicated. Since postmarketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, it is challenging to establish a frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure. However, the inclusion of renal-related events suggests that there is evidence of naproxen potentially causing renal toxicity in the postmarketing phase.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   Within the Warnings and Precautions section, under ""Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia"", the label specifically mentions that long-term use of NSAIDs, including naproxen, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. It warns that patients with impaired renal function, heart failure, dehydration, and those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors are at greater risk of renal decompensation. The section advises monitoring renal function and cautions against the use of naproxen in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk.

4. Boxed Warnings:
   While the boxed warnings do not directly reference acute kidney injury, they emphasize serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events related to the use of naproxen.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, as stated in the drug label sections, establishes a relationship between naproxen use and adverse renal effects, which can potentially include acute kidney injury. Clinical trials report renal-related adverse reactions at a low incidence, while postmarketing reports, although limited by reporting bias and lack of exact prevalence figures, reinforce the potential for serious renal adverse reactions. Furthermore, the warnings and precautions included in the label strongly advise monitoring renal function and highlight the risk of renal injury with NSAID use, consistent with the known pharmacological effects of NSAIDs on the kidneys.",NA
acute kidney injury,nebivolol,,"Based on the provided drug label information for nebivolol, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a common adverse reaction specifically observed in clinical trials or within the most common adverse reactions (section 6.1). The adverse reactions reported from the nebivolol clinical studies were primarily related to its pharmacological effect and included headaches, fatigue, bradycardia, diarrhea, nausea, chest pain, dizziness, insomnia, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, with the incidence of each depending on the dosage.

However, in section 6.3 pertaining to post-marketing experience, there is a mention of ""acute renal failure"" as an adverse reaction identified from spontaneous reports of nebivolol use worldwide. It is important to note that these adverse reactions reported post-marketing have been voluntarily provided and are without definitive proof of causation or frequency estimation, thus making it challenging to establish a direct causal relationship to nebivolol exposure.

Further to this, section 5.10 mentions impaired renal function, but it emphasizes that renal clearance of nebivolol is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment rather than explicitly stating that nebivolol causes renal impairment.

Therefore, while there is no robust evidence from clinical trials directly linking nebivolol to AKI, there have been some reports of ""acute renal failure"" in post-marketing surveillance which may warrant further investigation. Prescribers should be alert to this possibility and consider monitoring kidney function in patients treated with nebivolol, especially in those with underlying renal insufficiency or those presenting with symptoms suggestive of AKI.

In summary, there is no clinical trial evidence explicitly associating nebivolol with acute kidney injury, but post-marketing reports indicate that AKI has occurred in individuals taking the drug, albeit without sufficient data to clearly establish causality.",NA
acute kidney injury,neratinib,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trial studies included in the drug label, acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported as an adverse reaction in patients treated with neratinib, particularly when used in combination with capecitabine.

In the NALA study, a phase III clinical trial in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, serious adverse reactions in the neratinib plus capecitabine arm included acute kidney injury, with an incidence of 2.3% for ≥ Grade 2 AKI. This information is specified in Table 8 under the “Renal and urinary disorders” subsection, using the term “Renal impairment” which includes acute kidney injury, blood creatinine increased, renal failure, and renal impairment as varying levels of kidney-related adverse events.

Additionally, the Warnings and Precautions section (5.1) of the drug label mentions ""renal failure"" as a serious adverse reaction in the neratinib arm with a reported incidence of 0.4% during the ExteNET trial, which was a randomized placebo-controlled study in the adjuvant treatment setting of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.

It is important to understand that renal impairment, including AKI, may not be among the most common adverse reactions, but it has been documented as associated with the drug during post-marketing experience. As per standard pharmacovigilance processes and regulatory guidelines, these findings are reflective of the evidence gathered from controlled clinical trial settings and post-marketing surveillance, emphasizing the importance of renal monitoring when patients are treated with neratinib, especially in combination with capecitabine.

No specific details are provided regarding case studies or the prevalence of AKI in a broader patient population outside of the reported clinical trials. Therefore, health care providers should remain vigilant for signs of AKI and consider this potential adverse reaction during neratinib treatment. Additionally, as suggested in the label, renal function should be monitored regularly during neratinib therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,nilotinib,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions in the clinical trial data or post-marketing experience provided for nilotinib (marketed as Tasigna). The information provided focuses on cardio-vascular events, myelosuppression, pancreatitis, elevated serum lipase, hepatotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, and other adverse reactions such as bleeding and fluid retention. Additionally, QT prolongation and sudden deaths have been mentioned with specific advice on monitoring.

Based on the clinical trial data in adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase and those with resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) and CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP), the listed adverse reactions include myelosuppression, cardiovascular events, pancreatitis, elevated serum lipase, hepatotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, bleeding, and fluid retention. Laboratory abnormalities were reported, including effects on hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, and lipase. Furthermore, after treatment discontinuation, some patients experienced a higher frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms.

In the post-marketing experience, thrombotic microangiopathy and facial paralysis were mentioned as adverse reactions, but acute kidney injury was not specifically noted. The post-marketing experience does not always capture every adverse event due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the variable frequency of reporting.

In terms of electrolyte abnormalities, Tasigna can cause hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia, which should be corrected before initiating treatment and monitored periodically. These electrolyte imbalances can sometimes be associated with kidney function, but the provided sections do not make a direct connection to AKI.

In conclusion, according to the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicit evidence in the clinical trials data or post-marketing surveillance directly linking nilotinib with acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. Given the complexity of patients' health statuses and the coexistence of multiple factors that can contribute to AKI, healthcare providers should be vigilant for signs and symptoms that may suggest kidney injury in patients being treated with nilotinib and manage as clinically indicated.",NA
acute kidney injury,niraparib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and niraparib exposure comes from clinical trials data and adverse reactions reported in the post-marketing setting. Niraparib, marketed as ZEJULA, has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancer, including ovarian cancer.

In the PRIMA trial, a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, acute kidney injury was listed as an adverse event occurring in 12% of patients taking niraparib (ZEJULA) as compared to 0.2% of patients receiving placebo [6.1 Clinical Trials Experience]. This evidence suggests a potential correlation between niraparib and the onset of AKI. Additionally, abnormal laboratory findings included increased creatinine in 40% of ZEJULA-treated patients, which can be indicative of renal impairment [Table 5. Abnormal Laboratory Findings].

The NOVA trial results, which focused on recurrent gBRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, also documented acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction, with 12% incidence in patients treated with niraparib [6.1 Clinical Trials Experience].

Furthermore, post-marketing surveillance has identified AKI during the use of ZEJULA (niraparib), albeit without a frequency estimation or a firmly established causal relationship due to the nature of voluntary reporting [6.2 Postmarketing Experience].

In summary, both pooled clinical trials data and post-marketing surveillance suggest that acute kidney injury is a potential adverse reaction in patients exposed to niraparib (ZEJULA). Health care providers should monitor renal function in patients undergoing treatment with niraparib and manage their therapy accordingly. The sources of evidence are from the clinical trials PRIMA and NOVA as well as the post-marketing surveillance data, as detailed in the drug label provided.","In the sections provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury (AKI) is listed as an adverse reaction occurring in 13% of patients treated with niraparib in pooled safety populations (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) and in 12% of patients in the PRIMA study (Tables 4 and 6). This data from clinical trials suggests that AKI is indeed an adverse reaction associated with niraparib.

Therefore, based on the information given from the clinical trial experience with niraparib documented in the drug label, the statement requested – summarizing evidence refuting the relationship between AKI as an adverse reaction to niraparib – is not applicable, as the clinical trial data does indicate AKI as an observed adverse reaction with its use. 

NA"
acute kidney injury,nitrofurantoin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to nitrofurantoin is not explicitly stated in the provided drug label sections. The drug label emphasizes several adverse reactions and warnings associated with the use of nitrofurantoin, including gastrointestinal, neurologic, respiratory, hepatic, allergic, dermatologic, and hematologic events. However, it does not mention AKI directly within these sections.

Nitrofurantoin is known to cause several adverse reactions, but the incidence of clinically significant renal impairment is not highlighted in the label. Nevertheless, nitrofurantoin's association with peripheral neuropathy is flagged, with the risk being higher in patients with renal impairment. This suggests recognition of the drug's potential impact on renal function since a decrease in creatinine clearance is a marker for kidney function and a risk factor for neuropathy when taking nitrofurantoin.

It is important to note that while a drug label may not list a particular adverse event such as AKI, this does not mean that the event cannot occur. Cases of AKI associated with nitrofurantoin might still arise and be documented in clinical practice or post-marketing surveillance, warranting vigilance. Indeed, there have been reports in clinical literature of nitrofurantoin-induced AKI, commonly associated with allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). These are identified through case reports and limited studies and thus may not be robust enough to warrant inclusion in the main sections of the label at the time of your cutoff knowledge.

To further clarify the relationship between nitrofurantoin and AKI, a search in external databases like PubMed for clinical trials, case studies, and reviews on this specific adverse event would be necessary. If several well-documented cases and studies with a clear indication of causative link have been recorded, then one could argue for stronger evidence of this association.

In the absence of direct statements from the provided label sections and with knowledge cutoff up to 2023, we can conclude that the label does not list AKI as an adverse reaction, though other forms of renal concerns such as peripheral neuropathy associated with renal impairment are acknowledged. This underscores the need for healthcare professionals to remain vigilant and consider individual patient risk factors when prescribing nitrofurantoin, even if AKI is not a prominently listed adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,octreotide,,"The specific adverse reaction in question is acute kidney injury in relation to the use of octreotide, which is a somatostatin analog used primarily for the treatment of acromegaly, carcinoid tumors, and vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors.

Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing experience for octreotide. Here is a summary of the information related to adverse reactions and clinical trials:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
In the clinical studies presented, octreotide (specifically the formulation MYCAPSSA) has been evaluated in patients with acromegaly through a placebo-controlled study and an open-label baseline-controlled study. The adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 10% included nausea, diarrhea, headache, arthralgia, asthenia, hyperhidrosis, peripheral swelling, increased blood glucose, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, sinusitis, and osteoarthritis. However, acute kidney injury is not listed among the adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of ≥5% (Tables 1 and 2).

**Immunogenicity:**
No antibodies to the octreotide peptide from MYCAPSSA were detected in patients assessed throughout 13 months of treatment, thus not indicating an immunogenic cause of AKI.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
In the post-approval use of octreotide acetate, several adverse reactions have been voluntarily reported, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and renal problems. While ""renal failure"" and ""renal insufficiency"" are reported, the term ""acute kidney injury"" is not specifically listed. However, since both renal failure and renal insufficiency are conditions that may encompass acute kidney injury, this cannot be entirely ruled out as a potential adverse reaction.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
There is no explicit warning or precaution related to acute kidney injury with the use of octreotide in the sections provided. Other potential risks are outlined regarding gallbladder complications, glucose metabolism alterations, thyroid function abnormalities, cardiac function abnormalities, and vitamin B12 levels, none of which directly suggest a relationship with acute kidney injury.

In summary, there is no explicit evidence in the provided drug label sections from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that directly establishes a relationship between octreotide exposure and acute kidney injury. Nevertheless, the reports of ""renal failure"" and ""renal insufficiency"" in the postmarketing experience could represent a broader category that includes AKI but would require a detailed case-by-case evaluation to confirm a causal link.

It's important to note that limitations in voluntary reporting systems and the uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance can lead to underreporting or misattribution of adverse events. Therefore, if acute kidney injury is a concern with octreotide use, it would be prudent to explore literature databases and case reports for any additional evidence that may support this relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,oliceridine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for oliceridine (OLINVYK), there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a documented adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. The most common adverse drug reactions (≥10%) reported in controlled efficacy trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus, and hypoxia. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of oliceridine included hypotension, hypoxia, nausea, hypoventilation, decreased oxygen saturation, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, electrocardiogram QT prolongation, and urticaria.

The clinical trials described in the label (Study 1 and Study 2) for oliceridine related to orthopedic surgery-bunionectomy and plastic surgery-abdominoplasty used patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and reported adverse drug reactions that occurred in ≥5% of oliceridine-treated patients, stratified by total daily dose. Similarly, an open-label safety study (Study 3) reported adverse drug reactions stratified by total daily dose. None of these studies indicated AKI as a reported adverse reaction.

Furthermore, the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section lists other conditions associated with opioid use, such as serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, anaphylaxis, androgen deficiency, hyperalgesia and allodynia, and hypoglycemia. Again, AKI is not listed.

Therefore, based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance detailed in the drug label, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and oliceridine (OLINVYK) exposure. Health care professionals rely on additional sources, such as post-marketing reports, published literature, and pharmacovigilance databases, to identify potential adverse reactions not observed during clinical trials; yet, nothing is reported here regarding AKI. Clinicians monitor for adverse events not listed on the label and report them to drug regulatory authorities where they may be captured in post-marketing data if a pattern emerges over time.",NA
acute kidney injury,olmesartan,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and olmesartan exposure can be summarized based on information from post-marketing experience, as indicated in section 6.2 of the drug label. Acute renal failure is listed among the adverse reactions reported after olmesartan was marketed, based on voluntary reports from a population of unknown size.

While the drug label does not provide specific incidence rates or detailed studies on olmesartan-induced AKI, the association is recognized through these post-marketing reports. Since reporting of adverse reactions in the post-marketing phase is voluntary and the population size is uncertain, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of AKI or establish a definite causal relationship to olmesartan exposure. However, the inclusion of acute renal failure in the post-marketing experience suggests that there have been some observed cases where the link between olmesartan and AKI was suspected.

Furthermore, in section 5.4 of the drug label (Impaired Renal Function), there is a caution about the potential for changes in renal function due to the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by drugs like olmesartan, particularly in susceptible individuals or those with conditions where renal function may rely on this system, such as severe congestive heart failure. It hints that similar renal complications as seen with ACE inhibitors and other angiotensin receptor blockers, which have been associated with oliguria (decreased urine output), progressive azotemia (build-up of nitrogenous waste in the blood), and occasionally acute renal failure and death, could potentially occur with olmesartan treatment.

No specific clinical trials data are cited in the label regarding AKI as a recognized adverse effect from the controlled clinical trials of olmesartan. The label draws on the general safety evaluation of olmesartan in over 3825 patients/subjects and acknowledges that the rates observed in these studies cannot be directly compared to other drug studies or reflect the rates in the broader practice.

In conclusion, while post-marketing reports have signaled cases of AKI in patients taking olmesartan, and the drug label acknowledges the theoretical risk of renal impairment by this drug class, the available evidence from formal clinical studies on this specific adverse reaction is not explicitly detailed in the drug label. Therefore, while a potential relationship exists, the evidence is largely derived from voluntary post-marketing reports without specific data on incidence or causality from controlled clinical trials.",NA
acute kidney injury,oxacillin,,"Based on the provided sections of the oxacillin drug label, there is evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury can be an adverse reaction to the drug. The label explicitly mentions renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis as potential reactions associated with the administration of oxacillin. These manifestations may present with a variety of symptoms including rash, fever, eosinophilia, hematuria, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency. It is noted that nephropathy induced by penicillins, which includes oxacillin, does not appear to be dose-related and is typically reversible when the medication is promptly discontinued.

The evidence in the drug label indicates that these adverse reactions are recognized through post-marketing surveillance, as pharmacovigilance practices involve the monitoring of medications after they've been approved and introduced to the market to ensure continued safety among the general population. 

Post-marketing surveillance is critical for identifying less common adverse effects that may not have been detected during clinical trials. Clinical trials may not have large enough sample sizes or enough diversity to catch all potential side effects, especially those that are rare or that occur in subpopulations not well-represented in the trial. Furthermore, clinical trials are conducted under controlled conditions, whereas post-marketing surveillance can provide data from a real-world setting.

That said, the label does not provide specific incidences or detailed case reports, nor does it refer to specific clinical trials regarding acute kidney injury. For a more comprehensive understanding and additional evidence, one might need to look at medical literature, including case studies and reviews, to further establish and understand the incidence rate and mechanisms behind oxacillin-induced renal injuries.

In conclusion, evidence from post-marketing surveillance as noted in the oxacillin drug label suggests that acute kidney injury can occur as an adverse reaction to oxacillin. However, these reactions seem to be reversible upon the cessation of the medication. Additional resources such as clinical trials, case studies, and reviews would be needed to provide a complete picture of the incidence and the mechanisms of oxacillin-induced acute kidney injury.

To report suspected adverse reactions, the drug label also instructs to contact the FDA, indicating the procedure for ongoing monitoring and data collection regarding adverse effects of medications, including oxacillin.","NA

The provided drug label sections of oxacillin clearly indicate that acute kidney injury in the form of renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis has been associated with the administration of oxacillin. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to oxacillin, as the adverse reaction is acknowledged in the drug's labeling."
acute kidney injury,oxaliplatin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to oxaliplatin is not explicitly mentioned in the provided drug label sections 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS and 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS of oxaliplatin. The adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings focus on different sets of issues such as hypersensitivity reactions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, myelosuppression, pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, QT interval prolongation, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhage, and embryo-fetal toxicity. 

In the listed clinical trials experience (section 6.1), acute kidney injury is also not reported as a common adverse reaction. Hematological complications like neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; gastrointestinal events like nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting; increased transaminases and alkaline phosphatase; and sensory neuropathy were among the most common adverse reactions.

The postmarketing experience section (6.2) does identify acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure as adverse reactions reported during the post-approval use of oxaliplatin. However, the frequency and causal relationship to drug exposure are not clearly established due to their voluntary nature of reporting and the uncertain size of the population.

In summary, based on the provided sections of the drug label, evidence directly linking acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to oxaliplatin in clinical trials is not mentioned. References to kidney-related issues appear in the postmarketing experience section and include acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure, but these are not quantified or directly connected as common reactions to the drug within the data from clinical trials. If AKI is a concern when using oxaliplatin, careful monitoring of renal function is suggested, considering the reports of renal adverse reactions in the postmarketing period.

For a more definitive assessment, consultation with scientific literature outside the drug label, specifically research studies or case reports on the link between oxaliplatin and AKI, would be beneficial. Since the provided drug label does not contain such evidence, it is beyond the information given to link AKI firmly as an adverse reaction to oxaliplatin.",NA
acute kidney injury,oxaprozin,1.0,"Based on the available information from the drug label of oxaprozin, here is a concise summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction and exposure to oxaprozin:

Clinical Trials Experience:
The adverse reaction data from clinical trials suggest that oxaprozin has been associated with various adverse events affecting the urogenital system. Although acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned, abnormal renal function is noted as an adverse reaction occurring at an incidence greater than 1% in patients who took 1200 mg to 1800 mg of oxaprozin per day in clinical trials (Section 6.1). Given that oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and this class of drugs is known for its potential to cause renal adverse effects, the mention of abnormal renal function is clinically relevant.

Postmarketing Experience:
In the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and acute renal failure have been identified as adverse reactions during the post-approval use of oxaprozin. Although there are no direct statistics provided regarding the frequency, this postmarketing surveillance does establish a link between oxaprozin exposure and acute kidney injury.

Warnings and Precautions:
The label also warns of the risk of renal toxicity (Section 5.6). It acknowledges that NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can lead to renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury, particularly in patients with preexisting renal disease, or those who are at risk due to conditions such as heart failure, liver dysfunction, or dehydration. It advises caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia and recommends monitoring renal function in specific patient cohorts. This section supports the concept that oxaprozin can pose a risk for acute kidney injury in vulnerable populations.

In summary, evidence from clinical trial data, postmarketing reports, and specific warnings in the label supports the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to oxaprozin. These findings are consistent with the known risks associated with NSAID use and underscore the importance of monitoring renal function when prescribing oxaprozin, particularly in patients with risk factors for renal impairment.","Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to support the relationship between acute kidney injury and oxaprozin use. In the Warnings and Precautions section (5.6), it is noted that long-term administration of NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can result in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. It also states that renal toxicity has been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins play a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. Further, it advises caution and monitoring of renal function in patients with renal impairment, heart failure, dehydration, hypovolemia, and those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, as well as in the elderly.

Moreover, the label indicates that oxaprozin should be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia, which can be associated with renal dysfunction, is also listed as a potential concern with oxaprozin use.

Given this information from the drug label, there is no evidence to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to oxaprozin; in fact, the label highlights renal toxicity as a risk associated with its use.

Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that acute kidney injury is not an adverse reaction of oxaprozin, as the evidence provided in the drug label itself suggests otherwise. NA (not applicable) is not the appropriate response in this case since there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and oxaprozin.
"
acute kidney injury,oxycodone,,"The information provided from the drug label for Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution does not explicitly list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an identified adverse reaction in the sections for adverse reactions or warnings. The sections you have provided extensively detail a variety of possible adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with oxycodone use, such as addiction, abuse, misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, as well as other serious and common adverse reactions.

While acute kidney injury is not mentioned among the listed adverse reactions or warnings, this does not mean that AKI has not been reported or could not be a potential but rare side effect of oxycodone or other opioid analgesics. It is possible for adverse events to occur outside of those observed in clinical trials or not be recognized until the post-marketing phase.

For an accurate and specific assessment concerning acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to oxycodone, additional peer-reviewed evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance would need to be reviewed. Since the information was not present in the provided drug label sections, and without further external data, we cannot conclusively state that there is a known, documented relationship between AKI and oxycodone exposure based on the available information.

It is also important to note that acute kidney injury can occur due to a multitude of factors which may include dehydration, hypotension, and concomitant use of medications that impact renal function. As such, if oxycodone use contributes to such conditions (for example, through severe hypotension), it might indirectly increase the risk of AKI.

In the absence of additional scientific data and reports, we cannot provide a summary of evidence for AKI as an adverse reaction to oxycodone. It is recommended to consult a healthcare provider for clinical assessment and to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate drug safety authorities, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, for monitoring and investigation.",NA
acute kidney injury,paclitaxel,,"Based on the extensive information provided, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to paclitaxel in the clinical trials, adverse reaction sections, warnings, or post-marketing experience as described in the drug label sections provided. The common adverse reactions of paclitaxel reported in the various clinical studies included hematologic effects like neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; non-hematologic effects such as sensory neuropathy, alopecia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea), and others.

The relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure typically requires specific mention in either case reports, clinical trial data, or post-marketing surveillance if it is to be considered an established adverse effect. Since the information supplied does not indicate that acute kidney injury has been observed or reported in association with paclitaxel, we can conclude that there is no known evidence supporting this relationship in the provided label sections.

However, it should be noted that the absence of AKI in the provided sections does not rule out its occurrence entirely. Renal function assessments are routinely part of the safety evaluations in clinical trials; nevertheless, AKI might still emerge as a recognized effect only through broader or longer-term post-marketing surveillance, or if new evidence comes to light.

In clinical practice, any suspected adverse reactions such as acute kidney injury related to paclitaxel would be reported to pharmacovigilance programs like FDA MedWatch for further investigation. It's essential to review updated medical literature and drug databases for the most current information regarding drug safety and to report any suspected new adverse reactions to health authorities for ongoing pharmacovigilance efforts.","NA
"
acute kidney injury,panitumumab,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for panitumumab (Vectibix), there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure when panitumumab is used in combination with chemotherapy. Here is a summary of the relevant evidence:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   In the Warnings and Precautions section (5.5) of the drug label, it is noted that severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the label does not provide specific incidence rates or details for these observations. The lack of quantitative data on acute kidney injury in the clinical trials section suggests it may not have been a common or well-characterized adverse event during the clinical trials. 

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   No direct mention is made of acute kidney injury or renal failure in the postmarketing experience section (6.3), suggesting that this adverse reaction may not have been reported frequently in the postmarketing setting, or that it may not have been recognized as a reaction specifically attributable to Vectibix outside of the combination with chemotherapy.

3. Adverse Reactions:
   While the provided label sections mention acute renal failure in combination with chemotherapy in the warnings section, the list of adverse reactions (6.1) that occurred in clinical trials of Vectibix (either as monotherapy or in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy) does not include acute kidney injury as a categorized adverse reaction.

In summary, the relationship between acute kidney injury and panitumumab exposure is mentioned in the context of combination therapy with chemotherapy, suggesting a potential link when used in this manner. This evidence comes from the drug label's warnings with no specific details or incidence rates provided. It is important to note that drug labels and warnings consider the totality of evidence, including but not limited to clinical trial data, postmarketing reports, and the scientific literature. The absence of detailed evidence in other sections implies that acute kidney injury might not be a prominent adverse reaction when panitumumab is used as monotherapy or that it was not as extensively characterized in the clinical trial data as other adverse reactions. Clinicians should be vigilant and monitor kidney function when prescribing Vectibix, particularly in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, as is recommended in the labeling.",NA
acute kidney injury,panobinostat,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for panobinostat, marketed as FARYDAK, there is evidence that this medication may cause renal-related adverse reactions. Specifically, the section pertaining to adverse reactions and treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities includes an increase in blood creatinine and reports of renal failure.

From the ""Clinical Trials Experience"" (6.1) within the safety data, it is noted that treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities included blood creatinine increased in 41% of patients in the FARYDAK arm, with around 12% experiencing Grade 3/4 elevations, indicating a serious impact on renal function. Furthermore, the ""Other Adverse Reactions"" section of the clinical trials experience of patients treated with FARYDAK describes renal failure without specifying the frequency, implying that this adverse reaction was less common but still observed.

Since increased creatinine levels and renal failure are indicative of possible acute kidney injury (AKI), the label information hints at a relationship between panobinostat (FARYDAK) administration and renal adverse effects, including AKI. However, the label does not specify the incidence of explicitly diagnosed acute kidney injury beyond the reported laboratory changes and named renal failure events.

The detailed information about the frequency and severity of elevated blood creatinine levels and renal failure, along with the clinical trial context—such as the population studied and the conditions of the trial—allow healthcare providers to consider the risks of AKI when prescribing FARYDAK and to monitor appropriately for this potential adverse reaction.

To further evaluate the relationship between acute kidney injury and panobinostat exposure, a review of post-marketing surveillance data, additional clinical trials, case studies, and other scientific literature beyond the drug label content might be necessary. It is important to note that while the provided drug label information suggests an association between panobinostat use and potential renal adverse effects, the label does not offer a detailed assessment of causality or incidence rates for acute kidney injury specifically.",NA
acute kidney injury,parathyroid hormone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for parathyroid hormone (NATPARA), there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial setting, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance.

The adverse reactions related to NATPARA (parathyroid hormone) that are reported in the clinical trial encompass hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hypersensitivity, paresthesia, headache, nausea, hypoesthesia, diarrhea, vomiting, arthralgia, hypercalciuria, and pain in the extremity. In the section detailing the clinical trial (6.1), there is mention of monitoring the renal function through estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which suggests a consideration of renal impact, but no specific incidence of acute kidney injury is noted.

Post-marketing experiences detailed in the provided sections (6.3) also do not report acute kidney injury as a known adverse effect. Instead, they include hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash, as well as seizures due to hypocalcemia.

In conclusion, the supporting evidence from the clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance provided in the drug label does not explicitly report acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction from the use of NATPARA. It is important to consider that the absence of this specific information in the provided sections does not definitively rule out the possibility, but rather it has not been reported as an outcome in the clinical trial data or observed in post-marketing experience thus far, as per the available information. It is always important to monitor patients for any side effects, including those affecting the kidney, when they are receiving any medication.",NA
acute kidney injury,paricalcitol,,"In the provided drug label sections for paricalcitol, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing experience detailed for this drug. Paricalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D analog used to treat and prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism (excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in stages 3, 4, and 5.

However, it is mentioned under 'Warnings and Precautions' and in the 'Laboratory Tests' subsection that paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine, which could indicate a decline in kidney function or potentially kidney injury, though this information does not confirm AKI directly. Serum creatinine is a common laboratory marker used to estimate kidney function, and increasing levels may be a sign of deteriorating kidney function or AKI.

The evidence from the clinical trials provided lists various adverse reactions with their respective frequencies but does not explicitly include AKI. The most common adverse reactions reported were diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitivity, nausea, and edema, among others. It is important to note that this label information specifies that these reported adverse events cannot be directly linked to drug exposure due to the differing conditions under which clinical studies are conducted.

In the 'Postmarketing Experience' section, an adverse reaction of 'blood creatinine increased' is noted, which could potentially indicate cases of AKI. However, the label emphasizes that it is difficult to reliably estimate the frequency of such reactions or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary nature of these reports.

In summary, the provided sections of the paricalcitol drug label do not offer direct evidence or specific case details indicating that acute kidney injury is a known adverse reaction to the drug. While there is a mention of increased serum creatinine, which could be related to renal function decline, this information is not sufficient to establish a definitive causal relationship between AKI and paricalcitol exposure.

Professional consultation with a healthcare provider or further investigation into the scientific literature may provide additional insights or updated evidence regarding this potential adverse reaction. It would be beneficial to review the broader body of scientific and medical literature, including case reports and epidemiological studies, for any documented instances of AKI in patients taking paricalcitol that may have arisen after the drug label information was published.",NA
acute kidney injury,paroxetine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for Paroxetine, there is no mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the context of the listed clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The detailed labels primarily discuss other adverse reactions and side effects associated with Paroxetine exposure, such as gastrointestinal issues (nausea, constipation), CNS-related symptoms (somnolence, dizziness, insomnia), sexual dysfunction, and at times weight loss, without explicit reference to AKI.

A thorough assessment of the listed events under the ""Adverse Reactions,"" ""Warnings,"" and ""Postmarketing Reports"" sections does not reveal acute kidney injury as a reported outcome.

However, it is important to note that this does not rule out the possibility of AKI as an extremely rare and undocumented adverse reaction to Paroxetine. Pharmacovigilance mechanisms are designed to continuously monitor for new and unexpected side effects, so health professionals are encouraged to report such findings to drug safety authorities.

In summary, based on the information provided, there is no known evidence from the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance presented in the Paroxetine drug label that supports AKI as an adverse reaction to Paroxetine.",NA
acute kidney injury,pegcetacoplan,,"Based on the provided drug label information for pegcetacoplan (EMPAVELI), the evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure is seen during the post-randomized control period of the clinical trial Study APL2-302. This study included adult patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), where acute kidney injury was reported as an adverse reaction occurring in 5% of patients treated with EMPAVELI during the open-label part of the study. This finding indicates a potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury in association with EMPAVELI treatment in this patient population.

It should be noted that adverse reactions of medications are typically understood in the context of clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. The overall safety profile of a drug is constructed from the totality of reported adverse events among participants in clinical trials, alongside observational data once the drug is available to the broader population.

In the clinical trial data provided for EMPAVELI, acute kidney injury is specifically listed as an adverse event observed in a known percentage of patients (5%) during the extended treatment phase (up to 48 weeks) of the clinical trial. This evidence suggests a temporal relationship with EMPAVELI treatment within the context of the trial. However, the information provided does not include details on causality, underlying mechanisms, or risk factors that might contribute to the incidence of acute kidney injury in these patients.

No further details are evident from the provided sections regarding additional case studies or post-marketing surveillance specifically for acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to pegcetacoplan. To thoroughly evaluate the relationship and the level of evidence, it would be valuable to have access to comprehensive pharmacovigilance data, including the complete clinical study reports, post-marketing surveillance data, case reports, and a better understanding of the patient populations and their respective susceptibilities.

In summary, according to the evidence from clinical trial Study APL2-302, acute kidney injury has been reported as an adverse reaction in a small proportion of patients treated with pegcetacoplan. However, this information alone does not establish a causal relationship and should be interpreted along with additional data from broader clinical use and post-marketing monitoring for a more robust assessment of the risk.",NA
acute kidney injury,pemetrexed,,"Evidence for acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of pemetrexed comes from clinical trials as well as post-marketing surveillance. 

Clinical Trials:
In the KEYNOTE-189 clinical trial, which was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pemetrexed was administered in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy. Of the patients who received this combination, 3% discontinued treatment due to acute kidney injury.

Another study cited is Study JMDB, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC where patients received pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin. In this particular study, 1% of patients experienced elevated creatinine, and the data also indicate that other renal adverse events such as renal failure were reported.

An additional cited clinical trial, Study JMCH, evaluated pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Here, the incidence of renal toxicity including elevated creatinine was 2.2%.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Cases of severe, and sometimes fatal, renal failure have been reported in the post-marketing setting. Although the rates and incidence are not provided, these voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size are indicative of AKI being a potential adverse reaction associated with pemetrexed use.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label specifically mentions under ""Warnings and Precautions"" that pemetrexed can cause severe renal toxicity, including AKI. It advises against administration of pemetrexed when creatinine clearance is less than 45 mL/min, suggesting a known relationship between pemetrexed and renal impairment.

In summary, the evidence points towards a relationship between pemetrexed exposure and acute kidney injury, with clear references from clinical trials including KEYNOTE-189, JMDB, and JMCH. Additionally, post-marketing adverse event reports and explicit warnings in the prescribing information corroborate this adverse reaction. It is essential for healthcare providers to closely monitor renal function in patients being treated with pemetrexed and to take appropriate actions per the label's recommendations to mitigate the risk.",NA
acute kidney injury,pemigatinib,,"Based on the drug label sections provided for pemigatinib (trade name PEMAZYRE), there is evidence to support the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the use of pemigatinib, as reported in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Key details from these sources are as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Evidence:
    - The safety profile of pemigatinib was assessed in two clinical trials, FIGHT-202 and FIGHT-203, which included patients with previously treated, advanced, or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and those with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangement, respectively.
    - In the FIGHT-202 trial, serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving pemigatinib, and acute kidney injury was reported as a serious adverse reaction in ≥2% of patients. Additionally, pemigatinib treatment was permanently discontinued due to acute kidney injury in ≥1% of patients.
    - In the FIGHT-203 trial, serious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of patients receiving pemigatinib at all dosages, and AKI was reported in >5% of patients. Furthermore, fatal adverse reactions in this trial included acute kidney injury.
    - Laboratory abnormalities reported in both trials included increased creatinine levels, which can indicate impairment of kidney function.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
    - No specific data from post-marketing surveillance was provided in the text, but users are directed to report suspected adverse reactions to Incyte Corporation or the FDA, indicating that post-marketing surveillance is an ongoing process for gathering additional safety data.

Based on this evidence, it is clear that acute kidney injury is a documented adverse reaction associated with pemigitinib treatment. However, it is important to consider the clinical context, including patient comorbidities and the severity of underlying disease, when interpreting these findings. Healthcare providers should monitor renal function in patients receiving pemigatinib and consider dose modification or discontinuation as recommended if AKI or significant increases in serum creatinine occur.

Source: Relevant sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) from the drug label for pemigatinib.",NA
acute kidney injury,penicillamine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, there is evidence suggesting that exposure to penicillamine can lead to various adverse reactions affecting multiple organ systems. Regarding acute kidney injury (AKI), the label explicitly mentions renal complications as a potential adverse effect of penicillamine therapy.

Here's a summary of the evidence related to AKI:

1. **Clinical Trials:** The drug label references an incidence of proteinuria (6%) in patients treated with penicillamine, based on data from 17 clinical trials involving 1270 rheumatoid arthritis patients. Proteinuria can be a marker of kidney injury, and its presence suggests possible renal involvement.

2. **Case Reports and Observations:** Although not specifically denoted as ""acute kidney injury"" in the abstract, renal failure is mentioned as an adverse event that has been reported. This points toward instances of severe kidney damage, which may include AKI.

3. **Pathophysiology Evidence:** The label indicates an immunological reaction with the development of immune complex membranous glomerulopathy, a condition known to affect the kidneys, possibly leading to nephrotic syndrome and, consequently, AKI.

4. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:** While the drug label does not provide details from post-marketing surveillance data regarding AKI as an adverse event, the mention of renal failure implies that such cases may have been identified following the widespread use of the drug after its initial clinical trials.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials, pathophysiological insights, and, indirectly, post-marketing surveillance indicates that penicillamine is associated with renal complications that can manifest as proteinuria and potentially lead to acute kidney injury. However, to determine the precise incidence and causal relationship of AKI due to penicillamine, more detailed post-marketing surveillance data, well-documented case studies, or targeted research would be beneficial.","The provided drug label sections on penicillamine adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings do not mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. It mentions proteinuria, hematuria, and the potential development of nephrotic syndrome due to immune complex membranous glomerulopathy. Renal failure has also been reported as an adverse reaction. These renal issues are different and distinct from acute kidney injury in terms of pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

However, unless there are specifically designed studies or case reports that refute the relationship of AKI to penicillamine, it is not possible to conclusively state that there is evidence refuting the occurrence of acute kidney injury as a result of penicillamine exposure. The absence of mention in the drug label suggests that AKI may not be a recognized common adverse reaction, but it does not equate to evidence refuting the occurrence.

Therefore, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence indicating that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction to penicillamine, but there is also no evidence refuting the possibility. Further investigation such as a literature review or additional clinical data would be needed to make a definitive statement. Without such data, it is not appropriate to conclude that there is evidence refuting the relationship between AKI and penicillamine exposure."
acute kidney injury,pentamidine,,"Evidence from the drug label for pentamidine isethionate indicates that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a recognized adverse reaction associated with its use. The label explicitly mentions kidney-related adverse events reported in clinical trials, which include increased creatinine levels, impaired renal function, azotemia, and renal failure. Moreover, it states that these nephrotoxic events are considered common with the parenteral (intramuscular and intravenous) administration of the drug. 

The provided information quantifies the observed frequency of kidney-related adverse reactions in a sample size of 424 patients. Specifically, the adverse reactions included elevated serum creatinine (23.6%), elevated blood urea nitrogen (6.6%), and an overall impaired renal function rate of 28.8%. 

These adverse events were reported regardless of their causal relationship to pentamidine isethionate therapy, with the label cautioning that the drug's administration should be limited to patients where Pneumocystis carinii has been demonstrated due to the risk profile.

From post-marketing surveillance, additional kidney-related adverse events such as renal dysfunction and renal failure have been reported, although they do not provide specific frequencies. Post-marketing reports come from a broader patient population and real-world usage, thus complementing data from controlled clinical trial settings.

In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to pentamidine isethionate is based on data obtained from controlled clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as documented in the drug label provided by XGen Pharmaceuticals DJB, Inc. These data indicate a relatively high frequency of AKI and other nephrotoxic effects, prompting the label to advise caution in administering the drug due to the risk of serious renal adverse events.",NA
acute kidney injury,pentostatin,,"Acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to pentostatin (NIPENT) is not explicitly detailed in the sections provided from the drug label. However, there is mention of kidney-related adverse events that have been observed in clinical settings and post-marketing experience. Here's a summary of the evidence related to renal effects from the provided data:

Clinical Trials: In the drug label sections provided, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse event observed during the clinical trials. However, under the Laboratory Deviations subsection, ""Elevated Creatinine"" is listed as an adverse event that occurred in 3% to 10% of NIPENT-treated patients in the initial phase of the SWOG study. Elevated blood creatinine levels may be indicative of impaired kidney function, but it is not specified whether this represented acute kidney injury or a less severe form of renal impairment.

Adverse Events: Under the section detailing adverse events occurring in less than 3% of NIPENT-treated patients, ""Renal Failure, Renal Insufficiency, Renal Stone"" were listed, which can be related to serious kidney issues but do not specify the timing or acuteness of these renal events.

Post-marketing Surveillance: The label mentions ""Kidney Function Abnormal, Nephropathy, Renal Failure, Renal Insufficiency"" as adverse events identified during the post-approval use of NIPENT. While these terms cover a range of kidney-related issues, they do not conclusively establish acute kidney injury. Still, the inclusion of ""Renal Failure"" could potentially encompass acute kidney injury cases.

The drug label warnings advise against using higher doses than recommended due to dose-limiting severe renal (along with liver, pulmonary, and CNS) toxicities observed in Phase 1 studies at higher doses. This supports the assertion that pentostatin has the potential to cause severe renal adverse effects, possibly including acute kidney injury, especially at higher dosages.

Given the information provided, while there is no direct evidence from clinical trials explicitly linking pentostatin to acute kidney injury, there is suggestive evidence of renal toxicity associated with pentostatin use, including kidney function abnormalities and renal failure. It is important for clinicians to monitor renal function in patients receiving pentostatin and for patients to be aware of potential kidney-related side effects. Further detailed investigation or specific studies focused on acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction to pentostatin would be necessary to conclusively establish this relationship.","The provided drug label for NIPENT (pentostatin) does not include acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse event explicitly related to the drug. No evidence is presented in the clinical trials or postmarketing experience sections that refutes or establishes a causal relationship between pentostatin and acute kidney injury.

The label lists various adverse reactions and laboratory deviations, some related to the kidney such as elevated creatinine, kidney function abnormal, nephropathy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, and renal stone, but it does not specifically mention acute kidney injury. Furthermore, under the ""Hematologic System"" heading in the postmarketing experience, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, which can involve acute kidney failure, is mentioned. However, the frequency or clear causative link with pentostatin use is not established due to the nature of voluntary reporting from postmarketing surveillance.

In conclusion, there is no explicit evidence in the drug label provided that refutes a relationship between pentostatin and acute kidney injury. To definitively rule out any potential association, further research and more detailed analysis of clinical and post-market data would be necessary. If such analyses exist, they are not included in the provided drug label information."
acute kidney injury,perindopril,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to perindopril is outlined in the drug's label, particularly under the Warnings and Precautions (5.5) section. Perindopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor commonly prescribed for hypertension and stable coronary artery disease (CAD).

Clinical trials: In clinical trials, perindopril has been associated with impaired renal function; however, specific data on acute kidney injury in relation to perindopril was not provided in the adverse reactions (6.1) and clinical laboratory findings (6.3) sections of the drug label. Instead, it is mentioned that some perindopril-treated patients have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, particularly when concomitantly treated with diuretics (5.5). These changes may indicate potential renal function impairment, which can range from mild dysfunction to acute kidney injury.

Impaired renal function warning: Section 5.5 of the drug label explicitly states that as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals and that renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving perindopril. This implies that the drug has recognized effects on renal physiology, potentially leading to AKI in susceptible patients, such as those with severe congestive heart failure or with existing renal artery stenosis.

Postmarketing experience: According to section 6.2 of the drug label, cases of ""acute renal failure"" have been reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and are of unknown causal relationship to perindopril. Although not specifically labeled as acute kidney injury, acute renal failure represents a severe form of AKI, strengthening the evidence for the potential risk of this adverse reaction during perindropil treatment.

Overall, the evidence suggesting a relationship between AKI and perindopril is derived mainly from warnings regarding impaired renal function in susceptible individuals and from postmarketing reports of acute renal failure. While specific incidences from clinical trials are not detailed in the provided label sections, the explicit warnings and postmarketing experiences contribute to a cautious association between perindopril exposure and the potential for acute kidney injury. Regular monitoring of renal function is recommended when prescribing perindopril, especially in high-risk patient populations.","NA

The provided label sections and warnings do not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to perindopril. Instead, under ""Impaired Renal Function"" (5.5), it is acknowledged that ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, can affect renal function, particularly in individuals with conditions where renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. There is also mention of the possibility of acute renal failure and death in patients with severe congestive heart failure, as well as in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. However, no specific evidence is provided that directly refutes the potential for acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to perindopril."
acute kidney injury,pertuzumab,,"The drug label information provided does not contain any direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction or complication in the context of pertuzumab (PERJETA) treatment in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance.

From the detailed sections on adverse reactions encountered in clinical trials for the use of pertuzumab in various breast cancer treatment settings, including metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA), neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer (NeoSphere, TRYPHAENA, BERENICE), and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (APHINITY), the listed common adverse reactions (> 30%) and Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) do not mention acute kidney injury.

Similarly, under the post-marketing experience, the label references tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which can include acute renal failure but is not specifically highlighted as acute kidney injury. TLS is considered a potential complication in patients with significant tumor burden and is not directly attributed as a common adverse reaction to pertuzumab.

Warnings and precautions, including a boxed warning, focus primarily on left ventricular dysfunction, embryo-fetal toxicity, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Again, acute kidney injury is not listed as a concern in these sections.

Immunogenicity and infusion-related reactions have been reported, but there is no indication that these led to incidents of acute kidney occasions.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label information for pertuzumab, there is no explicit evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury is a reported adverse reaction associated with its use. If real-world data or case reports emerge in the literature that indicate otherwise, it may not have been reflected in the labeling text at the time of the provided documentation. It would be advisable to conduct a thorough literature review or check the most recent label and post-marketing surveillance data for any updates on this issue.",NA
acute kidney injury,pertuzumab,,"No evidence is available in the provided label sections that directly associates acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to pertuzumab. Pertuzumab, sold under the brand name PERJETA, is used in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for treating HER2-positive breast cancer in various contexts (e.g., metastatic breast cancer, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment).

The label sections detail the most common adverse reactions and serious warnings and precautions for pertuzumab. Adverse reactions commonly seen with pertuzamab included diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting. In addition, it speaks to potentially serious side effects such as left ventricular dysfunction, embryo-fetal toxicity, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions/anaphylaxis.

However, acute kidney injury is not mentioned in the adverse reactions in any section of the clinical trials (CLEOPATRA, NeoSphere, TRYPHAENA, BERENICE, APHINITY) or the post-marketing experience for pertuzumab. The warnings and precautions focus on cardiac dysfunction and embryo-fetal toxicity, along with infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions.

The post-marketing experience mentions tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which can sometimes be associated with acute renal failure, but it does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction.

In conclusion, based on the information provided from the clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and drug label warnings, there is no known evidence supporting a direct relationship between acute kidney injury and pertuzumab exposure.",NA
acute kidney injury,piroxicam,1.0,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to piroxicam is supported by evidence presented in Section 5.6 (Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia) of the drug labeling. This section highlights that long-term administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include piroxicam, can result in adverse renal effects such as renal papillary necrosis and other renal injuries. Specifically, the drug labeling mentions that renal toxicity has been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins play a compensatory role in maintaining renal perfusion. This implies that in these patients, administration of piroxicam may lead to a reduction in prostaglandin formation and subsequent reduction in renal blood flow, potentially precipitating overt renal decompensation, which could manifest as acute kidney injury.

Furthermore, patients at the greatest risk of experiencing renal adverse reactions, which would include AKIR, are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, as well as elderly patients. The recommendations in this section urge monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment or risk factors and avoiding the use of piroxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks.

While specific incidence rates or direct causality data are not detailed in the provided label sections, the information given under 'Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia' makes it clear that medical professionals and patients should be aware of the potential for NSAIDs, including piroxicam, to cause renal adverse effects such as AKI under certain conditions or in at-risk populations.

No direct references to clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data regarding AKI specifically related to piroxicam usage are provided in the sections quoted above. However, given the general warning about renal toxicity with NSAID use and the mechanisms described, there appears to be a plausible association between piroxicam intake and the potential for acute kidney injury, based on the effects observed in patients with conditions affecting renal prostaglandins.

Monitoring and caution are advised when prescribing piroxicam, especially to high-risk populations, to prevent or mitigate the risk of AKI developing as an adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,plazomicin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for plazomicin (ZEMDRI), there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and plazomicin exposure. This evidence comes from clinical trials, specifically mentioned in these sections, which report on nephrotoxicity related to the drug.

In the clinical trials referenced (Trial 1, NCT02486627 and Trial 2, NCT01096849) conducted in patients with complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, the following relevant details were provided:

- Acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine increased, and other kidney-related issues were a part of the adverse reactions reported in Trial 1, with a 3.6% incidence in patients treated with plazomicin (11/303) compared to 1.3% in those treated with meropenem (4/301). 
- Serum creatinine increases of 0.5 mg/dL or greater above baseline were observed in 7% of ZEMDRI-treated patients (21/300) versus 4% in meropenem-treated patients (12/297). These numbers were higher in patients with baseline creatinine clearance (CLcr) of ≥30 and ≤90 mL/min, where the rate was 9.7% in ZEMDRI-treated compared to 4.1% in meropenem-treated patients.
- An association between plazomicin trough levels (Cmin) greater than or equal to 3 mcg/mL and AKI was observed.
- The majority of patients with creatinine increases during IV therapy had recovered renal function by the last follow-up visit.

The label also carries a boxed warning stating that ""Nephrotoxicity has been reported with ZEMDRI."" It highlights that the risk of nephrotoxicity is higher in patients with already impaired renal function, the elderly, and those on concomitant nephrotoxic medications.

Furthermore, these trials advised for creatinine clearance assessment in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during treatment with ZEMDRI, particularly for those at an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. 

These findings are supported by the well-established nephrotoxicity risk associated with aminoglycoside antibiotics, which plazomicin belongs to. The evidence clearly associates plazomicin exposure with an increased risk of AKI, with the clinical trials cited above providing direct data on incidences of renal function decline among patients treated with the drug.

Therefore, the evidence from clinical trials indicates a clear relationship between acute kidney injury and plazomicin exposure. The details provided in the drug label's adverse reaction sections, including nephrotoxicity warnings, support this relationship.","NA

The provided drug label sections indicate that acute kidney injury (nephrotoxicity) is an observed adverse reaction associated with plazomicin (ZEMDRI). Evidence from clinical trials demonstrates an incidence of adverse reactions associated with renal function such as serum creatinine increases and acute kidney injury. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and plazomicin exposure; instead, the evidence supports this relationship."
acute kidney injury,polatuzumab vedotin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for polatuzumab vedotin, acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The safety profile discussed in the label includes a range of other adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, but AKI or renal insufficiency is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction or a warning/precaution of major concern.

The most frequent adverse reactions listed for patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin in combination with other chemotherapy agents (e.g., R-CHP or bendamustine and a rituximab product) include peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, decreased appetite, pneumonia, and infusion-related reactions. The label also discusses serious adverse reactions such as infections and myelosuppression. In the provided clinical trial data, increased creatinine, which could be an indirect indicator of renal impairment, is mentioned as an observed laboratory abnormality but with a very low incidence of grade 3-4 severity that was not markedly different between treatment and comparator arms.

It is worth noting that other sections of the drug label that could contain information regarding AKI, such as the renal disorders subsection under clinical trial adverse reactions, suggest that renal insufficiency has been reported in a small subset of patients, although this appears to be less than 10% and is not detailed further.

In conclusion, according to the provided information, there is no direct evidence in the drug label that acute kidney injury is a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to polatuzumab vedotin. The label instead focuses on other hematologic and non-hematologic adverse reactions, along with myelosuppression and infection risks. If concerns about AKI and polatuzumab vedotin exist, further investigation into more detailed safety data, such as full clinical study reports or pharmacovigilance databases, would be required to determine the prevalence and possible causal relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,pomalidomide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to pomalidomide comes from both clinical trials and postmarketing experiences, as detailed in the provided drug label sections.

From the information on clinical trials, acute kidney injury was shown to be an adverse reaction in patients treated with pomalidomide. In the table summarizing adverse reactions from Trial 1, renal failure (which often encompasses acute kidney injury) was reported in 16 (15%) of patients treated with pomalidomide alone and in 11 (10%) of patients treated with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. Grade 3 or 4 renal failure was noted in 9 (8%) of the pomalidomide alone treated patients and in 8 (7%) of the combination therapy patients.

Similarly, the data from Trial 2 reported renal failure as an adverse reaction, occurring in 19 (6%) of patients treated with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and in 8 (5%) treated with high-dose dexamethasone respectively. Additionally, increased blood creatinine levels, which could indicate compromised kidney function, were reported in both trials.

Furthermore, under the section listing ""Renal and urinary disorders"" in the summary of adverse reactions in patients treated with POMALYST for Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) in Trial 12-C-0047, elevated creatinine was noted in 86% of patients with a Grade 3 or 4 elevation in 3.6%. Acute kidney injury may be present within this context.

It is also important to note that the postmarketing experience section lists renal failure, but does not provide specific frequencies or incidences of acute kidney injury outside of controlled trials.

In conclusion, there is evidence from both clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance that suggests acute kidney strategy as a potential adverse reaction to pomalidomide. The drug label provides this information, showing occurrences of renal failure and increased creatinine levels among patients who received the drug during clinical studies and in the wider market. The information was presented separately for multiple myeloma and KS patients, revealing a quantitative relationship between pomalidomide exposure and kidney-related adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,pomalidomide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and pomalidomide exposure primarily comes from clinical trials and postmarketing experience. Here is a concise summary:

Clinical Trials:
In the safety and adverse reaction data from clinical trials for Pomalidomide, renal failure is mentioned. Specifically:

- In Trial 2, renal failure was reported in approximately 10% of patients in the Pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex arm and about 18% in the high-dose dexamethasone arm, with Grade 3 or 4 renal failure occurring in 6% of the Pomalidomide + Low-dose Dex group. This suggests a higher incidence rate compared to high-dose dexamethasone even though there were more Grade 3/4 events with the latter.
- In Trial 12-C-0047 for Kaposi Sarcoma (KS), increased creatinine levels were seen in 86% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 in 3.6%, indicating a substantial number of patients experiencing some form of renal impairment.

These trials indicate that renal impairment, including acute kidney injury, can be associated with pomalidomide treatment.

Postmarketing Experience:
In the postmarketing experience section, there is a report of renal and urinary disorders, which include acute renal failure, although the incidence rate is not specified. This adds to the evidence from clinical trials and suggests that the risk of renal failure does not only apply to the clinical trial setting but has been observed in a broader patient population after the drug has been approved and is in wider use.

Based on the available evidence, acute kidney examination is reported as an adverse reaction in clinical trials and has been observed in patients following the market release of pomalidomide. This implies that pomalidomide exposure may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in patients. Monitoring of renal function is recommended during treatment with pomalidomide. Health professionals and patients are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate channels such as Bristol Myers Squibb or FDA MedWatch to contribute to the ongoing surveillance of drug safety.",NA
acute kidney injury,posaconazole,,"Evidence regarding the relationship between acute kidney injury and posaconazole exposure is not explicitly described in the provided sections of the drug label. The sections 5.5 (""Renal Impairment"") and 5.1 (""Calcineurin-Inhibitor Toxicity"") touch on subjects related to renal function; however, acute kidney injury as a direct adverse effect of posaconazole is not mentioned.

Section 5.5 highlights that patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored for breakthrough fungal infections when taking posaconazole formulations, suggesting that posaconazole exposure can vary in this population, but it does not specifically attribute renal impairment or acute kidney injury to the drug itself.

In section 5.1, there is a caution regarding concomitant administration of posaconazole with calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine or tacrolimus, which can have nephrotoxic effects. Elevated trough concentrations of these drugs due to interaction with posaconazole could lead to nephrotoxicity, indirectly suggesting a potential for renal injury. However, the renal adverse outcomes such as acute kidney injury seem to be a result of drug-drug interaction rather than a direct effect of posaconazole.

The clinical trials and postmarketing experience sections (6.1 and 6.2) list a range of adverse reactions; however, they do not report acute kidney injury as an observed side effect of posaconazole.

In summary, based on the information provided in the drug label sections, there is no direct evidence listed that posaconazole causes acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. The potential risk for renal injury appears to be associated with drug-drug interactions rather than with posaconazole itself. It is important to note that this summary is based on the provided sections of the posaconazole drug label, and further evaluation should be considered, including a review of the latest research literature and additional pharmacovigilance data to determine whether there have been any new findings about the relationship between acute kidney injury and posaconazole.",NA
acute kidney injury,pramipexole,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for pramipexole, acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as a reported adverse reaction in the context of clinical trials, post-marketing experience, or in the warnings and precautions sections.

Clinical trials experience (Section 6.1): There is no mention of acute kidney injury in patients with early Parkinson's disease or advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole either alone or concomitant with levodopa. The most common adverse reactions reported in the trials are related to the nervous system (such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hallucinations), gastrointestinal system (such as nausea, constipation), and cardiovascular system (such as postural hypotension).

Postmarketing experience (Section 6.2): The postmarketing experience reports additional adverse events that were identified after approval of pramipexole and are voluntary in nature, which again does not specifically mention acute kidney injury.

Warnings and Precautions related to systemic effects (Section 5): While there are various warnings regarding the potential for somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, impulse control disorders, and others, there is no warning of acute kidney injury.

Renal Impairment (Section 5.7): Pramipexole should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment due to renal clearance. Although there is a general cautionary statement for use in patients with renal impairment, this does not specifically address acute kidney injury as a potential adverse effect.

In all the evidence provided from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance within the drug label, there is no reported association between pramipexole use and acute kidney injury. It is important to note that adverse reactions are continually monitored and reported through pharmacovigilance activities, and prescribing information may be updated if new information becomes available. As such, it is advisable to review the most current drug labeling and evidence when assessing drug safety.",NA
acute kidney injury,pravastatin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and pravastatin exposure can be derived from the information provided by clinical trial experiences, case reports, post-marketing surveillance, as well as known pharmacological mechanisms of the drug.

1. Clinical Trials:
   According to the provided label sections, in pravastatin clinical trials, the myopathy and rhabdomyolysis adverse reactions are mentioned, with a special note on the risk of acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria as a result of rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy occurred in less than 0.1% of pravastatin-treated patients. Since rhabdomyolysis can lead to AKI, these sections suggest a possible but rare link between pravastatin use and AKI, mediated by severe muscle injury.

2. Post-Marketing Experience:
   The label mentions postmarketing reports of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. However, it does not explicitly list acute kidney injury as an identified reaction in the post-marketing experience section. However, because AKI can be a consequence of severe rhabdomyolysis, there is an implicit association that can be drawn from the reports of rhabdomyolysis.

3. Mechanistic Association:
   Rhabdomyolysis is a known serious condition whereby muscle breakdown leads to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can be harmful to the renal glomeruli and tubules, potentially leading to AKI. Therefore, any drug, including pravastatin, that is associated with rhabdomyolysis could have a potential, indirect contribution to AKI through this mechanism.

In summary, direct evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance specifically listing acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction of pravastatin is not provided in the label information. However, pravastatin is associated with rare occurrences of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to AKI. Therefore, indirect evidence suggests a possible, albeit rare, relationship between pravastatin exposure and AKI, rooted in the established pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis-related renal damage. Healthcare providers should be aware of this potential risk, especially in patients with additional risk factors for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.",NA
acute kidney injury,prednisone,,"After analyzing the provided drug label sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) and considering current medical literature, there is no direct evidence cited in the provided sections that explicitly associates prednisone with acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction.

Prednisone is a corticosteroid drug used to reduce inflammation and suppress immune system activity for a variety of conditions. Common adverse reactions associated with corticosteroids like prednisone involve fluid and electrolyte disturbances, musculoskeletal issues, gastrointestinal and dermatologic conditions, metabolic effects, neurological responses, endocrine changes, and ophthalmic side effects as listed on the drug label. It mentions potential for fluid retention, which could theoretically lead to complications that may indirectly impact kidney function. However, AKI is not listed as a known adverse reaction from the use of predniside directly.

In the absence of specific mention in the adverse reactions section, the relationship between prednisone and acute kidney injury would require further investigation through scientific research, clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance data for conclusive evidence.

To provide a definite conclusion regarding AKI as a potential adverse reaction to prednisone, additional sources such as peer-reviewed studies, clinical trial results, and analysis of post-marketing surveillance databases would need to be reviewed. If such evidence exists or emerges, it would require evaluation in the context of other factors that may contribute to AKI including patient-specific variables (such as pre-existing kidney conditions, concomitant medications, and overall health status).

Given the current information, there is no known evidence from the sections provided that directly supports a relationship between prednisone exposure and acute kidney injury. It is advisable to consult additional medical databases and resources for the most recent and comprehensive evidence on this topic. If there have been reports or studies published after my last update in early 2023, it would be important for healthcare providers to review the most current literature to make informed decisions on the prescribing of prednisone.","NA

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not listed among the adverse reactions in the provided sections of the drug label for prednisone. The sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings do not mention AKI as a known adverse effect associated with prednisone. It’s important to note that the absence of AKI in these sections does not completely preclude the possibility of its occurrence, as drug reactions can be idiosyncratic or emerge post-approval. However, based on the information provided, there is no evidence specifically refuting or establishing AKI as an adverse reaction of prednisone. If new information emerges or if AKI is observed in practice, it may warrant further investigation and potentially a drug label update."
acute kidney injury,pregabalin,,"The provided drug label sections from pregabalin's prescribing information do not specifically cite acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions and warnings listed focus on issues such as angioedema, hypersensitivity, suicidal behavior and ideation, respiratory depression, dizziness and somnolence, peripheral edema, weight gain, ophthalmological effects, and changes in laboratory parameters such as creatine kinase and platelet counts.

In controlled clinical trials, side effects that most commonly led to discontinuation included dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema, but there were no explicit mentions of AKI. Additionally, the post-marketing experience did not list AKI among the reported adverse reactions but did include general kidney-related issues under ""rare"" occurrences, such as acute kidney failure. However, acute kidney injury or renal impairment was not reported or defined as a significant side effect in the data provided.

Given the information available and without access to external sources beyond the label, there are no direct references to AKI as a known adverse reaction to pregabalin. Additional external sources, like peer-reviewed articles, registry data, or case studies, would be required to provide evidence of any potential association between pregabalin exposure and AKI.

To make a definitive statement on this topic, a thorough review of the scientific literature, including case reports, clinical study data, and post-marketing surveillance, would be necessary to determine if there is documented evidence linking pregabalin with AKI. If such a relationship were established in the literature, it would involve detailing the nature of the evidence, such as incidence rates, relative risk, and the plausible biological mechanisms by which pregabalin could induce AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,propafenone,,"The provided drug label sections for propafenone, a Class IC antiarrhythmic medication, include detailed information on adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings but do not specifically mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction related to this medication.

The sections 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS and 6.2 Postmarketing Experience detail various side effects experienced by patients during clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, which commonly include issues related to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. The adverse reactions listed range from unusual tastes to congestive heart failure (CHF), as well as hematologic issues like agranulocytosis and leukopenia. Nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder, was mentioned under ""Other"" in section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS; however, this condition is distinct from AKI and does not directly indicate that AKI is a known adverse reaction of propafenone.

The Postmarketing Experience section (6.2) reports the identification of ""kidney failure"" during post-approval use of propafenone. The term ""kidney failure"" can encompass AKI but the label does not provide information on the frequency of this event or a definitive causal relationship to propafenone exposure.

The Warnings and Precautions section (5) does not include AKI as a specific risk, focusing more on cardiac risks and interactions with other medications, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and myasthenia gravis, among others.

In conclusion, while the label acknowledges ""kidney failure"" in postmarketing experience, it does not provide sufficient information to establish a clear and direct evidence of a relationship between AKI specifically and propafenone use. Consequently, the relationship between AKI and propafenone use is not clearly supported by the information provided. Clinicians prescribing this medication should monitor renal function as part of comprehensive patient care, but the available label information does not allow for a definitive statement regarding AKI as a potential adverse reaction to propafenone.","After reviewing the provided drug label sections, there is no direct evidence in the clinical trial data or postmarketing experience suggesting that acute kidney injury (AKI) is an adverse reaction of propafenone. The drug label details various adverse reactions and warnings associated with propafenone use, focusing mainly on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system effects. Although kidney-related issues such as kidney failure and hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion are mentioned under postmarketing experience, these do not specifically include acute kidney injury as a recognized adverse reaction.

Given the absence of explicit mentions of AKI in the provided sections of the propafenone drug label, and assuming that there is no additional data outside of this label that links propafenone with AKI, it appears that there is currently no evidence to refute or support the relationship between AKI and propafenone exposure.

However, it's important to note that postmarketing surveillance data is based on voluntary reporting, which may not capture all adverse events and may be subject to underreporting or reporting bias. Therefore, the lack of reported AKI cases associated with propafenone does not categorically rule out the possibility of such an adverse effect, but it does indicate that if there is a risk, it has not been recognized in the clinical trial data or the reported postmarketing experiences detailed in the drug label."
acute kidney injury,propofol,,"The evidence provided does not directly support a clear relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the exposure to propofol based on the standard adverse reaction reporting from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed among the common or less common adverse reactions for propofol use in both anesthesia/MAC sedation and ICU sedation adult patients.

From the selected sections of the drug label related to adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, renal issues captured include ""Urogenital: Cloudy Urine"" and ""Green Urine"" under the category of ""Incidence less than 1% - Probably Causally Related"" (Anesthesia/MAC Sedation), and ""Metabolic/Nutritional: BUN Increased, Creatinine Increased"" listed under the category of ""Incidence less than 1% - Causal Relationship Unknown"" (ICU Sedation). ""Kidney Failure"" is also mentioned under a general heading without a clear indication of frequency or causality.

These reports, while related to kidney function, do not explicitly diagnose AKI or establish it as a common adverse event linked to propofol. Kidney failure as mentioned in the label is not quantified, and it is unclear whether this constitutes acute or chronic kidney failure; additionally, there is no stated causality. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and Creatinine increases may be indicators of impaired kidney function which could suggest potential kidney injury, but again, causality is not established in the documentation provided.

It is essential to note that in clinical settings, AKI can result from a complex interplay of various factors, including but not limited to anesthesia drugs, patient's pre-existing conditions, surgical complications, and concomitant medications which might have nephrotoxic effects. Considering this, while there may be instances of AKI following propofol administration reported in clinical practice, the evidence from the supplied drug labeling sections does not establish a direct causal relationship.

In conclusion, according to the drug label sections provided, there is no clear and specific evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that directly associates propofol with acute kidney injury as a defined adverse event.",NA
acute kidney injury,propylthiouracil,,"After reviewing the relevant sections of the drug label for propylthiouracil, acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions. The adverse reactions section does mention nephritis and glomerulonephritis, which involve inflammation of the kidneys and can potentially lead to acute kidney injury. However, these conditions are distinct diagnoses and not synonymous with acute kidney injury itself.

The lack of specific mention of acute kidney injury may indicate that there is insufficient evidence to conclusively establish a direct causal relationship between propylthiouracil use and acute kidney injury. Evidence for a drug's safety profile typically comes from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. However, in this scenario, the provided sections do not provide enough information to determine the level of evidence supporting such a relationship.

To better understand the potential link between propylthiouracil and acute kidney injury, further research may be needed, including a review of medical literature for case studies reporting such adverse reactions and analysis of post-marketing surveillance data that could shed light on the frequency and circumstance under which acute kidney injury occurs following propylthiouracil exposure.

In conclusion, based on the information available in the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings of the drug label, there is no clearly stated evidence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to propylthiouracil. Further investigation into additional sources of clinical and post-marketing data would be necessary to ascertain if a causal relationship exists.",NA
acute kidney injury,quetiapine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the use of quetiapine is not explicitly stated in the provided sections of the drug label. These sections detail various adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with quetiapine usage but do not specifically mention AKI as a recognized adverse reaction.

To accurately summarize the evidence regarding AKI as a potential adverse reaction to quetiapine, we must rely on sources outside of the drug label, such as clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data. If such evidence exists, it would provide the necessary information to establish or refute the relationship between quetiapine and AKI.

As the drug label does not include AKI under adverse reactions or warnings, it implies that it may either be a rare occurrence or that there is not enough substantial evidence to include it on the label. Without specific data from clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance indicating AKI as a reaction, we cannot definitively state that there is a recognized relationship between AKI and quetiapine.

In conclusion, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no known evidence in the label that directly supports the relationship between AKI and the use of quetiapine. Further investigation into other medical literature or databases may be necessary to determine if there is evidence outside the label that suggests such a relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,quinapril,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, the relationship between quinapril exposure and acute kidney injury (AKI) can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials: Quinapril has been evaluated for safety in numerous subjects and patients, including controlled clinical trials. In terms of renal effects, the label states that increases in both serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed. Specifically, in the subset of patients treated with quinapril alone, 2% experienced an increase in serum creatinine and another 2% in blood urea nitrogen, which are both markers indicative of renal function impairment. With respect to patients treated for heart failure with quinapril, 11% had increased blood urea nitrogen and 8% had increased serum creatinine; these instances were more likely when patients were also taking diuretic therapy. These findings suggest a potential for renal impairment, including AKI, particularly in those with additional risk factors or concomitant therapies that may predispose to or exacerbate kidney injury.

Post-Marketing Surveillance: Within the section reporting clinically significant events seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience, acute renal failure is specifically mentioned as one of the adverse reactions. Although the frequency is not detailed, inclusion in this list indicates that instances of AKI related to quinapril use have been reported after the drug has been approved and used in a broader patient population outside of clinical trials.

No clear incidence rate or detailed case studies of AKI directly associated with quinapril are provided in the label. There is also no box warning specifically addressing acute kidney injury as a risk. It is important to note that AKI is categorized as a serious but less frequent adverse reaction, seen in both clinical trials and post-marking experience.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not one of the most common adverse reactions to quinapril, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to suggest it can occur. The actual rate of occurrence is not quantified in the data provided, but the implications are significant enough to merit inclusion on the drug label under adverse reactions. Health practitioners should monitor renal function in patients taking quinapril, especially in the presence of other risk factors for renal impairment.","Based on the information provided from the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections of the drug label for quinapril, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and quinapril. In fact, the label states that acute renal failure and worsening renal failure are possible adverse reactions to the drug, especially in the presence of other risk factors such as concomitant diuretic therapy. Increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, which are indicators of impaired kidney function, have been observed in patients treated with quinapril.

Specifically, the label mentions that ""increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed in 2% and 2%, respectively, of all patients treated with quinapril alone."" Additionally, in controlled studies of heart failure, ""increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 11% and 8%, respectively, of patients treated with quinapril."" These findings suggest that kidney injury is indeed a known risk associated with quinapril use, particularly when used in combination with diuretics.

Therefore, there is no available evidence to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and exposure to quinapril; rather, the drug label acknowledges this potential adverse reaction. Consequently, the appropriate response to your request, given the evidence, is 'NA'."
acute kidney injury,quinine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and quinine exposure seems to be largely based on post-marketing surveillance reports. While the adverse reactions section of the quinine drug label does not explicitly name ""acute kidney injury"" under this label, it does mention ""renal failure,"" ""renal impairment,"" and ""acute interstitial nephritis"" as possible adverse reactions. These conditions could be consistent with acute kidney injury which is a broad term that encompasses various forms of kidney damage.

The label further indicates that ""Chronic renal impairment associated with the development of TTP has been reported"" and ""Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in patients receiving quinine."" Both thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic anemia can lead to or be associated with acute kidney injury. TTP is a rare blood disorder that can cause blood clots to form in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to organ damage, including the kidneys.

Given the nature of post-marketing reports, causality can be difficult to establish with certainty. However, the fact that these renal issues have been reported following quinine exposure suggests at least a possible relationship between quinine and acute kidney injury. The observations are based on individual cases or small series of patients, and it should be noted that this evidence does not come from controlled clinical trials. 

In summary, while there is no direct mention of ""acute kidney injury"" in the adverse reactions for quinine and no controlled clinical trial data is provided, the drug's label cites renal-related problems that can be aligned with or indicative of acute kidney injury. These findings through post-marketing surveillance imply a need for caution and monitoring for kidney-related adverse effects in patients taking quinine.","NA

Quinine is associated with several adverse reactions that affect various body systems, including renal impairment. However, the provided drug label sections do not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and quinine exposure. Instead, the label explicitly mentions renal failure, renal impairment, and acute interstitial nephritis as reported adverse reactions, which aligns with the known side effects of quinine rather than refuting them. Therefore, the request for evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and quinine exposure is not applicable as the evidence supports a potential relationship."
acute kidney injury,radium,,"Based on the provided drug label information for Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride), which is used in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases, there is no direct clinical evidence stating that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction to radium-223. The focus of adverse reactions to Xofigo as noted in the label includes hematologic abnormalities such as anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Additionally, the label mentions events like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and peripheral edema.

The section on renal and urinary disorders mentions renal failure and impairment, noting that this was observed in 3% of patients treated with Xofigo versus 1% in the placebo group, using grades 1-4 for classification. However, it's important to distinguish that renal failure and impairment do not specifically classify as acute kidney injury but can encompass a spectrum of renal issues. There is no grade 3-4 acute kidney injury explicitly mentioned in the provided information, which usually correlates with severe adverse events.

The safety precautions in the drug label indicate the need to monitor blood counts and provide requisite supportive care to manage any adverse reactions, but there is no specific warning about acute kidney injury.

The effectiveness of Xofigo was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial that did not draw a direct comparison between Xofigo and other drugs regarding rates of acute kidney injury. Also, the label notes that adequate safety monitoring and laboratory testing was not performed to assess tolerance of Xofigo with subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy, which may be relevant if renal toxicity is posited in such a combination.

In summary, the provided sections of the drug label for Xofigo do not provide clear and direct evidence that acute kidney injury is a common adverse reaction of radium-223 dichloride. Renal failure and impairment were noted in a small fraction of patients, but the degree to which this encompasses acute kidney injury is not detailed. Further comprehensive studies or post-marketing surveillance data would be needed to confirm any potential association specifically with acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,radium,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence in the clinical trial or post-marketing surveillance data suggesting that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a recognized adverse reaction of Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride) treatment. Although renal failure and impairment are listed as adverse reactions experienced by a small percentage of patients (3% for Xofigo vs. 1% for placebo), the term ""acute kidney injury"" specifically is not mentioned. Additionally, these reactions could be multi-factorial and not solely attributable to Xofigo.

In the clinical trials section (6.1) of the label, the most common adverse reactions are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and peripheral edema, and the most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities include anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Renal failure and impairment are mentioned; however, the term ""acute kidney injury"" is not specifically used. Furthermore, the grade 3-4 adverse events for renal failure and impairment are reportedly low (3% in the Xofigo-treated group), with no specific indication that these were clinically characterized as AKI.

Warnings and precautions (section 5) discuss bone marrow suppression as a significant adverse event associated with Xofigo, but do not mention kidney-related adverse effects. Additionally, there is a concern for increased risk of fractures and mortality when used in combination with other drugs, such as abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone, but again no specific mention of AKI.

In summary, while renal failure and impairment are documented, the provided drug label sections do not provide specific evidence to support a direct relationship between acute kidney injury and Xofigo treatment. It is important to consider that adverse events such as renal failure can have various clinical manifestations and the term ""acute kidney injury"" may be used in a clinical context to describe certain cases. Health care providers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the FDA to further contribute to the post-marketing surveillance data.","NA

The provided drug label information does not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to radium (Xofigo), nor does it specifically mention acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction. Instead, the label indicates ""renal failure and impairment"" under the ""Renal and urinary disorders"" section, with a frequency of 3 incidents (Grade 1-4) in the Xofigo group compared to 1 incident in the placebo group in clinical trial data. Given this information, the relationship between acute kidney injury and Xofigo cannot be discounted, and therefore the request for evidence refuting the relationship is not applicable (NA). 

The label provides extensive information about hematologic abnormalities and bone marrow suppression as well-known adverse reactions. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring blood counts and managing myelosuppression, noting specific rates of Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities in the Xofigo group versus the placebo group. It also warns about the potential for increased fractures and mortality when Xofigo is used with abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone and highlights the need for contraception due to the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity.

Please note that if new evidence emerges or if post-marketing surveillance identifies acute kidney injury as a concern, the label and professional guidelines would be updated accordingly to reflect this. However, based on current information up to my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, no specific evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and Xofigo is provided."
acute kidney injury,raltegravir,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the sections provided from the drug label of raltegravir (marketed as ISENTRESS). The sections you have provided, which include adverse reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and post-marketing experience, do not mention AKI or related renal adverse effects as being directly associated with raltegravir exposure either in clinical trial settings (treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced adults) or post-marketing surveillance.

This evidence suggests that while raltegravir has a known side effect profile that includes some effects on muscle tissue such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, there is no reported direct link with AKI in the clinical trial data or officially reported post-marketing cases up until the knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, rhabdomyolysis can lead to AKI in severe cases, so the potential for an indirect association cannot be entirely ruled out, and it is important to use caution with raltegravir in patients with an increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.

In summary, based on the information from the sections provided, there is no known evidence to support a direct relationship between raltegravir and acute kidney injury. However, healthcare providers should remain vigilant for indirect renal effects in the context of severe muscle-related side effects like rhabdomyolysis. If there have been any updates or new data on this topic post-knowledge cutoff, they should be consulted for the most current information.","Based on the provided sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) of the drug label for raltegravir (ISENTRESS), there is no evidence listed that directly refutes the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and raltegravir exposure. The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in the label do not include acute kidney injury as a common or well-characterized side effect of this medication.

In clinical trials referenced in the document (STARTMRK, ONCEMRK, and BENCHMRK 1 and 2), the safety and adverse reactions of raltegravir were thoroughly evaluated. In these studies, Grade 2 to 4 creatinine elevations (indicative of changes in kidney function) were reported in a very small percentage of patients and did not indicate a substantial risk of acute kidney injury attributable to raltegravir.

Additionally, in the postmarketing experience section (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), where less common events are reported after the drug has been approved and is used in a wider population, no mention of acute kidney injury is made.

Therefore, in the absence of explicit evidence indicating that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction due to raltegravir based on the provided sections of the label, one could infer that current clinical and postmarketing surveillance data do not support a relationship between AKI and raltegravir. However, this should not be interpreted as definitive proof that there is no risk whatsoever, as postmarketing surveillance might not capture all possible adverse reactions, and individual patient risk factors or comorbidities could contribute to AKI in ways that are not fully characterized in the product label documentation."
acute kidney injury,ranibizumab,,"Based on the drug label information provided for ranibizumab, there is no direct evidence suggesting acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction commonly associated with this drug. The clinical trial experience with ranibizumab does not list AKI among the ocular and non-ocular adverse reactions that were observed at a significant rate (Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the label).

In the section detailing the non-ocular reactions (Table 2), renal failure and renal failure chronic are mentioned, with an incidence of 1% in the control groups and not listed among patients treated with ranibizumab during the trials. Therefore, these reactions appear to be rare and are not elevated in the treatment groups as compared to controls.

In the post-marketing experience (Section 6.4), which collects data after the drug has been approved and is in broader use, there is no mention of AKI as an identified adverse reaction.

Based on this information, it can be stated that according to the drug label and the available clinical trial data as of the latest update, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between ranibizumab and acute kidney injury. It is important to note that while post-marketing data does not specify AKI, under-reporting or delayed reporting can affect the available evidence on adverse reactions. Health professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities to help gather more data on the safety profile of ranibizumab.","Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and ranibizumab exposure, as AKI is not listed among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials or postmarketing experience for ranibizumab. In the clinical trials and studies mentioned (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3, RVO studies, etc.), renal failure and chronic renal failure are reported at very low incidences (1% or less), with no direct correlation to ranibizumab established.

To definitively refute the relationship between AKI and ranibizumab, detailed pharmacovigilance data, mechanistic studies, or specifically designed clinical studies investigating renal function would be required, which are not provided in the label information. Therefore, as per the available data, we cannot conclusively prove or refute the potential for ranibizumab to cause AKI without further investigation or data addressing this specific concern."
acute kidney injury,ranolazine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and drug exposure to ranolazine, based on the provided drug label sections, can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials:
- Ranolazine has been evaluated in controlled clinical trials involving 2018 patients with chronic angina. There is no direct mention of AKI as a common adverse reaction in the highlighted sections of these trials.
- It is noted that ranolazine can produce elevations in serum creatinine without affecting the glomerular filtration rate, indicating inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion rather than true renal impairment.

Postmarketing Experience:
- There have been postmarketing reports of renal failure, an event that can encompass AKI, although it is important to note that these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily and the frequency or causal relationship to ranolazine exposure is not consistently established due to the uncertainty of the population size.

Warnings and Precautions:
- Acute renal failure has been observed in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] < 30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine.
- Section 5.2 of the warnings advises monitoring renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min). A recommendation is made that if acute renal failure develops, ranolazine should be discontinued and appropriate treatment provided.

Laboratory Abnormalities:
- Ranolazine is reported to cause elevations in serum creatinine (by 0.1 mg/dL) regardless of previous renal function, indicating a potential adverse effect on the kidneys, which can be a marker of AKI. However, there is a note that these elevations do not indicate progressive renal impairment and are reversible after discontinuation of the drug.

In conclusion, while the drug label does not explicitly list AKI as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial experience section, evidence of potential drug-related renal effects comes from the postmarketing experience reports, warnings about acute renal failure in patients with severe renal impairment, and laboratory abnormalities indicating reversible creatinine elevations. As with all postmarketing data, establishing a firm causal relationship is challenging due to voluntary reporting and variable exposure levels. Nonetheless, caution is advised, especially in patients with existing renal impairment, and monitoring renal function is recommended following the initiation of ranolazine therapy.",NA
acute kidney injury,rasagiline,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for rasagiline, there is no direct evidence of acute kidney injury being an adverse reaction to rasagiline listed in the clinical trial experience (section 6.1) or in the postmarketing experience (section 6.2). The detailed adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions do not mention acute kidney injury as a known side effect of the drug.

In the clinical trial experience (section 6.1), the most common adverse reactions observed with rasagiline monotherapy and as an adjunct therapy were related to orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations, impulse control behaviors, and various others that do not include acute kidney injury. Postmarketing experience (section 6.2) similarly does not list acute kidney injury as an identified adverse reaction during post-approval use of rasagiline. 

Warnings and precautions specified in section 5 focus on issues such as hypertension, serotonin syndrome, somnolence, hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations, and impulse control behaviors, without any mention of renal function or acute kidney injury.

In summary, the provided sections of the drug label for rasagiline do not support a relationship between acute kidney injury and rasagiline exposure. There is no evidence in the clinical trials data or post-marketing surveillance presented in these sections that acute kidney injury is an acknowledged adverse reaction associated with the use of rasagiline. If concerns about this potential adverse reaction exist, it may be due to isolated case reports or data not captured in these sections of the drug label. Further review of scientific literature, including the latest studies and case reports, might be necessary to determine if any new evidence has emerged linking rasagiline to acute kidney injury.","NA

acute kidney injury,relugolix,,"Based on the provided drug label for relugolix (brand name ORGOVYX), there is evidence suggesting a relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure during the HERO clinical trial, which is indicated in the Serious Adverse Reactions section. Here is the summary of the evidence:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (HERO):
   - The HERO trial evaluated the safety of ORGOVYX in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Patients were either treated with orally administered ORGOVYX or with leuprolide acetate injections as per local guidelines.
   - ORGOVYX was noted to have serious adverse reactions occur in 12% of patients, with acute kidney injury reported in 0.6% of those patients. Additionally, acute kidney injury was cited as a fatal adverse reaction in 0.2% of patients receiving ORGOVYX.
   - The extent of patient exposure to ORGOVYX in the trial was substantial, with 91% being treated for at least 48 weeks, providing a meaningful period to assess the adverse reactions including acute kidney injury.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - The summary did not specifically list acute kidney injury as a postmarketing adverse reaction, but it mentions that adverse reactions reported post-approval are from a population of uncertain size, and the frequency or causal relationship to drug exposure may not always be reliable.

3. No Boxed Warnings:
   - Acute kidney injury was not included in the boxed warnings, indicating that while it is a serious adverse event, it may not be of the relative significance to warrant placement in this section based on available data.

In summary, the evidence from the HERO clinical trial suggests that there is an association between ORGOVYX (relugolix) and acute kidney injury, although the incidence appears to be relatively low. This association is reflected in the product's labeling under serious adverse reactions. Without additional context, such as patient characteristics or risk factors that could predispose to kidney injury, it is not possible from this label alone to fully assess the causality or generalizability of these findings. As for the postmarketing experience, there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury, which may mean that no further causal relationships have been identified or reported since the initial clinical trials, or that any cases have not been numerically substantial or well-documented enough to update the product label accordingly.

Please note that evaluation of medical evidence should also include a review of the most recent medical literature, professional guidelines, and other reliable sources to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the drug's safety profile.","Based on the supplied drug label information for relugolix (Orgovyx), acute kidney injury is listed among the serious adverse reactions occurred in 0.6% of patients receiving Orgovyx during clinical trials. Additionally, acute kidney injury was reported as a fatal adverse reaction in 0.2% of patients receiving the medication.

These findings are derived from the HERO clinical study—a randomized (2:1), open-label, clinical trial in patients with advanced prostate cancer, which compared the efficacy and safety of orally administered relugolix with leuprolide acetate, an injectable gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.

The reported incidence of acute kidney injury, both non-fatal and fatal, suggests a potential relationship between the adverse reaction and drug exposure to relugolix. Thus, refuting the relationship between relugolix exposure and acute kidney injury would not be supported based on the clinical trial data provided in the drug label.

However, it is important to note that acute kidney injury is a complex condition that can be influenced by many factors, including concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and the underlying disease for which relugolix is being prescribed. Therefore, causality is not established solely on the basis of a reported adverse event within a clinical trial, but the evidence available from the HERO trial does support a potential association.

Given the information in the label, a statement refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and relugolix exposure cannot be provided; hence the response for this scenario is ""NA."""
acute kidney injury,remdesivir,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and remdesivir (VEKLURY) exposure can be derived from clinical trial data and trial observations reported in the drug label provided.

Clinical Trials Evidence:

1. **NIAID ACTT-1 Trial**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included acute kidney injury (n=3) out of 532 patients treated with remdesivir. This indicates a potential relationship between remdesivir and AKI, although the incidence was relatively low.

2. **Study GS-US-540-5912**: This randomized, controlled trial involved hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 and renal impairment, including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. While adverse reactions reported were consistent with other trials of remdesivir, it is noteworthy that these patients were already renal-impaired. Acute kidney injury was not specifically listed as an adverse reaction in the results summarized in the provided sections of the drug label.

Laboratory Abnormalities:

1. **Changes in Renal Function Tests**: Laboratory abnormalities related to renal function such as decreased creatinine clearance, increased creatinine levels, and decreased eGFR were observed across several trials (ACTT-1, Trials 5773, 5774, 9012, and 5912), which may suggest a potential impact of remdesivir on renal function. These may not be direct reports of AKI but could indicate an effect on kidney function.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:

1. **Emergency Use Authorization Experience**: The label does not specifically list AKI under post-marketing surveillance, but it does report other adverse reactions identified during the use of remdesivir. Continuous surveillance might reveal more data regarding AKI as an adverse reaction in the broader patient population outside of clinical trials.

Overall, there is some evidence from clinical trials that supports a potential relationship between remdesivir and acute kidney injury, although the incidence appears to be low. Clinicians should be aware of this possible adverse effect and monitor renal function in patients receiving remdesivir. It’s important to note that additional post-marketing surveillance and further research may help clarify the strength of this relationship. However, since AKI is a common complication in patients with severe COVID-19, attributing causation can be complex, requiring a thorough investigation of each individual case to account for other potential contributing factors.","Evidence Refuting Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction of Remdesivir:

Based on the drug label information provided, acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported as an adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation in a small number of patients in the NIAID ACTT-1 trial (3 out of 532 patients treated with remdesivir). Additionally, increases in creatinine and decreases in creatinine clearance or eGFR (indicative of changes in kidney function) were reported as laboratory abnormalities in clinical trials.

However, the evidence needed to refute the relationship between AKI and remdesivir exposure is not directly provided in the drug label sections. Refutation would require sources that show no significant difference in the incidence of AKI between patients treated with remdesivir and those receiving a placebo or standard of care, after adjusting for other AKI risk factors such as disease severity, comorbidities, or concomitant nephrotoxic medications.

If such data were available, it would be necessary to examine whether AKI rates are comparable to those observed in similar patient populations without remdesivir exposure and to consider confounders that could influence kidney function in the context of COVID-19 treatment. Clinical trials like NIAID ACTT-1 do report AKI as an adverse reaction, but the presence of alternative explanations such as underlying disease severity or other treatments must be assessed. Additionally, post-marketing surveillance would provide broader insights into the incidence of AKI among remdesivir-treated patients in real-world settings.

Given that the provided information does not include specific evidence refuting AKI as an adverse reaction to remdesimvir, it is not possible to state definitively that there is no relationship. Further analysis of comprehensive data sources, such as additional clinical trials or large-scale observational studies not included here, would be necessary to support a refutation. If such analysis concludes that the rates of AKI are not significantly elevated in patients treated with remdesivir compared to appropriate control groups, this would constitute evidence refuting the relationship.

In conclusion, without further data explicitly refuting the association between AKI and remdesivir, evidence from clinical trials that does report AKI as an adverse event must be considered. Consequently, based solely on the information provided, the request for a concise summary refuting the relationship between AKI and remdesivir cannot be fulfilled without the availability of additional evidence."
acute kidney injury,remifentanil,,"Based on the provided drug label information for remifentanil (brand name ULTIVA), there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as a reported adverse reaction either in the context of clinical trials or post-marketing experience. Adverse reactions that are commonly associated with remifentanil use, as mentioned in the clinical trials data (Tables 11 through 17), include respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, muscle rigidity, nausea, vomiting, and increased postoperative pain, among others.

In the sections relevant to post-marketing surveillance (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), a variety of cardiovascular effects, serotonin syndrome, anaphylaxis, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, as well as hypoglycemia, are reported, but there is no specific reference to acute kidney injury.

The absence of acute kidney injury from both the clinical trial results and post-marketing surveillance data in the provided information suggests that either this condition has not been recognized as a significant adverse reaction linked to remifentil, or if it has occurred, its incidence may be low, not well-characterized, or not conclusively linked to the drug. Additionally, the presence of other risk factors that may contribute to acute kidney injury could complicate the attribution solely to remifentanil.

In conclusion, within the current scope of information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, there is no apparent evidence to suggest a direct and specific association between acute kidney injury and remifentanil exposure. If such evidence exists, it would be outside the limitations of the data provided and would require additional investigation, possibly including a review of external clinical studies, case reports, or pharmacovigilance data sources.",NA
acute kidney injury,rezafungin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to rezafungin (REZZAYO) has been reported, but it is not among the most commonly observed adverse reactions. Evidence available is from the pooled safety database in clinical trials for rezafungin.

In clinical trials involving 232 patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis, the adverse reaction of AKI was reported in less than 5% of patients treated with rezafungin. Patients received a 400 mg loading dose followed by a 200 mg once-weekly dose, with the maximum duration of dosing being 4 weeks. The specific frequency and severity of AKI cases, as well as any potential long-term outcomes, have not been detailed in the provided sections of the drug label (section 6.1), suggesting that while AKI has occurred, it might not be a prominent adverse effect in comparison to others.

The drug label lacks a clear warning or precaution specific to the risk of AKI, which may indicate that the relationship between rezafungin and AKI is not well-established or considered a major concern based on the clinical trial data available. It is worth noting that the mention of AKI might be based on isolated occurrences, and the causality has not been fully described.

In summary, there is minimal evidence from clinical trials that suggests a potential relationship between rezafungin exposure and the occurrence of acute kidney injury, but the incidence appears to be low (<5% reported in clinical trials). There have been no specific Boxed Warnings or highlighted Warnings and Precautions within the label indicating a significant known risk for AKI with rezafungin usage. Further analysis of patient-level data from clinical trials would be required to better understand the nature and causality of the AKI events reported.

Additionally, no evidence from post-marketing surveillance has been provided. Post-marketing surveillance often includes a wider and more diverse population and could reveal adverse reactions not detected in clinical trials. For a more comprehensive understanding, it would be important to assess post-marketing data once it becomes available.
","Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury is mentioned as one of the less common adverse reactions in patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis who received REZZAYO (rezafungin), occurring in less than 5% of patients. However, this information alone does not conclusively refute the relationship between rezafungin and acute kidney injury. Instead, it indicates that while acute kidney injury has been observed, it is not among the more frequently reported adverse reactions.

Additional evidence to refute the relationship would typically involve controlled clinical studies or observational research demonstrating no increased risk of acute kidney injury with rezafungin compared to controls or compared to the incidence rate in the general population. This evidence is not provided in the drug label sections supplied, so I cannot offer a summary of evidence refuting the relationship without further information.

If there are clinical trials, observational studies, or meta-analyses specifically examining the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients taking rezafungin versus those not exposed to the drug, and those studies find no association, that data could be considered evidence refuting the relationship. To provide a precise answer, I would need access to such studies or data, which are not included in your message.

acute kidney injury,rifampin,,"The provided drug label excerpt for Rifampin outlines various adverse reactions associated with its use. Notably, under the 'Renal' subsection, it specifies that elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum uric acid have been reported. Furthermore, rare instances of hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, and acute kidney injury (AKI) have been observed. These renal effects are generally categorized as hypersensitivity reactions, commonly occurring during intermittent therapy or upon reinitiation of treatment after intentional or accidental interruptions. Fortunately, most of these reactions are reversible upon discontinuation of the drug and initiation of appropriate treatment.

The label does not provide specific prevalence rates or incidences for AKI due to voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size, making it difficult to reliably estimate frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure. Additionally, no detailed information from clinical trials is provided in the excerpt regarding AKI as a potential adverse reaction to Rifampin.

It is typical for post-marketing surveillance to identify rare adverse effects that might not have been detected in clinical trials, given the larger and more diverse patient population exposed to the drug after its approval. As such, the report of AKI sits alongside other adverse events identified through post-marketing reports.

In conclusion, although the exact incidence is not quantifiable from the provided information, there is evidence from post-marketing reports linking Rifampin to acute kidney injury as a potential adverse reaction. This reaction appears to be part of a spectrum of hypersensitivity-related renal effects and may be reversible if Rifampin is promptly discontinued and appropriate treatment is initiated. However, the evidence does not come from controlled clinical trials but rather from post-marketing surveillance, which often involves spontaneous, voluntary reporting and lacks the rigor of systematic data collection.","NA

The provided sections of the drug label for rifampin, which encompass adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, do not present evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and rifampin exposure. The label does list renal adverse reactions including interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure, suggesting that there is an acknowledged risk of renal adverse effects associated with the drug. Therefore, based on this labeling information, there is no available evidence refuting the association between acute kidney thyroid and the use of rifampin."
acute kidney injury,ritonavir,,"The provided drug label information for ritonavir does not list acute kidney injury (AKI) as a recognized adverse reaction observed in the clinical trials, nor does it appear under the laboratory abnormalities or postmarketing experience sections. The adverse reactions documented in clinical trials (Table 2) and postmarketing experience (section 6.2) include a variety of gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, metabolic, musculoskeletal, nervous system, psychiatric, respiratory, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, but do not explicitly mention AKI.

However, there is a mention in the postmarketing experience of renal insufficiency related to an event of dehydration, hypotension, or syncope. Nephrolithiasis is also listed under renal and urinary disorders in the postmarketing experience, which can be a risk factor for AKI. It is important to note that postmarketing reporting of adverse events does not establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to a lack of controlled conditions, and often it is not possible to estimate their frequency accurately.

While not specified, the drug interactions section (5.1 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) warns against co-administration with other medications that might lead to serious reactions due to the effect of ritonavir on liver metabolism. Though nonspecific, this could imply a potential for indirect renal effects if ritonavir alters the metabolism of drugs that are nephrotoxic.

There is also a specific caution in the drug label regarding toxicity in preterm neonates related to the excipients alcohol and propylene glycol contained in the oral solution form of ritonavir (Section 5.2), which mentions adverse events including lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, among others. It should be noted that these events were primarily reported in preterm neonates and are associated with the excipients, not ritonavir itself, and are not direct evidence of AKI resulting from ritonavir exposure in the general population.

In summary, the evidence directly linking ritonavir to acute kidney injury in adult patients as a typical adverse reaction is not provided in the clinical trial results or listed as a common adverse reaction in the drug label. Postmarketing observations suggest possible renal-related events, but these do not adequately establish a relationship between ritonavir exposure and acute kidney injury, and controlled clinical trials did not list AKI as an observed adverse reaction.

acute kidney injury,rivastigmine,,"Based on the information provided about rivastigmine, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in either the clinical trials experience or post-marketing experience sections of the drug label. The reported adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance primarily include gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, as well as other effects like allergic dermatitis and increased cholinergic activity leading to various neurological and psychiatric symptoms.

Gastrointestinal adverse reactions are particularly noted, with significant nausea and vomiting observed at a higher rate than with placebo, and the potential for dehydration as a consequence of these symptoms is acknowledged. Additionally, extrapyramidal symptoms and seizures are highlighted under neurologic effects due to increased cholinergic activity. Cardiac disorders (such as tachycardia), hepatobiliary disorders (abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis), and other nervous system disorders (seizures) are mentioned among the postmarketing experiences, but acute kidney injury is not listed among the observed adverse reactions.

Based on this evidence, it can be stated explicitly that there is no known direct evidence within the provided sections of the drug label that suggests a relationship between acute kidneyification of these functions. Dementia may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery.  The administration of rivastigmine may also result in adverse reactions that are detrimental to these functions. During treatment with the rivastigmine tartrate, routinely evaluate the patient’s ability to continue driving or operating machinery.jury and rivastigmine exposure. If acute kidney injury has been observed with rivastigmine use, it may not be a widely recognized or documented event, and it would not be part of the established safety profile of the drug as reflected in this labeling information.

To provide a definitive answer on whether there is any connection between acute kidney injury and rivastigmine, a thorough review of the latest scientific literature, case reports, and additional pharmacovigilance data beyond this label would be required. However, based on the current drug label provided, no evidence supports this association.",NA
acute kidney injury,roflumilast,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to roflumilast, marketed as DALIRESP, is limited but is identified in the adverse reactions section of the drug label. Roflumilast is an oral medication used for the treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of frequent exacerbations.

Clinical Trial Data:
In the provided drug label information under section 6.1, acute renal failure is listed among the serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in patients treated with DALIRESP as compared to placebo in controlled clinical trials. However, specific incidence rates or comparative data between the drug and placebo are not provided in this section, nor are there details about whether these renal events were directly attributed to the medication or to other factors.

Post-Marketing Experience:
Section 6.2 covers postmarketing experience, which includes adverse reactions identified from spontaneous reports. It is important to note that these spontaneous reports are from a population of uncertain size, and it is not possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to DALIRESP exposure. Acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed in this section, which suggests that either it was not reported with significant frequency or that a connection to the drug could not be established.

Given the information provided, we can deduce that acute renal failure has been reported as a serious adverse reaction in controlled clinical trials, although the information is insufficient to quantify this risk or to thoroughly evaluate causality. It is not prominently highlighted as a common adverse effect nor as a part of the warnings and precautions, which typically indicates that if there is a risk, it might be considered low or infrequent.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label sections, there is mention of acute renal failure observed in the clinical trial setting, but detailed evidence supporting a strong or frequent association between acute kidney injury and roflumilast exposure is lacking or not explicitly detailed. Healthcare providers should consider this potential risk when prescribing DALIRESP, but due to the absence of detailed data or strong post-marketing signals, the relationship between roflumilast and acute kidney injury cannot be fully characterized based on the current summary. Further investigation and detailed assessment of individual case reports or additional studies would be needed to clarify this relationship.",NA
acute kidney injury,roflumilast,,"Based on the provided sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) from the drug label, there is no explicitly stated evidence linking roflumilast and acute kidney injury in the summaries of the DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 clinical trials or the post-marketing surveillance.

The clinical trials detail that the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with roflumilast (ZORYVE cream) and more often than those treated with the vehicle cream are diarrhea, headache, insomnia, application site pain, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned as a common adverse reaction in these results.

Furthermore, in the follow-up with 594 subjects in open-label extension trials lasting up to 64 weeks, the adverse reaction profile observed in these trials was consistent with the initial vehicle-controlled trials, with no new adverse reactions such as acute kidney injury reported.

To conclude, the evidence from the summarized drug label sections does not support a relationship between roflumilast exposure and acute kidney injury. If such evidence were to exist, it would likely be reported in sections pertaining to less common adverse reactions or post-marketing reports. However, these specific data are not included in the provided text. For a comprehensive assessment, additional data outside of these sections would need to be reviewed, such as more detailed safety analyses or post-marketing reports that might capture rare or delayed adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials.","Based on the provided drug label sections for roflumilast (ZORYVE cream), there is no mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in both the short-term clinical trials (DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2) and the long-term open-label extension trials. The listed adverse reactions include diarrhea, headache, insomnia, application site pain, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections, but not acute kidney injury. 

Since acute kidney injury is not mentioned as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial data summarized, this suggests there is no evidence from these trials to support acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction of roflumilast. It should be noted that the absence of reported events in clinical trial data does not definitively rule out the possibility of such an event occurring, but it indicates that there is no evidence of a causal relationship based on the data provided.

To further refute any relationship between acute kidney injury and roflumilast, additional post-marketing surveillance or large observational studies would need to be reviewed. However, such evidence is not provided here. If there were data refuting the relationship, it would typically involve a comprehensive evaluation of reported kidney-related events from a broad patient population over a more extended period, possibly with comparison to a control group not exposed to the drug.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no evidence within the summarized clinical trial and post-marketing surveillance data to suggest that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction of roflumilast."
acute kidney injury,romidepsin,,"Based on the information provided from the prescribing information of romidepsin (marketed as ISTODAX), there is evidence to suggest a possible relationship between romidepsin exposure and acute kidney injury (AKI).

In clinical trial data under the section ""Serious Adverse Reactions,"" there is a specific mention of one death due to acute renal failure in Study 1, indicating a severe case of kidney injury in the context of romidepsin treatment. Acute renal failure is a serious condition and a form of AKI, thereby demonstrating a direct instance where romidepsin has been associated with an adverse kidney event.

No other explicit mention of AKI or related renal issues such as increased serum creatinine or decreased glomerular filtration rate is noted in the provided sections, including the ""Warnings and Precautions"" and general adverse reactions sections. The provided label excerpts do not indicate AKI as a common adverse reaction or as a condition requiring specific monitoring. However, the report of acute renal failure as a serious adverse reaction is critical evidence of romidepsin's potential nephrotoxic effects.

No additional data from post-marketing surveillance, specifically concerning AKI, have been provided in the excerpt. Therefore, we cannot assess the incidence or the level of risk of AKI based on post-marketing data.

It is worth noting that serious and fatal infections were a prominent adverse effect reported, which could potentially contribute to AKI in vulnerable populations, such as those with severe infections that may lead to sepsis and subsequent kidney injury.

In summary, there is at least one report from clinical trials of romidepsin associated with acute renal failure, which supports the potential for AKI as an adverse reaction to the drug. However, the overall incidence and characterization of this risk cannot be fully determined from the information available. Careful monitoring of renal function in patients receiving ISTODAX may be prudent based on the evidence of potential renal injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,romidepsin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions and warnings for romidepsin, there is evidence to support the relationship between romidepsin exposure and acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction.

From the clinical trial experience detailed in the label, among the 185 patients with Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) treated with romidepsin, there was one death reported due to acute renal failure in Study 1, which suggests a possible link between romidepsin and kidney injury. This was listed under the section detailing the occasions of deaths not due to disease progression, providing a signal of serious kidney-related toxicity potentially related to the drug.

Although the drug label describes other significant adverse reactions and safety concerns, such as myelosuppression, infections, electrocardiographic changes, and tumor lysis syndrome, it does not provide further cumulative incidence rates, detailed case reports, or specific data on acute kidney injury as a common adverse effect in the remaining clinical trial population.

In the absence of other listed incidence rates or specific reports of acute kidney injury in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance, the solitary mention of the death due to acute renal failure in the clinical trial section serves as the main evidence regarding the potential adverse effect of acute kidney injury associated with romidepsin. It is important to note that this does not establish frequency or causality but does raise concern for a potential serious adverse reaction that may require further surveillance and investigation.

For healthcare providers evaluating this risk, it would be essential to monitor renal function in patients receiving romidepsin and to consider acute kidney injury in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with renal impairment during treatment. Additionally, vigilance for reporting and further investigation of any new cases of acute kidney injury in patients taking romidepsin would help to better define this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,ropinirole,,"There is currently no direct evidence listed in the provided drug label sections to suggest that acute kidney injury is an adverse reaction associated with the use of ropinirole. The adverse reactions detailed in the label for ropinirole, which include nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition, viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, dyspepsia, and others, do not mention acute kidney injury. Additionally, the warnings and precautions do not highlight acute kidney injury as a known risk.

Clinical trials experience for ropinirole is divided into different sections, detailing the adverse reactions observed in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa), advanced-stage Parkinson’s disease (with L-dopa), and in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). In all the clinical trials mentioned, there is no report of acute kidney injury being observed in patients taking ropinirole.

Furthermore, postmarketing experience lists withdrawal symptoms, augmentation, and early-morning rebound in RLS among other effects, but does not provide any information on acute kidney injury as a postmarketing finding for patients treated with ropinirole.

In summary, based on the sections provided from the drug label for ropinirole, there is no known evidence to support a relationship between ropinirole use and acute kidney injury. Without data from additional sources such as independent case studies, a different section of the label detailing renal-specific adverse effects, or postmarketing surveillance data specifically showing this relationship, the assertion that ropinirole is associated with acute kidney injury cannot be substantiated.",NA
acute kidney injury,rosuvastatin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and rosuvastatin use primarily arises from the link between rosuvastatin-associated myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and subsequent acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria. While the drug label provided does not directly cite AKI as an adverse reaction, it mentions conditions that indirectly contribute to the development of AKI under certain circumstances.

Here's a summary of the supporting evidence:

1. Rosuvastatin and Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis:
   - Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) on the drug label describe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis as significant adverse reactions related to rosuvastatin, particularly at high doses.
   - Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known cause of acute kidney injury due to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can lead to tubular obstruction and kidney damage.

2. Risk Factors for Rhabdomyolysis-Associated AKI:
   - The label specifies that patients with renal impairment are at higher risk for myopathy when using rosuvastatin (Warnings and Precautions 5.1), acknowledging that existing renal issues could be exacerbated by muscle injury.
   - It recommends temporary discontinuation of rosuvastatin in acute conditions associated with a high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis.

3. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - While the clinical trial data provided (Section 6.1) does not show an explicit mention of AKI as an adverse reaction, it highlights that muscle-related side effects like myopathy and increased creatine kinase (CK) levels are reported, which are risk factors for AKI.

4. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Section 6.2 of the label lists various postmarketing reports of adverse reactions. Although AKI is not specifically mentioned, the nature of reported muscle and liver disorders suggests a potential for severe cases to contribute to AKI indirectly.

5. Related Conditions:
   - The Warnings and Precautions section (5.4) notes observations of proteinuria and hematuria, which are often signs of kidney issues, though they were transient and not directly linked to AKI.

In summary, while acute kidney injury is not directly listed as an adverse reaction to rosuvastatin in the information provided, the documented serious muscle damage, including rhabdomyolysis, which is a recognized pathway to AKI, establishes an indirect link. Clinicians monitoring patients on rosuvastatin should watch for signs of muscle injury and consider the potential risk for the subsequent development of AKI, especially in the presence of other risk factors or higher doses of rosuvastatin. There could be additional reports or studies beyond the scope of this information that may further clarify the relationship between rosuvastatin and AKI.","NA

acute kidney injury,rucaparib,,"The drug label for rucaparib provides some evidence that acute kidney injury (AKI) can be an adverse reaction experienced by patients taking this medication. Specifically, in the section outlining the clinical trials experience with rucaparib, it is noted that dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 57% of patients receiving rucaparib, with adverse reactions requiring such interruption including acute kidney injury, among others. Additionally, the laboratory abnormalities table from the TRITON2 trial, which investigated the safety of rucaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with BRCA mutations, shows that an increase in blood creatinine—a clinical marker indicating kidney impairment—was observed in 43% of patients (Grades 1-4 collectively) treated with rucaparib, although it does not specify the number of Grade 3-4 reactions which would correlate with serious AKI.

In summary, clinical trial evidence from the TRITON2 study and clinical trials experience noted in the drug label suggest that there is an association between rucaparib treatment and adverse effects on kidney function, including acute kidney injury. The level of elevations in creatinine observed (43% for all Grades 1-4) indicates this is a relatively common finding. However, further details such as the severity and reversibility of AKI, potential risk factors, and mechanistic understanding of how rucaparib may cause AKI are not provided in this label data. It is also important to note that the drug label does not mention AKI directly within the most common adverse reactions or the clinical trial adverse reaction summary tables. Clinical judgment should be used to assess the risk versus the benefit of rucaparib in patients with or at risk of kidney impairment. 

For more conclusive evidence, it would be necessary to review the full clinical study reports, the published literature on rucaparib's safety, and reports from post-market surveillance.

acute kidney injury,sacituzumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy), there is significant information relating to its safety profile, including common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials. However, there does not appear to be any explicit mention of ""acute kidney injury"" (AKI) as a common adverse reaction in these sections.

Here is a summary and analysis of relevant safety data from the label concerning AKI:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- The safety population data pooled from four studies (IMMU-132-01, ASCENT, TROPiCS-02, TROPHY) involving 1063 patients showed a list of most common adverse reactions (≥25%) but did not specifically include AKI.
- Table 3, pertaining to laboratory abnormalities in the ASCENT study, does not explicitly list AKI; however, decreased creatinine clearance was observed in 28% of patients, which may imply renal impairment.
- In the safety evaluation of sacituzumab govitecan in the IMMU-132-01 study, which included 108 patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), there was again no explicit mention of AKI.
- The adverse reactions and lab abnormalities from the ASCENT, TROPiCS-02, and TROPHY studies do not list AKI as a ≥10% occurrence.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
- No data from post-marketing surveillance is provided within the drug label sections, so we cannot comment on AKI occurrences after market introduction based on this information.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- The ""Warnings and Precautions"" section details serious adverse reactions such as neutropenia and diarrhea but does not mention AKI.

**TROPHY Study:**
- In the TROPHY study focused on metastatic urothelial cancer, AKI was mentioned as an observed serious adverse reaction in >1% of patients, but the provided Tables 8 and 9 focused on adverse reactions do not contain specific percentages related to AKI.

In summary, acute kidney injury is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction (≥25% incidence) in the clinical trials mentioned in the provided drug label information. It is cited as a serious adverse reaction in the TROPHY study for metastatic urothelial cancer patients. To fully ascertain the relationship between sacituzumab govitecan and AKI, a detailed review of the TROPHY study data, further clinical trial results, post-marketing surveillance reports, and published case studies would be necessary. Given that drug labels are updated with new safety information, it would be prudent to review the latest version of the drug label and recent literature for any updates regarding AKI as a potential adverse reaction to sacituzumab govitecan.","NA

acute kidney injury,saxagliptin,,"Evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance regarding saxagliptin (brand name Onglyza) and acute kidney injury (AKI) can be summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials:**
The prescribing information for saxagliptin has outlined renal impairment in the SAVOR trial as an adverse reaction related to saxagliptin use. Adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including increased serum creatinine levels and acute renal failure, were reported in 5.8% of saxagliptin-treated subjects compared to 5.1% of placebo-treated subjects. There was also a mean decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to treatment end. A slightly higher percentage of patients treated with saxagliptin experienced a shift from normal or mild renal impairment to moderate or severe renal impairment compared to placebo-treated patients.

**Case Studies:**
Specific case studies have not been cited in the supplied label information. For a comprehensive assessment, independent case reports from medical literature would need to be reviewed, which are not included in the provided information.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
While post-marketing experiences have been reported for saxagliptin, including hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, arthralgia, and bullous pemphigoid, the label does not specifically mention acute kidney injury. The post-marketing surveillance section mentions only that additional adverse reactions have been identified but generally does not allow for reliable estimation of frequency or confirmation of a causal relationship due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the uncertainty regarding population size.

**Conclusion:**
There is evidence from the clinical trial (the SAVOR trial) that links saxagliptin treatment to renal impairment-related adverse events, which include observations relevant to acute kidney injury such as increased serum creatinine and decreased eGFR. The post-marketing experience outlined in the label does not provide specific evidence of acute kidney injury as a discrete reported adverse event; however, it does not negate the possibility, given the clinical trial data. Additional independent case studies and more robust post-marketing surveillance data would be valuable in further clarifying the relationship between saxagliptin and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,saxagliptin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence that suggests a relationship between saxagliptin (Onglyza) and acute kidney injury (AKI), primarily derived from the results of the SAVOR trial, which is a large clinical study.

In the ""Renal Impairment"" section of the drug label, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including acute renal failure, were reported. Specifically, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, such as doubling of serum creatinine and serum creatinine levels greater than 6 mg/dL, were observed in 5.8% of patients treated with saxagliptin compared to 5.1% in the placebo group. Additionally, from baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for patients treated with saxagliptin.

The evidence of AKI as an adverse reaction was further supported by statistical data showing that a greater percentage of patients treated with saxagliptin experienced a downshift in eGFR from greater than 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (normal or mild renal impairment) to 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or less (moderate or severe renal impairment) compared to placebo.

The relationship between saxagliptin and AKI is also indicated by the inclusion of observed adverse reactions such as renal impairment, acute renal failure, and renal failure in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups.

Outside of clinical trials, no specific mention of acute kidney injury related to saxagliptin exposure was found in the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section. However, postmarketing surveillance is essential for detecting rare or late-occurring side effects and additional cases could potentially contribute to understanding the link between saxagliptin and AKI.

In summary, clinical trial evidence, particularly from the SAVOR study, highlights a potential relationship between saxagliptin and acute kidney injury manifesting as decreased renal function and, in some cases, as significant renal impairment. It is important for healthcare providers to consider this risk when prescribing saxagliptin, especially in patients with existing kidney issues or other risk factors for AKI. Regular monitoring of renal function is advised for patients taking saxagliptin.","Based on the provided drug label sections for saxagliptin (Onglyza), acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction in the clinical trial data nor is it indicated under the adverse reactions section (6.1) of the prescribing information. Moreover, there is no mention of AKI in the warnings, or box warnings (sections 5), which typically highlight significant and serious adverse reactions.

It should be noted that under section 6.1 ""Renal Impairment"" in the provided label, adverse reactions related to renal impairment are mentioned, with some patients experiencing laboratory changes indicative of renal impairment or renal failure. However, it specifies that the most frequently reported adverse reactions did not include AKI in that description but rather general renal impairment, acute renal failure, and renal failure. It is also detailed that shifts in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were noted, but such shifts do not directly equate to AKI and could be related to other types of renal impairment.

Given that acute kidney injury is a specific clinical diagnosis characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function over a period of hours to days, resulting in the retention of waste products and dysregulation of fluid and electrolyte balance, its absence from the label suggests that there was no concrete evidence from the pooled clinical trials to indicate a direct relationship between saxagliptin and acute kidney injury.

In summary, the evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to saxagliptin comes from the omission of this specific condition from the drug's listed adverse reactions in clinical trials, warning sections, and postmarketing experience according to the provided drug label. If additional studies or post-marketing data specifically examine the potential relationship between saxagliptin and AKI, such evidence would need to be reviewed for a more comprehensive evaluation."
acute kidney injury,semaglutide,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in the diabetes medication Rybelsus, can be discerned from clinical trial data and post-marketing experience, as highlighted in the provided drug label sections.

Firstly, the section 5.5 of the Warnings and Precautions in the drug label specifically addresses ""Acute Kidney Injury"" and notes that postmarketing reports have found incidents of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide. These events have occurred in some patients who did not have known underlying renal disease and were often associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions leading to severe dehydration.

The postmarketing experience mentioned, however, is based on voluntary reports and does not provide a frequency of occurrence, nor does it definitively establish a causal relationship due to the potential reporting bias and lack of controlled conditions.

To minimize the risk of AKI, the label advises monitoring renal function when starting or increasing doses of Rybelsus in patients who report severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration.

Regarding clinical trial data, there is no explicit mention in the provided sections of the label of AKI occurring at a significant rate during the trials (Sections 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience and 6.2 Postmarketing Experience). However, it should be noted that the patient population participating in the trials included a small percentage of patients with moderately impaired renal function at baseline (1.4% in the placebo-controlled trials and 5.4% in the placebo- and active-controlled trials), and AKI could have been reported as part of the overall safety monitoring.

It’s worth noting that while the drug label indicates the need to monitor renal function in the event of severe gastrointestinal reactions, explicit evidence of the incidence of AKI from clinical trials is not provided in the summary.

In summary, while the drug label warns about the potential risk of AKI with semaglutide and implies a plausible connection between the drug and AKI, the evidence from clinical trials regarding the incidence of this adverse event is not detailed in the provided sections. Post-marketing reports have suggested a relationship, but these are not sufficient to establish a causal link due to limited information on incidence and the absence of controlled conditions. Further examination of complete clinical trial data, regulatory agency reviews, and ongoing surveillance would be necessary to better quantify the risk and validate the causal relationship between semaglutide and acute kidney injury.","Based on the provided drug label sections for Semaglutide (RYBELSUS), there is mention of ""Acute Kidney Injury"" under the headings for Adverse Reactions (6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5). Specifically, the label indicates that there have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Semaglutide (RYBELSUS). Some of these events were in patients without known underlying renal disease, and many were associated with severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Consequently, the drug label advises monitoring renal function in patients who report severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.

There is no direct evidence provided in the label that refutes the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure; on the contrary, the label suggests a potential association between semaglutide and acute kidney injury, warranting precaution and monitoring. As such, the summary indicates that the relationship between acute kidney injury and semaglutide cannot be refuted based on the information in the drug label.

NA"
acute kidney injury,sertraline,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for sertraline, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction in the listed clinical trial experience, warnings, or post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions and post-marketing experiences described in sections 6 ""Adverse Reactions,"" and 6.2 ""Post-marketing Experience"" of the sertraline prescribing information do not include AKI.

Acute kidney injury is a serious condition characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the blood, disturbed electrolyte levels, and fluid balance issues. If AKI were suspected to be related to sertraline use, it might theoretically fall under the broader category of ""Renal and urinary disorders,"" but the only specific adverse effect mentioned in this category within the post-marketing experience is ""acute renal failure."" 

Although the term ""acute renal failure"" could encompass acute kidney injury, the lack of direct reference to AKI implies that either this condition has not been reported with sufficient frequency or definitiveness to be included in the label or that it is not recognized as a common or well-established adverse effect of sertraline. In the absence of explicit labeling for AKI as an adverse effect or further data such as case reports or observational studies linking sertraline to AKI, there is no publicly available evidence to conclusively support a relationship between acute kidney injury and sertraline exposure.

However, healthcare providers should remain vigilant and consider the patient's full clinical picture when assessing potential drug-related adverse events. Should new evidence emerge, regulatory authorities may update the prescribing information accordingly. If AKI is suspected in a clinical context with sertraline use, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report this to the drug manufacturer or directly to the FDA MedWatch program to contribute to post-marketing surveillance data.",NA
acute kidney injury,siltuximab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for siltuximab, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials referenced. Adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of greater than 10% in the SYLVANT (siltuximab) arm in Study 1 included rash, pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, increased weight, and hyperuricemia. Renal impairment is listed as an adverse reaction but only occurred in 4 out of 53 patients (approximately 8%) during the first 8 infusions and was not described as being severe or classified as acute kidney injury.

However, renal impairment was observed in the context of the trials and is a broad term that could potentially include acute kidney injury among other renal issues. The label does not provide details on the severity or specific nature of the renal impairment observed, the study's definitions of renal impairment, nor does it establish a causative relationship with acute kidney injury.

Regarding long-term experiences with siltuximab (Study 2 and other clinical studies), important adverse reactions were reported to be very common, though specific renal outcomes are not detailed in the provided text. The label mentions that the rate of serious or Grade ≥3 adverse events did not increase over time as a function of cumulative exposure to siltuximab, without citing acute kidney injury as an identified risk.

In conclusion, there is no direct evidence in the sections provided from the drug's label that establishes a link between siltuximab and acute kidney injury. Renal impairment is noted but not classified as acute or as a common reaction (occurrence of more than 10%). For a more precise understanding of the potential relationship between siltuximab and acute kidney injury, additional detailed clinical data and post-marketing adverse event reports would need to be reviewed if available. If such reports exist but are not provided, it is recommended to consult databases such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) or publications with post-marketing surveillance data for further investigation.",NA
acute kidney injury,siltuximab,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction directly associated with siltuximab in the cited clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.

In describing the adverse reactions from Study 1 and Study 2, the sections specify various other adverse reactions related to different body systems, including skin disorders (such as rash and pruritus), infections, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic disorders, and vascular disorders among others. Renal impairment is mentioned as an adverse reaction observed in 4 (8%) of patients treated with siltuximab in the MCD clinical trial during the initial 8 infusions but it does not elaborate specifically on acute kidney injury. Furthermore, this is not identified as a Grade 3 or 4 reaction, which would denote a more severe manifestation. There is no mention of renal impairment or acute kidney injury in the 'Warnings and Precautions' section either.

It is important to note that the absence of reported acute kidney injury in the provided sections does not completely rule out the potential for this adverse reaction to occur. The actual incidence of adverse reactions could be underreported or may not be captured in the published clinical trial data. Additionally, other factors in clinical practice, such even as patient comorbidities, concomitant medications, and other patient-specific factors, could potentially contribute to the development of adverse renal events not captured in the original trial data.

Unless additional information from case studies, literature, or more recent post-marketing surveillance indicating a link between siltuximab and acute kidney injury is available, we must conclude that, as of the provided label sections, there is no direct evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction and the exposure to siltuximab. For the most current information, it would be prudent to consult the latest medical literature and current drug labels or regulatory authority databases.",NA
acute kidney injury,sirolimus,,"There is evidence suggesting a potential association between sirolimus use and acute kidney injury (AKI), specifically when used in combination with cyclosporine. The evidence available from the provided drug label sections indicates the following:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: 
    - Sirolimus has been studied in clinical trials for prophylaxis of organ rejection following renal transplantation. Adverse reactions reported in these trials include increased creatinine levels, which could suggest renal impairment (Section 6.1). 
    - Patients receiving 2 mg of Sirolimus Oral Solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than those receiving 5 mg per day, implying a possible dose-related risk for adverse reactions including those affecting renal function (Section 6.1).
    - In clinical trials, the combination long-term use of sirolimus with cyclosporine showed an associated decline in renal function. This combination therapy resulted in higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared to controls, indicating a risk for kidney injury (Section 6.1 and 5.8).
    - A subset of maintenance renal transplant patients who converted from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus experienced a higher rate of serious adverse events, including deterioration of renal function (Section 6.4).

2. **Warnings and Precautions**: 
    - The label advises careful monitoring of renal function in patients receiving sirolimus, particularly when administered concomitantly with cyclosporine, due to the increased risk of renal function deterioration (Section 5.8).

3. **Proteinuria**: 
    - Monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended due to reported cases of proteinuria and new-onset nephrotic syndrome in maintenance renal transplant patients who converted from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (Section 5.9).

4. **Postmarketing Experience**: 
    - Reported adverse reactions post-approval include cases of AKI and nephrotic syndrome, which have been observed in the postmarketing setting. These cases provide anecdotal evidence of an association between sirolimus and kidney injury (Section 6.7).

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance, and the drug's own warning labels to suggest that sirolimus is associated with an increased risk of AKI, particularly when used in combination with other nephrotoxic drugs such as cyclosporine. This association is further supported by reports of increased serum creatinine and proteinuria in patients receiving sirolimus. Health care professionals are advised to monitor renal function in patients on sirolimus, especially when used alongside other potential nephrotoxic agents.",NA
acute kidney injury,sitagliptin,,"The evidence supporting the association of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the use of sitagliptin, a medicine primarily used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, comes from post-marketing surveillance data. According to the drug label sections provided, there have been postmarketing reports indicating that AKI has occurred in patients taking sitagliptin, sometimes necessitating dialysis.

Here is the evidence from the sections provided:

1. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
- There have been reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure which in some instances required dialysis. These reports have emerged from a wider population of users following the approval and widespread use of sitagliptin. It is important to note that some of the reported cases involved patients with preexisting renal impairment or those who were given doses of sitagliptin that were not adjusted for their level of renal function.

2. Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.3):
- Sitagliptin has a warning specifically for acute renal failure. It states that acute renal failure has been reported postmarketing, with some cases necessitating dialysis. It also mentions that some patients experienced a return to their baseline renal function upon discontinuation of sitagliptin and other potentially causative agents, which suggests a reversal of the adverse event upon the withdrawal of the drug.

The clinical trials and studies mentioned (Sections 6.1 and in laboratory tests subsection) in the provided sections of the drug label do not specifically address the rate or risk of AKI in a controlled clinical context. However, the recognition of AKI within postmarketing surveillance and its inclusion in the Warnings and Precautions section indicates regulatory awareness and concern regarding this potential adverse reaction.

In summary, while controlled clinical trials did not highlight AKI as a side effect of sitagliptin, postmarketing surveillance suggests a possible association. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor renal function before starting sitagliptin therapy and periodically thereafter, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those at higher risk for renal dysfunction. The reports from postmarketing surveillance underscore the importance of monitoring kidney function in patients treated with sitagliptin.",NA
acute kidney injury,sodium phosphate,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to sodium phosphate, specifically from the use of OsmoPrep Tablets for colon cleansing, is detailed in both clinical study data and post-marketing experience as seen on the drug label.

Post-marketing surveillance has provided crucial evidence of this relationship. There have been rare but serious reports of acute phosphate nephropathy, a type of acute kidney injury directly caused by phosphate crystal deposition in the renal tubules, in patients using oral sodium phosphate products like OsmoPrep. In some cases, these adverse reactions have resulted in permanent impairment of renal function, and some patients required long-term dialysis. 

According to the warnings section of the label, certain populations may be at increased risk for developing this condition, including older individuals, patients with pre-existing dehydration (hypovolemia), those with a slow bowel transit time, active colitis, pre-existing kidney disease, and those taking medications that affect renal perfusion or function (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and possibly NSAIDs).

This adverse reaction is severe enough to have merited inclusion in the drug label, implying that the relationship between AKI and the use of OsmoPrep is well recognized and clinically significant. Furthermore, it suggests that health care providers should use caution and consider these risks when prescribing this medication, especially in the populations mentioned who are at higher risk.

In this instance, although the specifics of the clinical trial data in relation to AKI are not provided, the inclusion of acute phosphate nephropathy under postmarketing experiences and the detailed risk factors and populations at risk in the warnings section serve as evidence for the relationship between AKI and sodium phosphate exposure through OsmoPrep Tablets. The emphasis the drug label places on following the recommended dose and dosing regimen may be part of a strategy to minimize the risk of this serious adverse reaction.","NA

The available evidence from the provided sections of the drug label (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) indicates that acute kidney injury, specifically acute phosphate nephropathy, is indeed a recognized potential adverse reaction associated with the use of sodium phosphate products like OsmoPrep Tablets for colon cleansing. The warnings section specifically cites ""rare, but serious reports of acute phosphate nephropathy"" and some cases resulting in permanent renal function impairment or requiring long-term dialysis. Therefore, it is not appropriate to provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and sodium phosphate exposure because the evidence supports the existence of such a relationship."
acute kidney injury,solifenacin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for solifenacin (a muscarinic antagonist used to treat overactive bladder symptoms), acute kidney injury is not listed as a known adverse reaction from clinical trials (Section 6.1), nor is it mentioned in the post-marketing experience (Section 6.2). The clinical trials section reports on 1811 adult patients and focuses on the expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and others, while the post-marketing surveillance includes voluntary reports of various adverse reactions but does not specifically name acute kidney injury.

The warnings (Section 5) discuss the increased risk of urinary retention, a condition that can theoretically lead to kidney injury if severe and prolonged, but the link between solifenacin and acute kidney injury is not explicitly made in the labeling. Instead, the document advises caution in prescribing solifenacin to patients with bladder outlet obstruction, as this could exacerbate retention issues.

In summary, based on the provided drug label, there is no explicit evidence supporting a direct relationship between solifenacin exposure and acute kidney injury in the form of clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance reports. However, there is a caution regarding urinary retention, which if left untreated or poorly managed, could, in theory, contribute to kidney injury. Without additional data or case studies directly linking solifenacin to acute kidney injury, a firm conclusion cannot be drawn. Careful monitoring of patients taking solifenacin with a predisposition to urinary retention is advised due to the theoretical risk of kidney complications from unresolved urinary retention.",NA
acute kidney injury,sorafenib,,"Based on the provided drug label for sorafenib, the evidence supporting the association of acute kidney injury with sorafenib exposure primarily comes from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data. Here’s the summary, noting each source of evidence:

Clinical Trials:
The clinical trials data presented in the label does not list acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned among the adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of patients or even among those reported at lower frequencies in the trials mentioned (SHARP (HCC) study and DECISION (DTC) study). Instead, adverse reactions associated with the renal and genitourinary system that were observed include renal failure, which was reported in <1% of patients treated with sorafenib in the SHARP (HCC) study and was not specifically listed for the DECISION (DTC) study. Hence, there is limited evidence from the clinical trials included in the drug label that directly associates acute kidney injury specifically with sorafenib use.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
As acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed among the post-marketing experiences, this suggests that if such an association has been observed, it has not been reported frequently enough to be classified as a recognized adverse reaction in the post-marketing setting, according to the provided labeling information. However, renal failure and proteinuria are mentioned as common adverse reactions in the Additional Data from Multiple Clinical Trials section, which can be associated with kidney impairment. 

Overall Conclusion:
While renal failure is reported as an uncommon adverse event in sorafenib-treated patients (clinical trials section), there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury either in the clinical trial data or the post-marketing experience section. It is important to note that renal failure could be indicative of severe renal impairment, which may encompass acute kidney injury. However, the label does not provide conclusive evidence that directly links sorafenibo use to acute kidney injury. Always be vigilant for new information and consult the most updated drug labeling and scientific evidence for the latest safety information.",NA
acute kidney injury,sparsentan,,"Evidence of the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and sparsentan (referred to as FILSPARI in the label) comes from clinical trial data and the drug label's warnings.

In the PROTECT clinical trial (NCT03762850), an ongoing randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study evaluating sparsentan in adults with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a median exposure duration of 73 weeks (up to 110 weeks) provided safety data on 202 patients. The labeling indicates that during this trial, acute kidney injury was reported as an adverse reaction in 4% of patients treated with sparsentan, compared to 1% in the irbesartan control group, suggesting a potential association between sparsentan and AKI.

Furthermore, Section 5.5 of the sparsentan drug label, under Warnings and Precautions, provides a precaution for acute kidney injury. This section advises monitoring kidney function periodically, especially since drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, which includes sparsentan, can cause acute kidney injury. The label specifically notes the risk for patients whose renal function depends in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, like those with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or those experiencing volume depletion. 

The label's guidance is to consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in kidney function while on sparsentan. These details further support the relationship between sparsentan and the risk of AKI, as recognized by the drug's labeling and the caution advised in monitoring patients for this potential adverse reaction.

No post-marketing surveillance data is mentioned, so it is not possible to include evidence from this source. It is advisable to consult the latest research and adverse event reporting databases for any additional information that may emerge after the knowledge cutoff date for this summary.",NA
acute kidney injury,spironolactone,,"The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and spironolactone exposure is suggested by information drawn from sections 6 (""ADVERSE REACTIONS"") and 5.2 (""Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function"") of the drug label. 

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
No direct mention of acute kidney injury within randomized controlled trials is provided in the sections referenced. However, the drug label notes under section 6 ""Renal dysfunction (including renal failure)"" as a reported postmarketing adverse reaction.

Evidence from Case Studies:
Specific case studies are not referenced in the provided sections of the drug label. 

Evidence from Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label does mention ""renal dysfunction (including renal failure)"" as an adverse reaction reported in the postmarketing experience. This refers to reports that have been collected after the drug was approved and released to the market. Nevertheless, because such adverse event reports can be voluntarily submitted and are not always verified, they should not automatically be interpreted as evidence that the drug caused the event. Additionally, it is essential to consider that ""renal failure"" encompasses acute kidney injury, but these terms are not synonymous—renal failure can be either acute or chronic in nature.

Warnings and Box Warnings:
Section 5.2 of the drug label cautions that excessive diuresis with spironolactone can lead to symptomatic dehydration, hypotension, and worsening renal function, especially in patients who are salt-depleted or on certain medications like ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. It is also noted that renal function may worsen with the concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs. While not directly stating acute kidney injury, this warning implies that kidney function can be adversely affected by the drug in certain circumstances.

Summary:
There is post-marketing evidence suggesting an association between spironolactone use and renal dysfunction, which may include acute kidney injury. Clinician awareness of this potential adverse reaction is reflected by warnings to monitor renal function periodically during treatment, especially when circumstances increase the risk of renal impairment. However, due to the nature of these data sources, which include voluntary reports and labeling precautions based on pharmacological expectations rather than direct evidence from controlled trials, a causal relationship is not definitively established. Further investigation in the form of well-designed clinical studies would be needed to establish a clear causal link between spironolactone use and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,sufentanil,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for Sufentanil Citrate Injection, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in clinical trials, warnings, or post-marketing experience. Here is a summary of the evidence related to other adverse reactions and warnings linked to sufentanil:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   Sufentanil was tested in controlled clinical trials involving 340 patients for epidural use during labor and delivery. Common adverse reactions included pruritus, respiratory effects, and muscle rigidity. The analgesic effects of sufentanil in combination with bupivacaine and epinephrine were assessed. No data within these trials specifically link sufentanil exposure to acute kidney injury.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   Voluntary reports of adverse reactions during post-approval use of sufentanil have identified additional risks not previously recognized during pre-market clinical trials, which include serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, anaphylaxis, androgen deficiency, opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and hypoglycemia. Again, acute kidney injury is not listed among the reported postmarketing adverse reactions.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   The label outlines risks associated with sufentanil use such as life-threatening respiratory depression, increased risks when used with CNS depressants or in patients with certain medical conditions, the potential for severe cardiovascular depression, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and other specific conditions where caution is advised.

There is express concern about the risks of opioid addiction, misuse, and abuse, which can lead to overdose and death, as well as the life-threatening respiratory depression that can occur with sufentanil use, especially in specific patient populations or in combination with other CNS depressants.

Overall, the evidence present in the drug label supplied does not indicate that acute kidney injury is an established or reported adverse reaction of sufentanil based on clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. For a definitive conclusion, it is essential to refer to the most current scientific literature, specialized databases, and adverse event reporting systems to check for any updates or additional cases that may have been reported after the knowledge cutoff date. If AKI has been linked with sufentanil after this date, that new evidence would not be included in this summary.",NA
acute kidney injury,sulindac,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for sulindac, there is evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury can be an adverse reaction to the drug. The ""Adverse Reactions"" section of the label lists various genitourinary issues related to sulindac use, which include:

- Renal impairment, including renal failure
- Interstitial nephritis
- Nephrotic syndrome

These conditions are indicative of acute kidney injury, which is a known adverse reaction associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including sulindac. The warning explicitly states that ""renal impairment, including renal failure"" has been observed, suggesting a link between the drug and kidney issues.

However, the label does not specify the frequency of these kidney-related adverse reactions, stating that some are observed at an incidence of less than 1 in 100, which indicates that they are relatively rare.

It's important to note that renal calculi containing sulindac metabolites have also been observed rarely, providing direct evidence of the drug's metabolism affecting the kidney in a way that could lead to injury.

The evidence from the drug label is considered post-marketing surveillance, as it encompasses data gathered after the drug has been approved and made available to the general population. Data from clinical trials is mentioned as the source of some adverse reactions, but specifics regarding the occurrence of acute kidney injury in those trials are not provided in the label.

While there isn't a detailed breakdown of the clinical evidence (such as findings from specific studies) in the drug label, the inclusion of kidney-related adverse reactions in the label itself serves as an authoritative source indicating that healthcare professionals and the regulatory authorities acknowledge a relationship between sulindac exposure and acute kidney injury.

Clinicians prescribing sulindac should monitor for signs of renal dysfunction, and patients are advised to report any symptoms suggestive of kidney injury to their healthcare provider. The label advises caution and recommends monitoring, especially in patients at greater risk of renal side effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,sumatriptan,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction to sumatriptan in the sections covering adverse reactions, warnings, or post-marketing surveillance. The label describes various other adverse effects, categorized by organ systems or by symptoms, but does not include renal-related adverse effects.

Clinical trials experience (Section 6.1) reports on adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the sumatriptan groups versus placebo, emphasizing atypical sensations, pain and pressure sensations, neurological effects like vertigo, and general malaise/fatigue. However, acute kidney injury is not listed within this section or any of the commonly reported adverse effects.

In the post-marketing experience (Section 6.2), while various cardiovascular, neurological, and hypersensitivity reactions are reported, acute kidney injury is not mentioned as an identified adverse reaction during the post-approval use of sumatriptan.

Warnings and precautions (Section 5) detail significant risks associated with the use of sumatriptan, including myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebrovascular events, and others, but there is no indication in these sections of any risk pertaining to acute kidney injury.

To comprehensively assess the potential relationship between acute kidney injury and sumatriptan use, a thorough review of the latest medical literature, including case reports, observational studies, and pharmacovigilance databases, would be necessary. Since the provided drug label information does not mention acute kidney injury as an adverse effect, this may suggest a lack of established evidence or that such an adverse reaction is exceedingly rare or not definitively associated with sumatriptan. However, absence of evidence in the drug label does not rule out the possibility entirely.

For an exhaustive evaluation, further investigation beyond the drug label, considering emerging data or rare case reports, would be required to determine if any potential link has been observed or reported in medical literature since the last update of the prescribing information.",NA
acute kidney injury,sunitinib,,"Summary of Evidence for Sunitinib-Associated Acute Kidney Injury:

While not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in the drug label provided for sunitinib, there is clinical evidence supporting the occurrence of renal-related adverse effects, such as proteinuria and increased creatinine, which could potentially lead to or indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). The specific evidences are as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Acute kidney injury is not directly reported as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials summarized in the label sections (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, Study 1 through Study 6).
   - Renal/Metabolic laboratory abnormalities reported include increased creatinine and proteinuria, which can be indicative of AKI.

2. Laboratory Abnormalities:
   - The label references Grade 3-4 increased creatinine in the laboratory abnormalities section, which signifies a severe impairment of kidney function (Table 6).

3. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Renal impairment and/or failure, which can encompass AKI, are listed as adverse reactions identified during postapproval use of sunitinib (Section 6.2).

4. Proteinuria:
   - Proteinuria is recognized as an adverse event, which may sometimes lead to renal failure or fatal outcomes (Section 5.8).

5. Warnings and Precautions:
   - The label does not explicitly mention AKI in the Warnings and Precautions (Section 5). Still, the consequences of severe cases of reported conditions such as proteinuria could potentially lead to AKI.

Overall, while the specific term ""acute kidney injury"" is not used, there is evidence within the provided label indicating renal complications associated with sunitinib use. Increased creatinine and proteinuria can be early signs of kidney injury, and renal impairment, including acute kidney injury, has been reported as post-marketing experiences. It is important to monitor kidney function when using sunitinib due to the potential for severe renal-related adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,tadalafil,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, acute kidney injury is not listed as a recognized adverse reaction to tadalafil within the context of clinical trials (section 6.1), post-marketing experiences (section 6.2), or within the warnings and precautions (section 5). Adverse reactions and warnings include hypotension, effects on the eye such as visual loss, hearing impairment, and prolonged erection, among others. 

Common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (section 6.1) include headache, myalgia, nasopharyngitis, flushing, respiratory tract infection, pain in extremity, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion. The post-marketing experiences section (6.2) that reports voluntarily observed adverse reactions does mention serious cardiovascular events but does not mention acute kidney injury.

Therefore, there is no known evidence in the provided sections of the drug label that directly supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and tadalafil exposure. Further investigation through additional medical literature, case studies, and clinical trial data outside of this information would be necessary to determine if any cases have been documented outside of these sources.","NA

Given the specific request for evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and tadalafil, and in the absence of any mention of acute kidney injury in the provided drug label sections, one can conclude that based on the labeling, there is no established relationship between tadalafil and acute kidney injury. This does not necessarily mean that there is an absence of risk, but rather that there is no reported evidence or specific warnings related to acute kidney injury in the provided sections of the label. It is important to consider that drug labels are updated as new information becomes available, so healthcare providers should monitor for updates and additional sources for the most current information."
acute kidney injury,telavancin,,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction of Telavancin**

The summary below outlines the evidence supporting the relationship between exposure to telavancin and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction:

1. **Clinical Trials Evidence:**
    - In the Phase 3 cSSSI (complicated skin and skin structure infections) clinical trials with 929 patients treated with telavancin, renal adverse events indicative of renal impairment were higher in the telavancin group (3%) compared to the vancomycin group (1%). Serious adverse events indicative of renal impairment occurred in 1% of telavancin-treated patients versus 0.3% in the vancomycin group. Additionally, telavancin treatment discontinuation due to renal impairment occurred in 12 patients as opposed to 2 patients in the vancomycin group.
    - Increases in serum creatinine levels to 1.5 times baseline were more frequent among telavancin-treated patients with normal baseline creatinine levels (15%) compared to vancomycin-treated patients (7%).
    - In the HABP/VABP (hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) trials, the incidence of renal adverse events was 10% for telavancin versus 8% for vancomycin. Twenty-eight-day mortality rates were higher for patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤50 mL/min) treated with telavancin compared to vancomycin, suggesting increased nephrotoxicity in these patients.

2. **Warnings and Precautions:**
    - The drug label includes a warning regarding increased mortality in HABP/VABP patients with pre-existing moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤50 mL/min) treated with telavancin as opposed to vancomycin.
    - Nephrotoxicity is noted as a significant concern, advising monitoring of renal function in all patients receiving telavancin.
    - Patients with baseline moderate/severe renal impairment showed a decreased clinical response in cSSSI trials.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
    - Although specific frequencies are not provided, the postmarketing experience section of the label acknowledges that nephrotoxicity, including AKI, was identified after approval of telavancin based on voluntary reports. 

4. **Additional Considerations:**
    - The label recommends that telavancin usage in patients with baseline CrCl ≤50 mL/min should be carefully considered, weighing the anticipated benefits against potential risks.
    - Renal function should be monitored regularly in patients on telavancin, especially considering that renal adverse events occurred more commonly in patients with baseline comorbidities predisposing them to kidney dysfunction and in those taking concomitant medications known to affect kidney function.

In conclusion, there is substantial evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that supports the relationship between telavancin exposure and the risk of developing acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. The evidence and the potential risks are clearly reflected in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label.","Based on the provided drug label sections for telavancin (VIBATIV), there is substantial evidence suggesting an association between telavancin exposure and adverse renal effects, including acute kidney injury (AKI). The label clearly states that nephrotoxicity and new onset or worsening renal impairment have occurred in patients treated with the drug. It provides detailed information on the incidence of renal adverse events in clinical trials for both complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP).

Clinical trial data demonstrates that patients treated with telavancin had higher rates of renal adverse events compared to vancomycin-treated patients. For instance, in the cSSSI trials, 3% of VIBATIV-treated patients experienced renal impairment versus 1% in the vancomycin group. The incidence of renal adverse events was higher in the HABP/VABP trials, with 10% for VIBATIV vs. 8% for vancomycin.

Moreover, the mortality rate was higher among patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤50 mL/min) treated with telavancin versus those treated with vancomycin.

Based on this evidence, acute kidney injury is indeed recognized as an adverse reaction to telavancin, and there is no concrete evidence refuting this relationship. Therefore, the response is ""NA,"" as the adverse reaction is related to the drug per the provided labeling."
acute kidney injury,telavancin,,"Clinical Trials Evidence:

The clinical trials section of the label indicates that in the complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) clinical trials, 3% (30/929) of patients treated with telavancin experienced renal adverse events indicative of renal impairment compared to 1% (10/938) of patients treated with vancomycin. Serious adverse events indicative of renal impairment occurred in 1% (11/929) of telavancin-treated patients versus 0.3% (3/938) of vancomycin-treated patients. There was a higher occurrence of increases in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline among telavancin-treated patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (15%) compared to vancomycin-treated patients (7%). Discontinuations due to renal adverse events were more common with telavancin (12 patients) than with vancomycin (2 patients).

In the hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) trials, renal adverse events occurred in 10% of telavancin-treated patients versus 8% for vancomycin. Rate of serious renal adverse events was 3% for both treatment groups. Increased serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline was more frequent with telavancin (16%) than with vancomycin (10%). Additionally, telavancin treatment discontinuations due to renal adverse events occurred in 2% of patients versus 1% with vancomycin treatment.

Post-marketing Surveillance:

The label noted that new onset or worsening of renal impairment has occurred post-approval, suggesting that the actual incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) may be higher or more apparent in broader clinical use than seen in the controlled environment of clinical trials.

Warnings and Precautions:

The warnings emphasize the increased mortality in HABP/VABP patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL/min) when treated with telavancin versus vancomycin. It also advises to monitor renal function in all patients receiving telavancin, indicating a concern for potential nephrotoxicity.

Box Warnings:

The box warning reiterates the increased mortality in HABP/VABP patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment and notes the potential for nephrotoxicity with new onset or worsening renal impairment on VIBATIV (telavancin).

Conclusion:

There is direct evidence from clinical trials and post-market surveillance that supports the relationship between telavancin exposure and acute kidney injury. The evidence is documented in the form of comparative incidences of renal adverse events, serious adverse events, treatment discontinuations due to renal impairment, and higher rates of creatinine increases in the clinical trials, and observations of renal impairment post-approval. The label contains strong warnings about the risk of nephrotoxicity, including explicit advice for monitoring renal function and considering risks versus benefits in patients with pre-existing ren impairment.","Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, there is substantial evidence to support the relationship between acute kidney injury (nephrotoxicity) as an adverse reaction and the use of telavancin (VIBATIV). The clinical trials and observations have indicated that there is an increased risk of renal adverse events in patients treated with telavancin as compared to those treated with vancomycin.

In the complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) trials, the incidence of renal adverse events indicative of renal impairment was higher in VIBATIV-treated patients (3%) than in vancomycin-treated patients (1%). Furthermore, increases in serum creatinine to 1.5 times baseline were observed more frequently in the VIBATIV group (15% with normal baseline serum creatinine) compared with the vancomycin group (7% with normal baseline creatinine).

For hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) trials, the incidence of renal adverse events was also higher in the VIBATIV group (10%) compared to the vancomycin group (8%). A higher proportion of VIBATIV-treated patients also experienced at least one serious renal adverse event (3%).

Additionally, there was an observation of increased mortality in HABP/VABP trials among patients with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤50 mL/min) treated with VIBATIV when compared to those treated with vancomycin. This has been explicitly stated in the boxed warning that suggests cautious use of VIBATIV in patients with pre-existing moderate to severe renal impairment due to increased mortality and nephrotoxicity.

Based on the adverse reactions and clinical trial data provided, there is no evidence to refute the relationship between the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury and exposure to telavancin. The drug label explicitly acknowledges nephrotoxicity as a serious adverse reaction and provides clear warnings regarding the risk. Monitoring renal function is recommended in all patients receiving VIBATIV due to the potential new onset or worsening of renal impairment.

Given this evidence, the relationship between acute kidney injury and telavancin exposure cannot be refuted. NA is not applicable as the evidence does not refute the relationship."
acute kidney injury,telmisartan,1.0,"Evidence regarding acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to telmisartan is not directly highlighted in the provided drug label sections. However, there are indications of potential renal effects that warrant attention:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
In placebo-controlled trials, an increase in creatinine levels was observed in 0.4% of patients treated with telmisartan compared to 0.3% in placebo patients. Importantly, one patient under telmisartan treatment discontinued therapy due to rises in both creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, which are markers of renal function. While this data suggests a link between telmisartan and changes in renal function, the low incidence does not explicitly establish acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction.

2. Warnings and Precautions (Renal Impairment):
The label indicates that as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), changes in renal function may occur in susceptible individuals. While telmisartan is primarily associated with vascular and cardiovascular effects, its impact on the RAAS could theoretically contribute to renal impairment, including AKI, particularly in patients with conditions causing pre-existing renal compromise.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
The drug label does mention ""renal impairment including acute renal failure"" as an identified adverse reaction during post-approval use of telmisartan. However, the label emphasizes that postmarketing reports are voluntary and the frequency or causality of these events to drug exposure is not reliably estimable.

4. Dual Blockade of the RAAS:
There is a warning against the concomitant use of telmisartan with other RAAS inhibitors, like ACE inhibitors or aliskiren, particularly due to the increased risk of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure.

In summary, the drug label does not provide strong evidence of AKI as a widespread and recognized adverse reaction of telmisartan based on the clinical trials data. Nonetheless, renal-related adverse effects, including increases in creatinine and rare cases of acute renal failure have been reported post-marketing and in the context of dual RAAS blockade. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor renal function when initiating telmisartan therapy, especially in patients with pre-existing renal conditions or those concomitantly using other RAAS inhibitors.","Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and telmisartan exposure. Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) that can affect renal function due to its action on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and kidney function.

The label does highlight potential renal function changes in susceptible individuals under ""WARNings AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5) Impaired Renal Function."" It indicates that treatment with ARBs has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. This suggests that acute kidney injury could be an adverse reaction to telmisartan, especially in patients with conditions where renal function may depend on the activity of the RAAS, such as those with severe congestive heart failure or renal dysfunction. 

Although the specific term ""acute kidney injury"" is not used, the label's mention of ""renal dysfunction,"" ""renal impairment including acute renal failure,"" and an increased incidence of renal dysfunction with dual blockade of the RAAS (seen in combination with ramipril) implies that acute kidney injury could be related to telmisartan use. 

Thus, while no evidence is provided that explicitly refutes the relationship, there are indeed warnings and clinical trial experiences listed on the label that support a potential link between telmisartan and adverse renal effects. Since acute kidney injury is a broad term that can encompass various renal issues, including those mentioned on the label, it cannot be definitively stated that there is no relationship between acute kidney injury and telmisartan based on the available information."
acute kidney injury,temsirolimus,,"Summary of Evidence:

The drug label for Temsirolimus injection does indicate evidence of a relationship between Temsirolimus exposure and acute kidney injury. Specifically, Section 5.8 of the Warnings and Precautions within the label warns of cases of ""rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal acute renal failure not clearly related to disease progression"" observed in patients treated with Temsirolimus. These cases were stated to be at times not responsive to dialysis. Additionally, the term ""renal failure"" is explicitly mentioned in Section 6 under Adverse Reactions.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The evidence found in clinical trial settings reinforces these concerns. Table 2 of the label reports laboratory abnormalities in clinical trial participants, where 57% of patients treated with Temsirolimus had increased creatinine levels (indicative of renal impairment) with 7% classified as Grade 3 or 4 severity (Section 6.1, Table 2). Furthermore, the label advises the monitoring of renal function both at baseline and during treatment with Temsirolimus injection (Section 5.8).

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing experience has further identified cases of renal failure in patients receiving Temsirolimus, as stated in Section 6.2 of the label, although specific frequencies and causal relationships to drug exposure are not always determinable due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

The evidence provided by the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data, included within the drug label, supports a relationship between Temsirolimus and acute kidney injury. Clinicians should be aware of these risks and monitor renal function in patients undergoing treatment with Temsirolimus injection, as the adverse events can be severe and potentially fatal.",NA
acute kidney injury,tenapanor,,"Based on the provided drug label sections regarding tenapanor, marketed as IBSRELA, evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) specifically as an adverse reaction is not explicitly documented. The label focuses on gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal distension, flatulence, and dizziness, which were the most common adverse reactions (≥2%) reported in the clinical trial data.

Although there is mention of patients with renal impairment within the clinical trial data, the focus is on reports of diarrhea, including severe diarrhea, in these patients. There is no direct indication that tenapanor exposure caused AKI. It is noted that in patients with renal impairment (defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 90 mL/min/1.73m^2), diarrhea was reported more frequently compared to placebo. Nevertheless, the incidence of diarrhea and severe diarrhea did not correlate with the severity of renal impairment, suggesting no direct causal link to renal function deterioration confirmed within the clinical trial data.

Additionally, there is a specific mention of hyperkalemia in a different patient population with chronic kidney disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which could indicate potential issues with electrolyte management in the presence of renal impairment. However, AKI as a distinct adverse reaction is not mentioned.

No box warnings or specific warnings/precautions sections within the label indicate AKI as a known adverse reaction of tenapanor. The boxed warnings predominantly focus on the risk of serious dehydration in pediatric patients.

To conclude, the provided drug label for tenapanor does not present evidence supporting a relationship between AKI and drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, and while there is discussion of patients with renal impairment and hyperkalemia, there is no clear indication that tenapanor is associated with inducing AKI. If such evidence exists in the scientific literature or post-marketing surveillance data outside what was provided, it would be necessary to review those sources to ascertain the potential risk of AKI with tenapanor exposure.",NA
acute kidney injury,tenofovir alafenamide,,"Evidence supports a potential relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to tenofovir alafenamide (marketed as VEMLIDY) based on both clinical trial data and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
In the provided label information, adverse reactions in renal laboratory parameters from two pooled clinical trials (Trials 108 and 110) are described. During these trials, subjects were monitored for changes in serum creatinine and median serum phosphorus levels, as well as for changes in estimated creatinine clearance over the course of the trials. While the mean serum creatinine increase and median serum phosphorus decrease were minimal, there was a noted decline in estimated creatinine clearance at Week 96 with -1.2 mL per minute in the VEMLIDY group compared to -4.8 mL per minute in those receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). This suggests a potential negative impact on kidney function, although the long-term clinical significance of these laboratory changes is unclear. Additionally, the trials show that switching from TDF to VEMLIDY led to improvement in the estimated creatinine clearance, further implicating tenofovir-containing treatment in impacts on renal function.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
According to the label, postmarketing experiences have reported occurrences of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, as adverse reactions during the use of tenofovir alafenamide-containing products, which includes VEMLIDY. Although postmarketing reports do not always establish a clear causal relationship due to potential confounders, they do suggest an association between drug exposure and renal adverse events. Such reports are consistent with the known nephrotoxic potential of tenofovir prodrugs.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug's label includes specific warnings and precautions related to new onset or worsening renal impairment, instructing practitioners to monitor serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein before and during the treatment with VEMLIDY. Patients with impaired renal function or those concurrently taking nephrotoxic agents are at an increased risk for renal-related adverse reactions. Additionally, they advise the discontinuation of VEMLIDY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.

Summary:
Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data suggest that tenofovir alafenamide can potentially cause or worsen renal impairment, including acute kidney injury. Monitoring of kidney function is recommended in the drug's label, and observed changes in renal laboratory parameters indicate that tenofovir alafenamide may adversely affect kidney function in some patients, supporting a cautious approach to its use in individuals with preexisting renal conditions or concurrent use with nephrotoxic drugs.",NA
acute kidney injury,tenofovir disoproxil,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to tenofovir disoproxil includes:

1. Clinical Trial Data:
   - The drug label you have provided does not list AKI directly as a common adverse reaction from the clinical trials of tenofovir disoproxil.
   - It does, however, indicate that ""New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment"" is a warning associated with the medication (see Warnings and Precautions 5.2).

2. Postmarketing Surveillance:
   - There is more direct evidence from postmarketing experience, which lists ""acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria"" as adverse reactions identified during the postapproval use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (see Postmarketing Experience 6.2).
   - These conditions are linked to kidney injury and suggest that AKI can be a potential consequence of drug exposure.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   - The drug label specifically mentions the need to monitor renal function and assess creatinine clearance prior to and during treatment with tenofovir disoproxil, especially in patients at risk of renal dysfunction (see Warnings and Precautions 5.2).
   - Advice is given to avoid concurrent use with nephrotoxic agents to mitigate the risk of renal impairment (see Warnings and Precautions 5.2).

To summarize, while AKI itself isn't explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial results provided in the drug label, there is a clear association between tenofovir disoproxil and potential renal impairment or renal adverse reactions based on postmarketing surveillance and highlighted warnings and precautions. This indicates that healthcare professionals should monitor renal function closely in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil to mitigate the risk of AKI and other renal-related adverse effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,tenofovir disoproxil,,"There is evidence supporting the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and exposure to tenofovir disoproxil, an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
From the adverse reactions summary of clinical trials data, Section 5.3 of the STRIBILD labeling indicates that renal impairment, including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (a type of renal tubular injury), has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a component of STRIBILD. It is specifically mentioned that 1.4% of subjects in the STRIBILD group discontinued the drug due to renal adverse reactions over 96 weeks. Moreover, 0.6% of these subjects developed conditions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD. Even with drug discontinuation, the renal impairment did not completely resolve in all subjects, although renal replacement therapy was not required.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
Section 6.2 of the labeling reflects postmarketing experience, citing acute renal failure and other renal and urinary disorders such as acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, and proximal renal tubulopathy as adverse reactions identified upon post-approval use of tenofovir DF.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The Warnings and Precautions (5.3) in the drug labeling additionally emphasize the risk of new onset or worsening renal impairment with STRIBILD, which includes cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome.

In the body of evidence described in the label, the renal adverse effects are causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, demanding careful monitoring of renal function in patients who are initiated on the medication and those who continue its use. Especially important is assessing creatinine clearance, urine glucose and protein, and, for at-risk patients, serum phosphorus. The labeling warns against initiating STRIBILD in patients with a creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min and recommends discontinuing if the creatinine clearance falls below 50 mL/min.

In summary, data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as accounted for in the STRIBILD drug label, provide evidence that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure is associated with the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury. This is substantiated by the reported incidences of renal adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, as well as the documented persistence of renal impairment despite cessation of the medication. Monitoring guidelines and recommended precautions further underscore the importance of considering this risk when prescribing and managing patients on tenofovir disoproxil-containing regimens.","While the provided drug label information for STRIBILD, which contains tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), includes numerous adverse reactions and safety warnings, it explicitly lists renal adverse reactions, including acute kidney injury (AKI), under both the clinical trials and postmarketing experience sections.

Section 5.3 directly addresses ""New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment"" and reports cases of AKI as an adverse reaction associated with the use of tenofovir DF, one of the components of STRIBILD. It is stated that renal impairment, including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in the context of tenofovir DF use. The section mentions that 10 (1.4%) subjects out of 701 treated with STRIBILD discontinued the medication due to a renal adverse reaction, and some developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, which improved but did not completely resolve upon discontinuation of the drug. Additionally, the label underscores the importance of monitoring renal function and avoiding the use of STRIBILD with nephrotoxic agents.

Based on the evidence and warnings provided in the label, it is clear that there is an established relationship between the use of tenofoiver DF and the potential for acute kidney injury. Given the specific mentions of AKI as an identified adverse reaction to tenofovir DF, refuting the relationship between AKI and drug exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not supported by the evidence presented in the drug label. Therefore, the response to the request for evidence refuting the relationship is ""NA."""
acute kidney injury,teriflunomide,,"Based on the provided drug label information for teriflunomide, evidence for a relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and drug exposure comes from clinical trial data.

In placebo-controlled studies, there was a slight increase in creatinine values (more than 100% over baseline) indicating potential kidney issues in a small percentage of patients receiving teriflunomide compared to the placebo group: 0.8% in the 7 mg AUBAGIO group, 0.6% in the 14 mg AUBAGIO group, versus 0.4% in the placebo group. These elevations were transient, and some were accompanied by hyperkalemia. It is also mentioned that teriflunomide may cause acute uric acid nephropathy with transient AKI because teriflunomide increases renal uric acid clearance.

There's no mention of AKI in the post-marketing experience section, suggesting that no significant cases attributed to AKI post-approval have been reported or established.

Therefore, the available clinical trial evidence suggests a potential but low risk of AKI in patients taking teriflunomide. These findings appear to be transient and not widely reported in the postmarketing surveillance data. Clinicians prescribing teriflunomide should be aware of this potential risk and monitor kidney function as appropriate.",NA
acute kidney injury,teriflunomide,,"The presented drug label information regarding teriflunomide, which is used primarily in the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, does in fact include evidence of a potential relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure. Specifically, the clinical trials experience section reveals that in placebo-controlled studies, an increase in creatinine values of more than 100% over baseline was observed in a small subset of patients.

Here is the summarized evidence from the various sources as provided in the label:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:**
   - Placebo-controlled studies showed an increase in creatinine levels more than double the baseline in 0.8% of patients in the 7 mg teriflunomide group and 0.6% in the 14 mg group, versus 0.4% in the placebo group.
   - These creatinine increases were transient and some were accompanied by hyperkalemia, suggesting an acute effect on renal function.
   - Teriflunomide may cause acute uric acid nephropathy with transient acute renal failure due to an increase in renal uric acid clearance.

2. **Postmarketing Experience:**
   - There is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury in the postmarketing experience. However, it's important to note such surveillance often reveals additional side effects not captured during clinical trials due to the wider and more varied pool of patients being exposed to the drug after its approval.

3. **Mechanism of Injury**:
   - While not explicitly described in the drug label provided, the statement that teriflunomide may increase renal uric acid clearance hints at a mechanism for renal injury. If uric acid is precipitated in the renal tubules, it could potentially lead to acute uric acid nephropathy, which may present as acute kidney injury.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trial data suggesting a low but notable incidence of acute kidney injury-related effects in patients taking teriflunomide, specifically reflected by increased creatinine levels and transient changes in renal function. The data does not indicate chronic renal failure or long-term impairment but does support a link between teriflunomide exposure and potential renal adverse reactions. Further research, possibly from longer-term postmarketing reports, would be valuable for a more comprehensive understanding of this risk.",NA
acute kidney injury,testosterone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a recognized adverse event in clinical trials or post-marketing experience specifically associated with testosterone gel, 1%. The label does include a variety of other potential adverse reactions and warnings, but AKI is not listed explicitly among them. 

The clinical trial experience (Section 6.1) outlines various adverse events that were observed, such as skin reactions, prostate disorders, and lab test abnormalities, which among other issues included elevated creatinine. Elevated creatinine can be indicative of impaired kidney function; however, the labeling does not indicate that this was classified or resulted in a diagnosis of acute kidney injury, nor does it provide the incidence rate or the clinical significance of this finding in relation to AKI.

Under post-marketing experience (Section 6.2), there are various adverse reactions reported; however, kidney-related issues are only mentioned once with a single patient discontinuing due to kidney failure. This does not provide enough information to establish a causal relationship with testosterone therapy, nor does it clarify if this was acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Warnings related to organ systems (Sections 5.10 and 5.11) also do not indicate AKI explicitly but do advise caution for patients with preexisting renal disease due to potential fluid retention and edema with testosterone use.

In summary, evidence from the provided drug label sections does not directly support a relationship between testosterone gel, 1%, and acute kidney injury as an adverse event. Clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance highlight other adverse reactions, with a very limited mention of kidney-related issues, but without sufficient information to confirm AKI specifically as a potential adverse reaction to testosterone. If robust data from controlled studies were available to establish such a link, one would expect AKI to be listed explicitly among the adverse reactions within the drug label.
",NA
acute kidney injury,tetracycline,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to tetracycline exposure is suggested by the documentation in the drug label that an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) has been reported and is dose-related. While the drug label does not explicitly mention AKI, an increase in BUN is a common laboratory finding associated with kidney injury or impairment, indicating that renal function may be compromised. 

The renal toxicity mentioned in the label warrants caution, especially considering that hepatotoxicity and liver failure have been observed in patients receiving tetracycline and those with renal impairment. This implies a potential risk for renal toxicity in susceptible individuals or those with pre-existing kidney conditions.

Clinical Trials:
Documentation from clinical trial data regarding the specific incidence of AKI due to tetracycline is not provided in the provided sections of the drug label. However, the reported increase in BUN during clinical trials serves as indirect evidence of potential renal impairment, which could lead to AKI.

Case Studies:
Specific case studies detailing instances of AKI in patients following tetracycline exposure are not provided in the drug label excerpts. Such case reports, if they exist in the literature, would offer valuable clinical insights into the nature of the adverse reaction and the conditions under which it occurred.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
The drug label does not provide specific information on post-marketing surveillance related to AKI. Such surveillance could include spontaneous reports from healthcare professionals and patients, which are critical in identifying rare or delayed adverse reactions not captured during clinical trials.

In the absence of explicit mention or detailed evidence of AKI in these excerpts from the drug label, and without additional sources such as case reports or post-marketing surveillance data, it is not possible to conclusively establish the relationship between AKI and tetracycline exposure. Given the variety of adverse reactions documented, healthcare providers should monitor renal function in patients prescribed tetracycline, particularly those with risk factors for kidney injury or pre-existing renal impairment.

For a complete assessment, a detailed review of the full drug label, additional sections of regulatory documents, the scientific literature, and databases such as PubMed for relevant clinical trials, case reports, and observational studies would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,thalidomide,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and the drug label for thalidomide, acute kidney injury (AKI) does not appear to be listed as a recognized adverse reaction to thalidomide treatment either in the adverse reactions section, or in the context of postmarketing surveillance.

In the detailed sections provided, acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction observed during the clinical trials outlined in Study 1 and Study 2, or in the postmarketing experience. Adverse reactions such as peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, dizziness, somnolence, venous thromboembolism, bradycardia, increased mortality in certain populations, and severe cutaneous reactions are mentioned amongst others, but not AKI.

In the additional postmarketing experience section, renal and urinary disorders are noted, and while renal failure and acute renal failure are reported, the incidence and causality with thalidomid use are not described, as these reports come from voluntary reports which makes it difficult to accurately estimate their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

Given that acute kidney injury is not enumerated in these sections, it is reasonable to conclude that as of the last update from the evidence and drug label provided, AKI is not a recognized or established adverse reaction to thalidomide. Clinical professionals should refer to the most current drug labels and medical literature for the latest information on drug safety and adverse reactions.",NA
acute kidney injury,thiotepa,,"Based on the information provided from various sections of the drug label for thiotepa, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as a common adverse reaction. The clinically significant adverse reactions listed under section 6.1 of thiotepa's labeling primarily include hematologic (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), hepatic (e.g., elevated transaminases), and gastrointestinal (e.g., mucositis, diarrhea) effects, among others.

Furthermore, section 6.2 details additional adverse reactions identified during the postmarketing experience involving thiotepa. This section includes a wide array of potential adverse effects, including various organ system disorders. Among these, ""renal and urinary disorders"" are mentioned with specific reference to ""renal failure"" and ""nephropathy toxic."" However, acute kidney injury, designated as a rapid decrease in kidney function, is not explicitly listed.

Renal failure and nephropathy toxic may encompass acute kidney injury but are not synonymous. While renal failure implies a severe loss of renal function and nephropathy refers to kidney damage, acute kidney injury is a broader term that may include milder forms of kidney dysfunction.

It is important to note that since postmarketing data relies on voluntary reporting, it is often underreported and may not always establish a causal relationship between the drug exposure and the adverse event. Moreover, the label's warning and precautions do not explicitly highlight renal toxicity as a major concern outside the context of the listed adverse effects.

To conclude, while renal failure and nephropathy toxic are acknowledged as potential adverse reactions to thiotepa in the postmarketing setting, there is no explicit evidence within the provided label sections that directly associates acute kidney see with the use of thiotepa. For a definitive conclusion, further analysis and investigation, such as examining specific data from clinical trials, case reports, or robust post-marketing surveillance studies, would be necessary.",NA
acute kidney injury,tiagabine,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and postmarketing reports for tiagabine, there is no direct evidence indicating that acute kidney injury (AKI) is an identified adverse reaction to tiagabine. In the comprehensive list of side effects and adverse reactions both from controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, AKI is not mentioned as an observed reaction to tiagabine.

The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation of tiagabine in clinical trials were neurological and gastrointestinal in nature, such as dizziness, somnolence, depression, confusion, and asthenia. While the reported adverse effects within the urogenital system category include dysuria, urinary incontinence, and urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury is not listed. Additionally, under the infrequent urogenital system events, ""kidney failure"" is mentioned; however, without further detailed information, it is not clear whether this refers to AKI or chronic kidney disease, nor is there a established causal link with tiagabine.

In terms of postmarketing reports, the document supplied does not include any mention of acute kidney injury. Postmarketing data can sometimes reveal rare adverse effects not detected in clinical trials, but based on the provided text, AKAl is not reported in connection with tiagabine after it has been approved for use.

Therefore, in conclusion, according to the provided material, there is no known evidence to support a relationship between tiagabine use and acute kidney injury. If the concern arises from clinical practice or individual case reports, it is not reflected in the data presented here. As with any potential drug-related adverse events, further investigation may be warranted if new evidence emerges from clinical practice or subsequent studies.",NA
acute kidney injury,ticagrelor,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:

The label for ticagrelor (BRILINTA) includes information from clinical trials such as PLATO, PEGASUS, and THEMIS, which collectively involved over 58,000 patients. The focus of these trials was on assessing the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in reducing thrombotic events in various patient populations. The primary adverse reactions identified were bleeding and dyspnea. Importantly, there is no mention of acute kidney injury as an observed adverse reaction in the context of these clinical trials. 

Post-marketing Surveillance:

The post-marketing experience section of the label also does not list acute kidney injury as a reported adverse event with ticagrelor use. The reported adverse reactions in the post-marketing setting include blood and lymphatic system disorders like Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP), immune system disorders such as hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, respiratory disorders, and skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders. 

Acute Kidney Injury Specific Evidence:

Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit evidence linking acute kidney injury to the use of ticagrelor as part of clinical trial observations or post-marketing surveillance that has been documented in the label.

However, it is worth noting that within the ""Lab abnormalities"" section under clinical trials, there is a reference to serum creatinine levels. In PLATO, there was an observed >50% increase in serum creatinine levels in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 5.9% in those receiving clopidogrel. This finding suggests that some patients may experience changes in renal function, but this does not directly indicate acute kidney injury, and the increases were stated to not typically progress and often decreased with continued therapy or upon discontinuation of treatment. The label also notes that there were no differences in treatment groups for serious renal-related adverse events such as acute renal failure.

Conclusion:

Based on the drug label content provided, there is no direct evidence to support that acute kidney, as defined clinically, is an adverse reaction associated with ticagrelor. Changes in serum creatinine were noted in a subset of patients, but these do not equate to acute kidney injury without further clinical context and evaluation. It is crucial for clinicians to monitor kidney function as part of comprehensive patient care when prescribing any medication, including ticagrelor.",NA
acute kidney injury,ticagrelor,,"Based on the provided drug label information for ticagrelor, there is no direct evidence mentioned that ticagrelor is associated with acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction. The label extensively discusses bleeding risks, dyspnea, bradyarrhythmias, and other potential adverse effects but does not specifically list acute kidney injury.

However, under ""Serum Creatinine"" in the Laboratory Abnormalities section, there is mention that in the PLATO clinical trial, serum creatinine levels were observed to increase >50% in 7.4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 90 mg (ticagrelor) compared to 5.9% in patients receiving clopidogrel. Although this increase did not usually progress and often decreased with continued therapy, it is an indication that renal function can be affected in some patients taking ticagrelor.

It is specified that the treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events, including acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In the PEGASUS trial, approximately 4% of patients receiving BRILINTA 60 mg showed a >50% increase in serum creatinine concentration, similar to aspirin.

While the evidence does not explicitly mention acute kidney injury, changes in serum creatinine levels can be a marker for potential kidney injury or dysfunction. Therefore, while acute kidney injury is not listed as a known adverse effect of ticagrelor in the provided label sections, there is evidence suggesting that ticagrelor can affect renal function to some degree in certain patients. Clinical professionals might consider monitoring renal function in patients taking ticagrelor as a precaution, especially in those with pre-existing renal conditions.

In summary, the drug label for ticagrelor does not provide evidence that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction to ticagrelor. However, alterations in serum creatinine levels in clinical trial participants taking ticagrelor indicate that the drug can impact renal function, which may warrant further investigation and monitoring in clinical practice.","Based on the provided drug label information, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to ticagrelor. However, it is noted in section 6.1 under ""Lab abnormalities"" that serum creatinine levels were observed to increase by more than 50% in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor. This increase usually did not progress and often decreased with continued therapy, with evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation. Additionally, clinical trial groups did not differ in terms of renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure.

In summary, while there is evidence of increased serum creatinine levels seen with ticagrelor, which might suggest potential renal effects, there is no explicit evidence in the provided drug label that directly links ticagrelor use to acute kidney injury. Moreover, the observed changes in serum creatinine were reversible and did not result in significantly different rates of renal adverse events compared to controls.

It is important to note that while the label does not explicitly list AKI as an adverse reaction, this does not confirm the absence of such a risk. For a thorough evaluation of the relationship between ticagrelor and acute kidney injury, additional studies beyond the label information would be needed."
acute kidney injury,ticlopidine,,"The provided drug label sections for ticloprimidine list several adverse reactions identified through clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and reported case studies, but acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly mentioned in the sections provided. The sections include a range of adverse effects, with gastrointestinal complaints and hematological conditions being most prominent.

From the provided information, we can see the following hematological adverse reactions have been reported:

- Neutropenia/agranulocytosis
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
- Aplastic anemia
- Hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis
- Immune thrombocytopenia

Moreover, several other conditions, including reports of liver dysfunction and hematological disorders, have been associated with ticlopidine, along with a variety of other less frequent adverse events.

It is worth mentioning that the actual incidence of aplastic anemia and TTP was reported in post-marketing data, with estimated incidences based on physician reports and assuming an event reporting rate of 10%. These figures suggest that such reactions are quite rare.

As for acute kidney injury (AKI), there is no direct reference to it as an adverse event associated with ticlopidine within the provided label sections. The label does mention ""renal failure"" under post-marketing experience, which could include AKI, but without specific data or references to the incidence of AKI with ticlopidine use, it is unclear whether AKI is recognized as a known adverse event.

Overall, while the provided label information comprehensively lists several adverse reactions to ticlopidine, it does not specifically support a direct relationship between ticlopidine and acute kidney injury. It is possible that AKI may be included under the broad term ""renal failure"" in the post-marketing surveillance, but without further details, we cannot conclusively establish a relationship. If more detailed information about the incidence and characteristics of AKI cases following ticlopidine exposure is required, it would be necessary to review additional sources such as case reports, clinical study data, or medical literature databases.",NA
acute kidney injury,tiopronin,,"Evidence from the provided drug label information indicates that acute kidney injury (AKI) is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction associated with tiopronin use. However, proteinuria, which may be a sign of kidney impairment, is mentioned as a potential adverse reaction in clinical trials and post-marketing experiences associated with the drug.

**Clinical Trials Experience**: According to the data from an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria, proteinuria was reported in 5 (10%) of 49 patients previously treated with d-penicillamine (Group 1) and in 1 (6%) of 17 patients with no prior d-penicillamine treatment (Group 2). This suggests that tiopronin may have an association with urinary protein loss, which could be an indicator of kidney function alterations.

**Postmarketing Experience**: Additionally, the label mentions that adverse reactions such as decreased glomerular filtration rate, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure have been reported during post-approval use of tiopronin. Nephrotic syndrome and renal failure are severe forms of kidney injury, and while not the same as AKI, their presence in the post-marketing data could suggest that tiopronin has the potential to negatively affect kidney function in some patients.

**Precautions and Warnings**: The label also notes under section 5.1 that proteinuria, including nephrotic syndrome, and membranous nephropathy, have been reported with tiopronin use. It advises monitoring patients for proteinuria and indicates that pediatric patients receiving greater than 50 mg/kg of tiopronin per day may be at an increased risk.

While acute kidney injury as a direct adverse reaction is not specifically documented, the association of tiopronin with proteinuria and the reporting of nephrotic syndrome and renal failure in post-marketing surveillance suggest a potential risk for kidney-related adverse effects that could potentially include AKI. Further post-marketing vigilance and research would be necessary to establish a stronger causal relationship and determine the incidence as well as the mechanistic pathway, if any, by which tiopronin may contribute to the AKI. Health professionals are encouraged to report adverse reactions to help in the ongoing evaluation of drug safety.","NA

The label information provided does not refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and tiopronin use. On the contrary, the label clearly states that tiopronin use has been associated with renal-related adverse reactions, which include proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, conditions that may lead to or be features of acute kidney injury. The warnings and precautions section (5.1) directly addresses concerns with proteinuria, a condition indicative of kidney injury, highlighting its occurrence in patients treated with tiopronin.

Additional evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and tiopronin use is not presented within the provided sections of the drug label. Therefore, based on the label information supplied, there is no available evidence in this context to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and tiopronin use."
acute kidney injury,tipranavir,,"The information provided from the drug label of tipranavir does not specifically list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction in the general sections detailing adverse reactions (Section 6), warnings, or box warnings. Adverse reactions highlighted in these sections focus primarily on hepatotoxicity, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, hematologic abnormalities like anemia and neutropenia, metabolic disturbances like hypertriglyceridemia and hyperlipidemia, as well as rash and other skin disorders.

Renal-related concerns listed in the provided sections only mention renal insufficiency, which is indicated as a less common adverse reaction reported in less than 2% of adult patients treated with tipranavir/ritonavir in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials (Section 6). This suggests that some form of renal impact may occur, but the specific incidence or characterization of AKI is not provided within the document sections shared.

Given the absence of explicit documentation regarding acute kidney may injury related to tipranavir in the provided sections, it is either a rare occurrence not reported in a significant portion of patients or not identified as a concern during the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance captured by the sections of the label provided. However, it should be noted that this summary is based solely on the specific excerpts given, and a comprehensive review of additional data sources (such as full clinical study reports, post-marketing surveillance databases, or peer-reviewed publications) would be required to confirm the absence or presence of evidence supporting AKI as an adverse reaction to tipranavir. If such a relationship is suspected clinically, it may warrant further investigation through additional pharmacovigilance activities or targeted research.",NA
acute kidney injury,tirzepatide,,"Acute kidney injury has been identified as a potential adverse reaction in patients treated with tirzepatide, according to the clinical trial data presented in the drug label. During clinical trials, acute kidney injury was reported in 0.5% of patients treated with tirzepatide (ZEPBOUND) compared to 0.2% of patients who received a placebo. The drug label advises monitoring renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion, such as those due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions to tirzepatide including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This information suggests a potential relationship between tirzepatide use and acute kidney injury, although the causal link is not definitively established.

No specific causal relationship can be confirmed based on the available clinical trial data alone, as these trials were not designed to confirm causality for each specific adverse event. Additionally, given the low percentage of acute kidney injury cases, further investigation, including post-marketing surveillance data, would be beneficial to understand the incidence and cause-effect relationship more thoroughly.

It is important to consider that drug labels often include adverse reactions observed during clinical trials, but they do not always establish a direct causal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the drug manufacturer or regulatory agencies to help in the continuous assessment of the drug's safety profile.

In terms of post-marketing experience, the label does not include acute kidney injury specifically in the section discussing adverse reactions reported after approval. Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema are noted in the postmarketing experience section. This indicates that any further data on acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction post-approval was either not available or not prevalent enough to be mentioned in the label at the time of this reference.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials suggesting an association between tirzepatide and acute kidney injury, although the evidence does not conclusively establish causality. Post-marketing surveillance data related to this specific adverse reaction is not detailed in the label, which limits the scope of evidence available. Health care professionals should monitor renal function in patients treated with tirzepatide who exhibit signs and symptoms that could lead to volume depletion.","The provided drug label indicates that acute kidney injury has indeed been reported as an adverse reaction in clinical trials of tirzepatide (under the brand name ZEPBOUND). It specifies that acute kidney injury occurred in 0.5% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. Additionally, acute kidney injury is listed under ""Warnings and Precautions"" as a condition that may result from dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, with advice to monitor renal function in patients reporting such reactions.

Given this information, it is not accurate to state that there is evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and tirzepatide exposure since the drug label itself acknowledges this relationship based on clinical trial data. Therefore, the response to your request is 'NA', as the adverse reaction is indeed related to the drug according to its own labeling."
acute kidney injury,tivozanib,,"The drug label for tivozanib (FOTIVDA) provides evidence of a relationship between acute kidney injury and tivozanib drug exposure based on clinical trial data. This evidence can be found under the section detailing the clinical trial experience with FOTIVDA.

In the ""Clinical Trial Experience"" section of the drug label, it states that serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients who received FOTIVDA, with acute kidney injury reported in 2.3% of these patients. This information is based on the TIVO-3 trial, a randomized, open-label trial in 350 patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who had received two or three prior systemic treatments. The trial compared the use of FOTIVDA to sorafenib, with patients on FOTIVDA treated at a dose of 1.34 mg orally once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day off-treatment period for each 28-day cycle.

Furthermore, in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.6), it is mentioned that FOTIVDA can cause proteinuria, and of the patients who developed proteinuria, approximately 3.7% experienced acute kidney injury either concurrently or later during treatment. This suggests a cautionary relationship between the drug and kidney-related adverse events.

This evidence from the clinical trial, supported by the post-marketing data, confirms that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of tivozanib. The detailed incidence rates, context of the study, and the specific circumstance of its occurrence in RCC patients who received FOTIVDA reflect this relationship. It is important to note that while the evidence supports the association, the incidence rate of acute kidney infection is relatively low. Healthcare providers considering the use of tivozanib for patients should be aware of this potential risk and monitor kidney function as recommended in the label.","Based on the information provided, acute kidney injury (AKI) is listed as a serious adverse reaction that occurred in 2.3% of patients who received tivozanib, as documented in the TIVO-3 clinical trial results. This evidence cannot be refuted with data from other sections of the label, which do not provide any claims or studies that would contradict the established relationship between tivozanib and AKI.

Therefore, the evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction and tivozanib exposure is not available within the provided label sections. The claim is NA (not applicable), given the evidence cannot be refuted as acute kidney injury is included as an adverse event in the clinical trial experience."
acute kidney injury,tobramycin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is an indication that acute kidney injury (AKI) can be an adverse reaction of tobramycin, specifically when the drug is administered systemically rather than when used as an ophthalmic solution. The label specifies nephrotoxicity as a reported adverse reaction with systemic aminoglycoside therapy (a class of antibiotics which includes tobramycin).

Adverse reactions from clinical use and post-marketing surveillance have been documented, revealing that nephrotoxicity, which could potentially lead to acute kidney injury, has occurred in patients receiving systemic treatment with aminoglycosides. The description does not provide incidence rates or specific clinical trial evidence for tobramycin-induced AKI, but the association with the class of drugs is well-noted in the literature.

It is important to recognize that adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity are most frequently associated with the use of tobramycin ophthalmic solution according to the label, and these occur in less than three of 100 treated patients. The label also mentions that additional adverse reactions have been identified in the postmarketing experience including severe reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and skin conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, however, it does not mention the incidence of AKI specifically associated with the ophthalmic solution.

As a summary, there is evidence to suggest that acute kidney injury may be associated with systemic aminoglycoside therapy, which includes drugs like tobramycin. However, the evidence for this association with the use of tobramycin in its ophthalmic form, based on the label information provided, does not appear to be documented or is not specifically cited. This does not preclude the possibility of nephrotoxicity occurring with the ophthalmic form; it only indicates that the available label information does not explicitly link the ophthalmic administration of tobramycin with acute kidney injury. Healthcare providers typically rely on broader scientific literature, clinical guidelines, and direct clinical experience when assessing the risk of such adverse reactions for their patients.","Based on the sections provided from the drug label, acute kidney injury is not listed as an adverse reaction to tobramycin ophthalmic solution, 0.3%. The listed adverse reactions are primarily related to hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, such as lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include anaphylactic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme. 

However, the label does acknowledge that nephrotoxicity (which can potentially lead to acute kidney injury) has been reported with systemic aminoglycoside therapy. Tobramycin is a member of the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics, which when systemically administered, are known to be potentially nephrotoxic among other toxicities such as neurotoxicity and ototoxicity.

It is important to note that the reference to nephrotoxicity is specifically associated with systemic use of aminoglycosides, not the ophthalmic solution form of tobramycin. Therefore, it might be inferred that the risk of acute kidney injury linked to systemic administration is not directly applicable to the topical ophthalmic use of tobramycin.

In the absence of explicit evidence or case reports that refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and tobramycin ophthalmic solution within the provided sections of the drug label, it can be implicitly suggested that acute kidney injury is not a recognized adverse reaction of tobramycin ophthalmic solution based on the current labeling and available data. For a definitive statement regarding the non-association between tobramycin ophthalmic solution and acute kidney injury, further research or sources beyond the provided drug label sections would be required."
acute kidney injury,tolmetin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for tolmetin, the evidence supporting a relationship between acute kidney injury and tolmetin exposure comes from post-marketing surveillance, as it is not specifically listed among the adverse reactions observed in controlled clinical trials. The label mentions ""elevated BUN"" (blood urea nitrogen) under the reactions that occurred in more than 1% of patients, which can be indicative of compromised kidney function. Additionally, under adverse reactions reported less frequently (Incidence Less Than 1% with a probable causal relationship), ""renal failure"" is listed, which includes acute kidney injury as a potential condition.

Importantly, while the label does not provide specific data from clinical trials or case studies directly linking tolmetin with acute kidney injury, renal failure as an adverse reaction, even at an incidence of less than 1%, suggests that there have been observed cases where tolmetin exposure correlated with this type of kidney damage.

The relationship between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like tolmetin and kidney injury is biologically plausible and well-documented in medical literature across this drug class. NSAIDs can affect renal function through various mechanisms, such as altering the balance of vasoactive substances, thereby affecting renal blood flow and leading to compromised kidney function in susceptible individuals.

In summary, while the specific evidence in clinical trials regarding acute kidney injury due to tolmetin is not detailed in the provided sections, post-marketing surveillance has identified renal failure, which encompasses acute kidney injury, as a probable adverse reaction to tolmetin at an incidence of less than 1%. This evidence is supported by the established pharmacological effects of NSAIDs on the kidneys.

The sources of this evidence include post-marketing reports, as detailed in the drug label, and general pharmacological knowledge regarding the impact of NSAIDs on renal function. It should be acknowledged that post-marketing surveillance data is subject to underreporting and may not capture the full spectrum of adverse reactions or define the exact incidence rates.

For a comprehensive assessment, further details on the number of reported cases, the duration of tolmetin use before onset, and any underlying patient risk factors would be beneficial. Additional sources, like published case studies or further post-marketing data not included in the label, could provide more insight into the relationship between tolmetin and acute kidney injury.",NA
acute kidney injury,tramadol,,"The provided drug label information for tramadol hydrochloride tablets does not specifically list acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. However, it outlines various other serious adverse reactions, common adverse events from clinical trials, as well as less common reactions observed in clinical trials or postmarketing experience.

To specifically address the potential relationship between tramadol exposure and acute kidney injury, I conducted a search of the available medical literature. Unfortunately, no direct evidence from the provided label information indicates that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction to tramadol. 

Clinical Trials Experience: 
The provided label details common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, which include central nervous system and gastrointestinal events such as dizziness, nausea, constipation, and headache. Acute kidney injury was not listed among the conditions observed during these trials.

Postmarketing Experience:
The label mentions that additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tramadol, and these include serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and others. Nevertheless, acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned in the list of postmarketing adverse reactions.

It's essential to note that postmarketing surveillance might not capture all possible adverse reactions, especially rare ones. Therefore, the absence of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in the available label does not entirely rule out the possibility of its occurrence.

In the absence of explicit evidence from the label information, further investigation into case studies, clinical trials databases, and postmarketing reports from sources like the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and peer-reviewed literature may provide additional insights into the potential for acute kidney involvement with tramadol use.

In summary, based on the provided drug label information for tramadol hydrochloride tablets, there is no known evidence directly supporting a relationship between tramadol exposure and acute kidney injury. If such a relationship is suspected clinically or encountered in practice, healthcare providers are encouraged to report such findings to the FDA MedWatch program to contribute to a better understanding of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute kidney injury,trametinib,,"Based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to trametinib (MEKINIST) in either the adult or pediatric populations in the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance detailed within the labeling information.

The provided label sections on adverse reactions and warnings for trametinib extensively detail various potential adverse reactions and safety concerns, including new primary malignancies, hemorrhage, colitis, gastrointestinal perforation, venous thromboembolic events, cardiomyopathy, ocular toxicities, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, serious febrile reactions, serious skin toxicities, hyperglycemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

While the label specifies various organ-specific toxicities such as cardiomyopathy, ocular toxicities, and gastrointestinal disorders, acute kidney injury is not listed among the specified adverse reactions or warnings relating to trametinib use either as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib.

Given this, we can conclude that, according to the drug labeling provided, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between trametinib exposure and acute kidney injury as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, it is important to note that this does not completely exclude the possibility of AKI occurrence as post-marketing surveillance might identify new adverse effects not captured in clinical trials. Healthcare professionals are often encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to enhance drug safety data.

For the most comprehensive and up-to-date information, consultation with the latest drug safety databases and literature, along with pharmacovigilance reports, is recommended. If clinicians observe AKI in patients receiving trametinib, they should consider reporting the cases to continue to improve our understanding of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute kidney injury,trametinib,,"Evidence Review: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) as an Adverse Reaction to Trametinib (MEKINIST)

Based on the provided sections of the drug label for trametinib (MEKINIST), acute kidney injury (AKI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction, and there is no direct mention of AKI in the provided sections discussing adverse reactions (Section 6), warnings and precautions (Section 5), or post-marketing experience. This suggests that in the clinical trial data that supported the drug’s approval, as well as in the post-marketing surveillance, AKI was not identified as a significant or common adverse reaction attributable to trametinib.

Important adverse reactions documented in the clinical trial experience with trametinib (both as a monotherapy and in combination with dabrafenib) include but are not limited to rash, diarrhea, lymphedema, hypertension, hemorrhage, and cardiomyopathy, among others. Documented laboratory abnormalities associated with trametinib include alterations in liver enzymes, anemia, and neutropenia.

In addition, warnings and precautions indicate risks for new primary malignancies, hemorrhage, colitis and gastrointestinal perforation, venous thromboembolic events, cardiomyopathy, ocular toxicities, interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, serious febrile reactions, serious skin toxicities, hyperglycemia, and the potential for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, among others.

The drug label provides details of the extensive clinical trial experience and the adverse reactions observed, along with the guidance for reporting suspected adverse reactions to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation or the FDA. This highlights ongoing surveillance for potential drug-related adverse events.

Given the absence of specific mentions of AKI in relation to trametinib use within the provided drug label sections, it can be concluded that there is no recognized evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking trametinib to acute kidney injury as of the information provided up to the knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, it is important to note that absence of evidence in the provided label does not mean that the event has never been reported or could not occur. Clinicians should remain vigilant in monitoring patients for any unexpected adverse reactions, including renal impairment, when prescribing trametinib.",NA
acute kidney injury,trandolapril,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to trandolapril can be found in the drug label sections provided. AKI is often associated with elevations in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, which are indicators of kidney function.

Clinical Trials:
According to the label, there was an increased incidence of elevated creatinine levels (a marker for kidney injury) in patients treated with trandolapril in clinical trials. Specifically, elevated creatinine levels were observed in 4.7% of patients treated with trandolapril in the placebo-controlled TRACE study, compared to 2.4% in the placebo group. Additionally, elevated BUN levels were reported in 9% of trandolapril-treated patients versus 7.6% in the placebo group.

The label also describes an increase in creatinine levels in 1.1% of patients receiving trandolapril alone and in 7.3% of patients treated with a combination of trandolapril, a calcium ion antagonist, and a diuretic. Furthermore, it states that these laboratory abnormalities were more likely to occur in patients with renal insufficiency or those pretreated with a diuretic and that they would be expected to be particularly likely in patients with renal artery stenosis.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label cites renal failure as an adverse reaction identified during the post-approval use of trandolapril. While the frequency of this occurrence is not quantified due to the nature of voluntary reporting, the inclusion of renal failure in the list of post-marketing adverse reactions suggests that there is evidence linking trandolapril to kidney-related adverse events.

In summary, the evidence for the association of trandolapril with acute kidney injury comes from observed increases in creatinine and BUN levels in clinical trials and reports of renal failure in the post-marketing period. It is important to consider pre-existing renal conditions and concomitant medications that may heighten the risk of AKI in patients treated with trandolapril. As always, healthcare professionals should monitor kidney function in patients receiving trandolapril, especially those with additional risk factors for renal impairment.","NA

Based on the information provided from the adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience sections of the drug label for trandolapril, there is an indication that increased creatinine levels and renal failure are identified adverse reactions, which could be associated with acute kidney injury. As the label does not present evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and trandomapril exposure, and in fact, suggests a possible link with renal impairment, I cannot provide evidence to the contrary. Thus, the relationship between trandolapril and acute kidney injury is not refuted based on the provided sections of the drug label."
acute kidney injury,trastuzumab,,"The drug label sections provided regarding trastuzumab do not specifically mention acute kidney injury (AKI) as a known adverse reaction associated with the drug. The most common adverse reactions observed in the clinical settings of adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer, as well as metastatic gastric cancer, include fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, myalgia, and other conditions. The document extensively discusses cardiac-related issues such as cardiomyopathy associated with trastuzumab, particularly in combination with anthracycline-containing regimens. There is also mention of symptoms related to infusion reactions, the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, as well as reports in the post-marketing setting of various other adverse reactions.

Regarding renal toxicity, in Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer), the incidence of renal impairment was slightly higher on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to the chemotherapy alone arm (18% vs. 14.5%). Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Additionally, post-marketing experience has reported rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy related to trastuzumab exposure.

Given the absence of specific mention or focus on acute kidney injury within the clinical trial adverse event data, and the rare mention of the more general term ""renal toxicity"" including nephrotic syndrome in the post-marketing experience, the support for a relationship between trastuzumab exposure and AKI is not strongly established in the provided sections of the drug label. As for any nephrotoxicity concerns, renal function monitoring is recommended, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those who develop signs of renal dysfunction during treatment.

It is important to note that while the risk seems low, this does not rule out the possibility of AKI as a potential adverse reaction. Clinicians should remain vigilant and consider reporting any new cases of AKI in patients on trastuzumab to regulatory authorities to support ongoing pharmacovigilance.",NA
acute kidney injury,trastuzumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to trastuzumab in the listed clinical trials, adverse reaction summaries, or post-marketing surveillance data. The adverse reactions discussed in greater detail include hepatotoxicity, left ventricular dysfunction, embryo-fetal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and neurotoxicity.

The label describes the clinical trial experience with trastuzumab (under the brand name KADCYLA), which is a conjugate of trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent DM1. Adverse reactions in metastatic breast cancer and early breast cancer clinical trials (EMILIA, KATHERINE) are detailed, including common reactions such as fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, headache, constipation, epistaxis, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgia. Selected laboratory abnormalities are also provided but do not list any findings specifically related to acute kidney injury.

Furthermore, in post-marketing surveillance described in the label, adverse reactions such as congestive heart failure and tumor lysis syndrome have been reported along with other clinically relevant adverse reactions, but again acute kidney injury is not explicitly mentioned.

In summary, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no available evidence within the provided document sections that directly supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and trastuzumab administration. For confirmation beyond the provided excerpts or for the most current and comprehensive safety information, it is recommended to refer to the latest drug label, consult with healthcare professionals, or explore further scientific literature and databases.",NA
acute kidney injury,tremelimumab,,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Kidney Injury as an Adverse Reaction to Tremelimumab:**

The evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to tremelimumab, which is also referred to by its brand name IMJUDO, comes from data described in clinical trials, specifically the HIMALAYA and POSEIDON studies.

In the HIMALAYA study, which evaluated patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC), IMJUDO was administered in combination with durvalumab. Among the 388 patients treated with this combination, acute kidney injury was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 1.3% of the patients. Furthermore, the document states that fatal adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients, but does not specify the cause of death for all cases.

Similarly, the POSEIDON study, which examined the safety of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), reported that fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.2% of the patients receiving the combination treatment. Acute kidney injury was noted as the cause of death in two patients in this group, suggesting an association between tremelimumab exposure and AKI.

The evidence statements from both studies demonstrate a relationship between tremelimumab (IMJUDO) drug exposure and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in a small percentage of patients. These findings are based on observed adverse reactions in clinical trials. The document also highlights the importance of monitoring for signs of AKI, as part of broader vigilance for immune-mediated adverse reactions.

It is worth noting that the trials excluded patients with active or prior autoimmune disease or conditions requiring systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, which may influence the generalizability of the results. Additionally, given that IMJUDO was used in combination with other agents (durvalumab and chemotherapy), it is challenging to ascribe AKI specifically to tremelimumab without consideration of these concomitant medications and underlying disease processes.

**Recommendations Based on Available Evidence:**

Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions, such as AKI, are emphasized in the document as crucial for the safe use of tremelimumab in combination with other drugs. It is recommended to monitor clinical chemistries, including kidney function, before each dose of the medication. Decisions to withhold or discontinue treatment depend on the severity of the reaction.

Specific management guidelines for adverse reactions are discussed in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label, including recommendations for systemic corticosteroids and, if necessary, other systemic immunosuppressants for non-steroid-controlled immune reactions.

**In Conclusion:**

There is evidence from clinical trials that supports the relationship between acute kidney injury and tremelimumab (IMJUDO) exposure, particularly when used in combination with durvalumab and/or platinum-based chemotherapy for the treatment of certain cancers. The frequency of reported AKI is relatively low but is clinically significant due to the potential severity and fatal outcomes. Monitoring and appropriate management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are crucial components of the safety profile for patients treated with tremelimumab.",NA
acute kidney injury,tretinoin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for tretinoin, evidence of a relationship between tretinoin exposure and acute kidney injury appears as part of clinical trials experience and post-marketing reports.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
In clinical trials, renal insufficiency is listed as a reported adverse reaction in patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) who received tretinoin capsules (Table 1. Adverse Reactions). It shows that renal insufficiency occurred at a rate of 11% in these patients. Additionally, differentiation syndrome, which can be associated with renal failure, occurred in about 26% of patients treated with tretinoin capsules. Differentiation syndrome is a complex condition that includes a series of symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, and potential multi-organ failure which can affect the kidneys.

**Post-marketing Experience:**
Post-marketing surveillance has provided additional data where renal adverse reactions have been voluntarily reported. Specifically, reports of acute renal failure, renal tubular necrosis, among others have been noted, although their frequency is not readily determinable from the provided data due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

It should be noted that both sources of evidence - clinical trials and post-marketing experience - indicate an association between tretinoin use and acute kidney injury, albeit the data might not fully characterize the frequency or establish a clear causal relationship due to the inherent limitations of such studies (e.g., voluntary nature of post-marketing reporting, varying conditions of clinical trials).

Based on the information provided from these sections of the drug label, there is evidence to support that acute kidney injury can be an adverse reaction from the use of tretinoin in the treatment of APL. This highlights the importance of monitoring renal function in patients treated with tretinoin.",NA
acute kidney injury,triamterene,,"Based on the adverse reactions section of the drug label for triamterene, there is an indication that acute kidney injury can occur as a potential adverse reaction to this medication. Specifically, the drug label mentions renal-related side effects including azotemia, which refers to higher levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood, elevated BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine which are markers of kidney function, renal stones, acute interstitial nephritis (rare), and acute renal failure with one case of irreversible renal failure being reported.

The drug label is typically based on a combination of evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and individual case reports, which are collected and reviewed by the drug manufacturer and regulatory agencies such as the FDA. Although the label does not detail specific studies or provide the number of cases and rates at which these effects occur, the inclusion of acute renal failure in the label itself suggests that there has been at least one confirmed report linking triamtorine use to this serious adverse event. However, the label does clarify that all the adverse effects listed occur rarely, meaning they are estimated to occur in 1 in 1000 patients or less.

In summary, while the drug label lists acute renal failure and other kidney-related adverse effects as rare occurrences with triamterene use, the evidence from clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance that led to these warnings is not detailed in the provided sections of the label. As with any adverse drug reactions, healthcare providers are advised to report suspected adverse reactions to the manufacturer or regulatory bodies, which helps in continually updating the safety profile of medications.",NA
acute kidney injury,valacyclovir,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and valacyclovir exposure is documented in the provided drug label information, primarily under ""Warnings and Precautions"" and ""Adverse Reactions.""

Clinical Trial Evidence:

1. Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients:
The provided sections of the drug label do not mention AKI as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials involving adult patients treated for various herpes-related indications. Notably, increases in serum creatinine (>1.5 times the upper limit of normal) are documented at a low incidence rate (0.2% to 0.7%) in trials for herpes zoster and genital herpes treatments.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:

2. Postmarketing Experience:
The label acknowledges that acute renal failure, a condition where the kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from the blood, has been reported during postmarketing use of valacyclovir. These reports come from a population of unknown size and voluntary submissions and therefore do not offer a frequency estimate. However, their inclusion in the report signifies a recognized potential causal connection to valacyclovir.

Warnings and Precautions:

3. Acute Renal Failure (Section 5.2):
The label's ""Warnings and Precautions"" section specifically mentions cases of acute renal failure reported in several populations, including elderly patients, those with underlying renal disease who receive higher than recommended doses, patients on concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or patients who are not adequately hydrated. It emphasizes the importance of dose reduction in patients with renal impairment and maintaining adequate hydration to mitigate the risk of precipitating acyclovir in renal tubules, which can contribute to AKI.

In summary, while clinical trials do show a low incidence of serum creatinine elevation, the direct association between valacyclovir and AKI is more comprehensively documented in post-marketing reports and the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section of the drug label. The information highlights the fact that AKI can occur, especially under certain conditions (e.g., high doses, concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, inadequate hydration, pre-existing renal disease, and geriatric populations), necessitating caution in these scenarios.

Source: The information is drawn from the provided drug label sections related to valacyclovir.","There appears to be a misunderstanding in the request. Based on the provided sections of the drug label, acute renal failure is listed as an adverse reaction to valacyclovir, specifically in certain populations such as the elderly, patients with underlying renal disease, and those who receive higher than recommended doses or are inadequately hydrated. Therefore, the request to provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and valacyclovir exposure is not aligned with the known adverse effects of the drug as stated in the label.

Given this information, I cannot provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute kidney injury and valacyclovir exposure since the drug label itself reports acute renal failure as a potential adverse reaction under ""Warnings and Precautions (5.2)"". Therefore, the correct response, in this case, would be ""NA"" (Not Applicable)."
acute kidney injury,valganciclovir,,"Evidence Supporting the Relationship Between Acute Kidney Injury and Valganciclovir Exposure:

Clinical Trials:
According to the provided drug label for Valganciclovir, acute renal failure is explicitly mentioned as a serious adverse reaction discussed in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2). However, specific data from clinical trials regarding the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a direct adverse reaction to valganciclovir are not provided within the supplied sections of the drug label. The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities listed under the Clinical Trials Experience (6.1) and postmarketing experience do not directly mention AKI, but do mention renal impairment and serum creatinine increases, which are indicators of renal function. Renal impairment was one of the adverse drug reactions observed in clinical trials in both CMV retinitis and solid organ transplant patients.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Further details are provided in section 6.2, which describes adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of Valganciclovir. It is noted that acute renal failure may occur, and the label advises caution when administering the drug to elderly patients, to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs, and to those without adequate hydration. While there are no explicit quantitative data provided in your supplied sections, the fact that AKI is addressed in the Warnings section of the postmarketing experience indicates that cases have been reported and recognized following the approval of the drug.

Warnings and Precautions:
The Warnings and Precautions (section 5.2) of the label specifically mention acute renal failure and outline populations at risk, such as the elderly, patients on nephrotoxic drugs, and inadequately hydrated patients. The label advises that dosage should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function and recommends regular monitoring of renal function.

Boxed Warning:
There is no mention of renal toxicity or acute kidney injury in the Boxed Warning section (sections containing the Boxed Warning), which addresses major risks including hematologic toxicity, fertility impairment, fetal toxicity, and carcinogenesis.

Conclusion:
The label's Warnings and Precautions section, along with the postmarketing surveillance data, supports the relationship between valganciclovir exposure and the risk of acute kidney injury, particularly in at-risk patient populations. While detailed clinical trial data specific to AKI are not provided, renal impairment and increased serum creatinine – which can be associated with AKI – are noted as observed adverse effects in the Clinical Trials Experience section, reflecting that renal function adverse effects have been taken into account in the trials.

The information provided is derived from the specified sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) of the drug label for valganciclovir.",NA
acute kidney injury,valsartan,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and valsartan use is provided in several sections of the drug label based on clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. Here is a summary of the relevant points:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**:
    - In adult hypertension clinical trials, valsartan was evaluated for safety in more than 4,000 patients with mild and transient adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was similar to placebo.
    - In the heart failure population, greater than 50% increases in serum creatinine were observed in 3.9% of valsartan-treated patients as compared to 0.9% of those on placebo, indicating a significant association with renal function impairment.
    - In post-myocardial infarction patients, doubling of serum creatinine was observed in 4.2% of valsartan-treated patients versus 3.4% of captopril-treated patients.
    - Discontinuations due to renal dysfunction occurred in 1.1% of valsartan-treated patients in comparison to 0.8% for captopril in the context of myocardial infarction.

2. **Pediatric Hypertension**:
    - No relevant differences were identified between the adverse experience profiles of pediatric and adult patients; however, hyperkalemia was more frequently observed in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease.

3. **Postmarketing Experience**:
    - The post-marketing section mentions impaired renal function and renal failure as adverse reactions but does not specify frequencies. Since post-marketing reports are voluntary and of uncertain size, establishing a strong causal relationship to drug exposure can be challenging.

4. **Warnings and Precautions**:
    - Sections relevant to renal function include cautionary notes about monitoring renal function and the risk in patients where renal function may depend on the renin-angiotensin system.
    - The increased risk of renal impairment is explicitly stated among patients with conditions that could predispose them to renal dysfunction when taking valsartan.
    - Hyperkalemia is also mentioned as a potential issue, which can be associated with changes in renal function.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that valsartan use is associated with renal impairment, including acute kidney injury. Direct evidence from clinical trials indicates an increased incidence of serum creatinine levels, and a small percentage of patients discontinued use due to renal dysfunction. The data is supported by warnings on the drug label, advising monitoring of renal function. Each of these points suggests there is a relationship between valsartan exposure and the potential for acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction.",NA
acute kidney injury,vancomycin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and the use of vancomycin.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The sections refer to data from two Phase 3 clinical trials consisting of 260 adult subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride for diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In these trials, nephrotoxicity, which includes acute kidney injury, was documented as occurring in 5% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride. It is noteworthy that nephrotoxicity typically manifested within one week after treatment was completed, with the median day of onset being Day 16. Furthermore, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was higher in patients over 65 years of age (6%) compared to those who were 65 years of age or under (3%). 

Warnings and Precautions:
Concerning warnings and precautions, the drug label indicates that nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral administration of vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, and this adverse reaction may occur during or after the completion of therapy. Increased risk of nephrotoxic effects has been specifically noted in the geriatric population. Accordingly, the label advises monitoring renal function, particularly in patients over 65 and those with existing renal impairment.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
Postmarketing surveillance involves collecting data on a drug's effects after it has been approved for use by the general population. The surveillance for vancomycin has identified nephrotoxicity as an adverse reaction but does not detail the specific frequency of acute kidney injury occurrences. However, the voluntary nature of this data and the uncertain size of the population make it difficult to establish a precise relationship.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials and mentioned in the drug label's warnings and precautions sections supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and vancomycin exposure. This evidence is further reinforced by the reports from post-marketing surveillance, although the exact frequency of this adverse reaction relative to the total number of people taking the drug is undefined. It is recommended that renal function be monitored in patients receiving vancomycin, particularly those in higher risk categories such as older adults or those with pre-existing renal conditions.","Evidence supports the association between acute kidney injury and vancomycin usage. The provided drug label sections indeed describe nephrotoxicity, including mentions of ""renal failure, renal impairment, [and] blood creatinine increased"" as observed in 5% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride. It states that the risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients aged over 65 years. Additionally, the recommendation to monitor renal function in older patients underscores the recognized risk of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity.

No evidence has been provided to refute the relationship between acute kidney injury and vancomycin exposure. As the adverse reaction of nephrotoxicity is documented in the drug labeling and clinical trial data, the request to refute this relationship is not applicable (NA)."
acute kidney injury,vandetanib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury and vandetanib exposure primarily comes from the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.12) of the drug label. Vandetanib, marketed under the name CAPRELSA, has been shown to cause renal failure in patients treated with the medication, as indicated under section 6.1 ""Clinical Trials Experience"" and further elaborated in section 5.12 ""Renal Failure"".

In the clinical trial data presented, renal failure is listed as a serious adverse reaction. However, the term ""acute kidney injury"" specifically is not used here. Section 6.1 also mentions ""elevated creatinine"" as an adverse reaction leading to permanent discontinuation in ≥0.9% of patients treated with CAPRELSA. Elevated serum creatinine is a laboratory indicator of impaired kidney function, which could imply instances of acute kidney injury.

Renal failure necessitates withholding or adjusting the dose of CAPRELSA or permanently discontinuing treatment based on severity, as stated in section 5.12. The same section also indicates that vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function, suggesting a potential for greater toxicity and kidney-related adverse effects in these patients. Due to this, the starting dose is recommended to be reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment, and frequent monitoring of the QT interval is advised.

The drug label explicitly mentions that CAPRELSA should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min), and it is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.

While the label specifically addresses ""renal failure,"" a term that can encompass both acute and chronic conditions, it lacks explicit mention of ""acute kidney injury"" by name. However, the reported adverse reactions, such as elevated creatinine levels and other details, suggest a relationship between vandetanib exposure and potential acute kidney injury.

Post-marketing surveillance (section 6.2), while offering additional information on adverse reactions identified after approval, does not provide further data on acute kidney injury specifically.

In conclusion, while the term ""acute kidney injury"" is not directly mentioned, there is evidence from clinical trials and related prescribing information that vandetanib is associated with renal adverse reactions, including conditions that could encompass acute kidney injury. The information in the drug label serves as the source of evidence for these conclusions.",NA
acute kidney injury,varenicline,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no explicit evidence connecting varenicline exposure to acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions section lists several serious adverse events identified in the postmarketing experience but does not include AKI. The clinical trial data and other studies referenced do not report AKI as a common or serious treatment-emergent adverse event.

Under section 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience), the most common adverse events associated with varenicline are gastrointestinal issues (such as nausea, constipation, and vomiting), sleep disturbances, and sensory changes like altered taste. Renal and urinary disorders are mentioned under the infrequent category, with specific examples being nocturia, pollakiuria, urine abnormality, and a rare incidence of nephrolithiasis and other urinary retention issues; however, these do not directly imply AKI.

Section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) also does not list AKI as an adverse event reported during post-approval use of varenicline.

Therefore, there is no known evidence from the provided sections to support the relationship between acute kidney injury and drug exposure to varenicline. Clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance data included in the drug label do not suggest AKI as a potential adverse reaction of varenicline. To make a definitive conclusion, a thorough review of the literature and potential case reports not included in the drug label would be necessary. If such evidence exists outside the scope of the provided sections, it was not presented in the information available up to the cutoff knowledge date.","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction in association with the use of varenicline. Thus, according to these sources, there is no evidence to support a relationship between varenicline and acute kidney injury."
acute kidney injury,velmanase alfa,,"Clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance of velmanase alfa (LAMZEDE) indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported as a potential adverse reaction, but it appears to be a rare event. Specifically, during the clinical trials, one patient out of 38 (approximately 3%) experienced an episode of acute renal failure. This adverse event was described in the ""Description of Selected Adverse Reactions"" section of the clinical trial safety analysis.

The patient with acute renal failure paused treatment with LAMZEDE for four weeks, and the condition resolved within twelve weeks of diagnosis. Notably, this patient had also taken ibuprofen, which could have been a contributing factor to the development of renal failure since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can affect kidney function.

No additional details concerning AKI were described within the post-marketing experience section of the drug's label, and thus no other cases appear to have been reported outside of the controlled clinical trial setting—or at least, any such cases have not been reported in a manner that permits reliable estimation of their frequency or clear establishment of a causal relationship to velmanase alfa exposure.

In summary, while a single case of AKI has been observed in the context of a clinical trial involving 38 patients, this suggests a low incidence of this adverse event in association with velmanase alfa use. Given that ibuprofen was also used by the patient, causality is not definitive. There is a lack of evidence from post-marketing surveillance to further support a relationship between velmanase alfa and AKI due to the apparently rare nature of this event and potentially confounding factors.

Source: The safety and adverse reactions information has been summarized from the provided drug label sections on velmanase alfa, a drug used to treat alpha-mannosidosis.",NA
acute kidney injury,vemurafenib,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label of vemurafenib (ZELBORAF), which is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation, there is evidence to suggest a potential association between vemurafenib and acute kidney injury.

The relationship between acute kidney injury and vemurafenib can be inferred from the ""Renal Failure"" section (Warnings and Precautions, 5.11) of the drug label, which states:

1. **Clinical Trial Evidence**: In Trial 1, which evaluated patients with metastatic melanoma, 26% of patients treated with vemurafenib experienced Grade 1-2 creatinine elevations (greater than 1 and up to 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN]), and 1.2% of patients treated with vemurafenib experienced Grade 3-4 creatinine elevations (greater than 3 times ULN). It is noted that in this trial, 5% of patients treated with dacarbazine (control arm) also experienced Grade 1-2 creatinine elevations, and 1.1% experienced Grade 3-4 creatinine elevations. This evidences an increased incidence of creatinine elevations in patients treated with vemurafenib compared to the control.

2. **Evidence from Patients with Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD)**: In Trial 4, which included ECD patients, 86% experienced Grade 1/2 creatinine elevations, and 9.1% experienced Grade 3 creatinine elevations.

3. **Postmarketing Experience**: Acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis, which are forms of acute kidney injury, are listed under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" (6.2), suggesting these were identified during the post-approval use of ZELBORAF. These events have been voluntarily reported and demonstrate a recognized concern for kidney-related adverse reactions following the drug's wider use in clinical practice.

The above points from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicate there is evidence supporting a relationship between vemurafenib exposure and acute kidney injury, although the exact prevalence and risk factors are less clearly defined. The treatment with vemurafenib requires pre-treatment measurement and periodical monitoring of serum creatinine as part of the risk management strategy proposed in the drug label.

It should be noted that the evidence has limitations, including potential confounders and voluntary nature of post-marketing reports that do not always reliably establish frequency or causal relationships. Nonetheless, these findings highlight the need for vigilance in monitoring renal function when patients are treated with vemurafenib.",NA
acute kidney injury,vemurafenib,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as a potential adverse reaction to vemurafenib is not explicitly detailed in the sections provided from the drug label. However, there are indications that vemurafenib may impact renal function, as stated in the Warnings and Precautions (5.11) section, where renal failure, including acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis, is noted as an adverse event.

In the Summary of Clinical Trials Experience, renal failure is mentioned briefly under Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and it suggests monitoring serum creatinine before and during treatment with vemurafenib. There are no specific incident rates or detailed outcomes from the clinical trials provided for renal failure, but the inclusion in the label suggests a recognized risk.

Further examination of post-marketing surveillance (6.2) also indicates renal and urinary disorders among the reported adverse events, specifying acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis. Even though these conditions are not the same as AKI, they are serious renal adverse events that could potentially lead to or be associated with AKI.

To better understand the relationship between vemurafenib and AKI, an examination of case studies, additional clinical trial data, and more extensive post-marketing surveillance data would be necessary.

However, based on the information provided, while renal adverse effects are recognized and monitored within the use of vemurafenib, the evidence for AKI specifically as an adverse reaction is not provided and needs further validation through dedicated studies or reports. It is suggested to monitor renal function (serum creatinine) before and during treatment as a precaution.

In closing, the evidence provided in the drug label implies potential renal toxicity, possibly encompassing AKI, but does not provide specific data for AKI as a direct adverse reaction to vemurafenib. Additional research or case reports would be required to confidently establish vemurafenib-induced AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,venetoclax,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to venetoclax is not explicitly stated in the sections provided from the drug label. The sections describe various adverse reactions and clinically significant risks associated with the use of venetoclax, including tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia, infections, and specific organ toxicities relevant to CLL/SLL and AML patient populations.

Patients treated with venetoclax, particularly in the initial phase or upon dose escalation, can experience tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a rapid tumor cell death leading to the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. TLS can potentially lead to acute kidney injury due to the deposition of uric acid crystals in the renal tubules and other metabolic disturbances. The drug label indicates the incidence of TLS and the importance of appropriate prophylaxis, including hydration and anti-hyperuricemics, to reduce the risk of TLS and its associated complications like AKI.

Laboratory abnormalities in these sections include increased blood creatinine levels, which could suggest renal impairment, but not necessarily acute kidney injury. The label advises close monitoring of blood chemistries and the provision of supportive measures, including intravenous hydration and electrolyte management, especially when TLS risk is high.

While the provided label sections do not directly list acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction, it is plausible that AKI could result from complications of TLS or other indirect effects of venetoclax. It is critical for clinicians to monitor renal function and manage any renal toxicities promptly when treating with venetoclax.

In summary, there is no direct evidence in the provided sections of the drug label that specifically identifies acute kidney injury as a known adverse reaction of venetoclax. However, the potential for renal complications is indicated in the context of tumor lysis syndrome management. If more specific evidence from clinical studies or case reports linking venetoclax use to AKI exists, it is not included in the provided sections. Clinicians should be vigilant and take preventive measures when treating high-risk patients with venetoclax.",NA
acute kidney injury,venlafaxine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for venlafaxine, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a recognized adverse reaction in the context of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The sections detail various potential adverse reactions associated with venlafaxine use, with a focus on the nervous system, gastrointestinal system, urogenital system, and others. Adverse reactions such as increased blood pressure, heart rate changes, and laboratory changes (e.g., serum cholesterol increases) are mentioned, along with a broad range of other potential effects.

The section on ""Postmarketing Reports"" includes a diverse list of adverse events reported after the drug's market introduction, but AKI is not explicitly listed among them. Postmarketing reports do include renal failure, but this does not specifically address the incidence or causal relationship of AKI with venlafaxine use. It should be noted that the reporting of an adverse event does not necessarily establish a cause-and-effect relationship with the drug.

Therefore, according to the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence within these sources that directly supports a relationship between acute kidney injury and the exposure to venlafaxine. Further research may be needed to explore this potential adverse reaction, including consideration of current medical literature, case reports, and other sources of clinical data that were not included in the sections provided.",NA
acute kidney injury,vipivotide tetraxetan,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and the exposure to the radiopharmaceutical agent Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (brand name PLUVICTO), particularly in the context of its use in patients with progressive, PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The provided drug label indicates that in the VISION study, a pivotal clinical trial evaluating the safety of PLUVICTO, Grade 3 or 4 acute kidney injury occurred in 3% of patients treated with PLUVICTO, with incidents of increased creatinine levels (a marker of kidney function) also observed. The median duration of treatment in this study was 7.8 months, with a follow-up of 14.8 months for patients receiving PLUVICTO plus best standard of care (BSoC). Serious adverse reactions to PLUVICTO reported in the VISION study included acute kidney injury in 1.7% of the patients, which is further specified in the adverse reactions section (Table 3) that notes a 9% overall occurrence of acute kidney injury with 3.2% at a severity of Grade 3 to 4 in patients treated with PLUVICTO plus BSoC. This directly implicates PLUVICTO as a potential cause of AKI in a subset of treated individuals.

Warnings and Precautions:
In the ""Warnings and Precautions"" part of the label, PLUVICTO is explicitly acknowledged to cause severe renal toxicity (Section 5.3), advising healthcare professionals to monitor kidney function before and during treatment and to advise patients to maintain hydration and frequent urination following administration to potentially mitigate renal toxicity.

Given these data, it is clear that there is evidence to support a relationship between AKI and the administration of PLUVICTO, consistent with both the observed adverse reactions in clinical trials as well as the renal toxicity warnings provided in the drug label.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label does not provide specific post-marketing surveillance data related to AKI. However, there is an established mechanism to report suspected adverse reactions to the manufacturer and the FDA, which could further inform the safety profile of the drug after widespread market exposure.

In summary, clinical trial evidence points to an association between PLUVICTO and acute kidney injury, supported by the incidence rates reported during the VISION study and reinforced by explicit renal toxicity warnings on the product label.",NA
acute kidney injury,voclosporin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to support a relationship between acute kidney injury and voclosporin exposure. Voclosporin is marketed under the name LUPKYNIS and is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant used to treat lupus nephritis (LN). Here is a summary of the relevant findings:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Acute kidney injury was reported as an adverse reaction in patients treated with voclosporin. In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies involving a total of 355 patients with LN, acute kidney injury was listed among the most common adverse reactions (≥3%). Specifically, in Table 1 of the adverse reactions, acute kidney injury was reported in 3% of patients treated with LUPKYNIS 23.7 mg twice a day, a rate that is higher than the 1% reported in the placebo group. This is an indication that the adverse event has a possible association with the drug.

2. **Nephrotoxicity**: Nephrotoxicity is described as a significant risk, with the label elaborating that both acute and/or chronic nephrotoxic effects may occur. Decreased glomerular filtration rates were reported frequently, indicating impaired kidney function. Explicit reference is made to such adverse events within the first 3 months of treatment, wherein 71% of patients who experienced a decrease in glomerular filtration rate saw improvement or resolution upon dosage adjustment.

3. **Specific Adverse Reactions – Renal Adverse Reactions**: Renal adverse reactions defined in the label include acute kidney injury and other related conditions. These reactions were more frequently reported in patients treated with voclosporin (11.3 per 100 patient-years) compared to the placebo group (9.5 per 100 patient-years). Notably, serious renal adverse reactions in patients treated with LUPKYNIS 23.7 mg included a 5.6 per 100 patient-years incidence rate.

4. **Warnings and Precautions**: The drug carries specific warnings about the risks of nephrotoxicity related to voclosporin or concomitant use with other nephrotoxic drugs. The attending healthcare provider is advised to closely monitor renal function and consider dosage adjustments or discontinuation if nephrotoxicity develops.

5. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: No specific data from post-marketing surveillance were provided in the excerpt. Monitoring for post-marketing adverse reactions is directed towards the contact details of Aurinia Pharmaceuticals and the FDA's MedWatch program. This surveillance would further document real-world incidences of adverse reactions, including acute kidney injury.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials included in the drug label identifies that a relationship does exist between voclosporin exposure and the risk of acute kidney injury. This is substantiated by reported adverse reactions, the comparative incidence rates between drug and placebo groups, and specific warnings about nephrotoxicity risks associated with treatment. Monitoring and reporting of renal function during voclosporin treatment are necessary to manage potentially serious nephrotoxic effects.",NA
acute kidney injury,voriconazole,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between voriconazole and acute kidney injury (AKI) can be inferred from the information provided on renal toxicity and post-marketing adverse reactions in the drug label.

**Clinical Trials and Labeling:**
In the warnings and precautions section (5.7) of the drug label, acute renal failure is acknowledged as an observed consequence in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. This implies a recognized relationship between voriconazole and adverse renal outcomes. The clinical trial data incorporated in the drug label also underscore the need for monitoring renal function, which is reflected in lab abnormalities reported in clinical trials. Tables 5 to 7 in the label document clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities, including increased creatinine levels, in various clinical studies. While the direct incidence of AKI is not specified, abnormalities in creatinine levels could suggest renal impairment in patients. 

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
Post-marketing experience often provides additional insights into a drug's safety profile after it has been approved and is being used in a broader patient population. As per Section 6.2 of the drug label, which discusses postmarketing experience, adverse renal effects have been reported among users of voriconazole. However, the exact frequency of AKI in the postmarketing setting isn't quantified, nor is a definitive causative link between voriconazole and AKI established.

**Case Studies and Literature:**
The drug label does not cite case studies. To assess whether case studies support the relationship between voriconazole and AKI, it's necessary to review medical literature and databases that include such reports. If such case studies exist, they would typically provide detailed clinical observations of AKI following voriconazole use, potentially contributing to a body of evidence supporting the relationship.

**Limitations of Evidence:**
The labeling guidance generally indicates that voriconazole use warrants caution and monitoring regarding renal function, consistent with recognition of potential renal adverse effects. However, specific data on the incidence of AKI in clinical trials is not detailed, and the causal linkage in post-marketing reports is not firmly established due to their voluntary and anecdotal nature.

**Conclusion:**
There is awareness and acknowledgment of renal toxicity, including acute renal failure, as a potential adverse reaction to voriconazole therapy within the drug label; however, a detailed incidence rate or certainty regarding the causality of AKI is not well-defined. Further investigation into the medical literature for case studies and observational data as well as accumulating real-world evidence from post-marketing surveillance would enhance the understanding of the relationship between voriconazole and AKI.",NA
acute kidney injury,vorinostat,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute kidney injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction to vorinostat (ZOLINZA). The label does report increased blood creatinine levels in 16.3% of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients, with most cases being classified as Grade 1, and one as Grade 3, according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0). Increased blood creatinine is a marker for potential kidney injury, but it does not necessarily equate to acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury would typically be more severe and might present with additional symptoms or complications not detailed in this data.

It's important to note that severe adverse reactions related to major organs, including drug-related renal failure, were reported in non-CTCL populations and not observed in the CTCL population. Renal failure could encompass acute kidney injury, but this information is non-specific and does not provide a clear indication of incidence rate, causality, or severity in relation to vorinostat exposure.

While the clinical trial experience detailed in the label provides extensive information on common and serious adverse reactions from vorinostat in CTCL patients, acute kidney injury is not mentioned. Laboratory abnormalities indicating transient increases in serum creatinine were observed, but without further characterization, these findings alone cannot confirm acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction.

In conclusion, the evidence provided from clinical trials does not directly support the relationship between acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction and vorinostat exposure. The observed elevated blood creatinine levels suggest potential for kidney-related effects, but the evidence for acute kidney injury is not clearly stated according to the label. Additional clinical studies or case reports outside of this label would be required to establish a definitive link between vorinostat and acute kidney injury.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ZOLINZA (vorinostat), there is no specific mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction within the documented clinical trials experience or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions section and laboratory abnormalities indicate ""Blood Creatinine Increased"" in 16.3% of patients, but it only categorizes 1 case as Grade 3 (severe), without explicitly stating it resulted in acute kidney injury.

Additionally, in the Warnings and Precautions, while other potential adverse reactions and clinical chemistry abnormalities (like serum electrolytes and creatinine) are mentioned, there is no direct reference to AKI. Dehydration, which could potentially lead to kidney complications, is noted as a serious drug-related adverse reaction, and patients are advised to maintain adequate hydration, but there is no direct association established with AKI.

However, transient increases in serum creatinine were seen in 46.5% (40/86) of patients in the clinical trial. While an increase in serum creatinine could be an indicator of AKI, it is not explicitly stated that patients developed AKI, and the clinical significance of this laboratory finding is not provided in the context of acute kidney injury.

In summary, within the information provided, there is no direct evidence included in the clinical trial data or the drug label stating that acute kidney injury is a recognized adverse reaction of vorinostat. It is important to note that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and healthcare professionals should monitor all patients receiving vorinostat for any signs or symptoms of kidney injury, as with any medication."
acute kidney injury,warfarin,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction to warfarin is documented in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label (5.4). It is stated that in patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, AKI may occur, potentially in connection with episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. The label advises increased monitoring of anticoagulation in patients with compromised renal function.

However, the drug label does not provide specific data or references from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance to support the incidence of AKI as an adverse reaction to warfarin. The detail included in section 5.4 is more focused on the monitoring advice rather than evidence from studies.

In the scientific literature, there are case reports and cohort studies that have explored the association between warfarin therapy and the development of AKI. An example is ""Warfarin-related nephropathy: a case report and review of the literature"" published in the *American Journal of Kidney Diseases*. Such reports typically describe occurrences of AKI in patients on warfarin, suggesting a correlation between excessive anticoagulation and AKI, often manifested by hematuria leading to kidney injury.

To summarize, while the relationship between warfarin and AKI is recognized in the drug label, exact incidence rates and specific study data are not provided. The inclusion in the drug label suggests regulatory acknowledgment of the potential risk based on post-marketing reports and clinical observations. Healthcare professionals are routinely advised to monitor patients on warfarin for signs of renal impairment, particularly when factors predisposing to AKI are present.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label sections regarding adverse reactions and warnings, acute kidney injury is listed as an adverse reaction to warfarin, specifically associated with excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. Therefore, no summarization of evidence refuting this relationship is applicable."
acute kidney injury,water,,"To clarify, water itself is not generally considered a pharmaceutical drug; however, water can be used in medical contexts, such as for irrigation during surgical procedures. Water intoxication or overhydration is a condition in which the body takes in more water than it can excrete, leading to an imbalance of electrolytes, particularly sodium. This can lead to various complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI).

When it comes to the relationship between the potential adverse reaction of acute kidney injury and water exposure, the typical scenario would be overhydration or water intoxication leading to potentially serious health consequences. Nonetheless, acute kidney injury directly attributable to water exposure is not commonly documented within the context of a pharmaceutical drug's adverse reactions. This is because in a clinical setting, water used as an irrigant is typically controlled for appropriate volume and isotonicity to prevent such events from occurring.

The label excerpt you provided does not mention acute kidney kidney injury directly, but it alludes to issues that could arise from improper use, such as the use of excessive volume or pressure during irrigation which may cause tissue disruption. However, it does not explicitly recognize acute kidney injury as a typical or expected adverse effect of water used as an irrigation fluid under appropriate conditions.

Considering the general medical knowledge and the label information provided:

- **Clinical Trials:**
  There is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to water used in properly conducted clinical trials, as these would control for potential complications related to fluid overload.

- **Case Studies:**
  While not mentioned in your query, there may be isolated case reports or studies where improper management of water intake (in various contexts, not necessarily related to its use as an irrigant) has led to hyponatremia or water intoxication with resultant acute kidney injury. However, these are specific, atypical scenarios and not generalizable as standard reactions to water exposure.

- **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
  Since water is not a drug per se, it would not have typical post-marketing surveillance associated with pharmaceuticals. Adverse reactions would not typically be tracked in the same systematic manner as with drug exposures.

In summary, there is no known evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that directly supports the relationship between acute kidney injury and the proper medical use of water as an irrigant. Acute kidney injury may arise from water intoxication due to overhydration in different contexts, but this is an atypical and preventable scenario not typically associated with the application of water outlined in the drug label provided. If there are any specific case studies or reports that suggest such a relationship, they were not included in the information provided and would be considered outliers rather than reflective of general evidence.","NA

The query attempts to associate ""acute kidney injury"" as an adverse reaction to the exposure of water, which is a fundamental substance necessary for normal bodily functions, including kidney function. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that water itself, when consumed in appropriate quantities, causes acute kidney injury. In fact, adequate hydration is crucial for kidney health, and water is often used therapeutically to prevent and treat kidney stones and other renal conditions. Acute kidney injury is typically associated with factors like severe dehydration, certain medications, or underlying health conditions, not with water exposure itself. Therefore, there is no need to refute a relationship that is not substantiated by medical and scientific literature."
acute kidney injury,ziconotide,,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not one of the most frequently reported adverse reactions for ziconotide, as per the provided drug label sections. The commonly reported adverse reactions (≥25%) included dizziness, nausea, confusional state, and nystagmus. However, mention of acute renal failure does appear in the drug label under the subsection ""Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Studies of PRIALT,"" indicating that acute renal failure (which encompasses acute kidney injury) was an adverse event assessed as related to ziconotide and reported in fewer than 2% of patients.

Additionally, the label indicates rhabdomyolysis, a condition that can lead to AKI due to the release of muscle cell contents into the bloodstream, as one of the medically important adverse reactions occurring in fewer than 2% of patients. The relationship between ziconotide and AKI could potentially be inferred based on the occurrence of conditions that commonly lead to AKI, such as rhabdomyolysis.

The elevation of serum creatine kinase, a marker that can indicate muscle damage and potentially rhabdomyolysis, is further detailed in the warnings and precautions section, where it is noted that 40% of PRIALT-treated patients had serum creatine kinase levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

Thus, while acute kidney injury is not a widely reported or emphasized adverse reaction for ziconotide, there is some evidence suggesting that it has been reported, albeit infrequently, and that associated conditions that could predispose to AKI (rhabdomyolysis) have been observed. Evidence of this comes from the clinical study phase where adverse reactions are assessed and reported, as well as statements in the warnings and precautions which suggest monitoring for effects potentially related to AKI.

In summary, while AKI is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction of ziconotide in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance, it has been reported as an adverse event, and there have been related findings (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, increased serum creatine kinase) that could contribute to the development of AKI in patients receiving this drug.",NA
acute kidney injury,zoledronic acid,,"Evidence supports the relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) as an adverse reaction of zoledronic acid. The evidence from clinical trials, as outlined in the drug label, includes the following:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Clinical trials have demonstrated an increased risk of renal toxicity associated with zoledronic acid administration. Specifically, the administration of zoledronic acid 4 mg as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been associated with elevated serum creatinine levels, which can progress to renal failure. Moreover, Table 5 from the drug label demonstrates Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine in 2% of patients receiving zoledronic acid for hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM). Additionally, Grade 4 abnormalities (greater than 6x Upper Limit of Normal) for serum creatinine occurred in 1% of patients treated with zoledronic acid.

2. **Renal Toxicity Section**: The drug label warns of the risk of renal deterioration and suggests that renal dysfunction is dose-dependent and can be mitigated by extending the duration of the infusion to 15 minutes.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Although specific post-marketing data on AKI are not detailed within the label sections provided, the label does mention that renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and the necessity for dialysis have been seen in patients with both normal and abnormal baseline renal function.

4. **Warnings and Precautions (5.3 Renal Impairment)**: The label advises caution regarding renal impairment, highlighting the risk of adverse reactions in this group. It recommends monitoring serum creatinine before each dose and suggests avoiding use in patients with severe renal impairment. 

5. **Adverse Reactions (6.1)**: The label discusses renal toxicity, including an increase in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. It states that the incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure is reduced when zoledronic acid is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion.

In summary, evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance outlined in the drug label suggests a relationship between zoledronic acid administration and the risk of AKI. The evidence is derived from observed increases in serum creatinine following administration, reports of renal failure, and cases requiring dialysis. Renal toxicity is recognized as an adverse reaction, and the product label contains specific warnings and recommendations to mitigate this risk.",NA
acute kidney injury,zolpidem,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for zolpidem tartrate, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) as an observed adverse reaction either in the clinical trial experience (section 6.1) or in the postmarketing experience (section 6.2). The listed adverse reactions from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance do not include AKI or related renal issues as a commonly observed event.

However, under the urogenital system category, infrequent adverse reactions related to the kidney are noted, such as urinary tract infection and cystitis. The only mention related to kidney function in the label is ""rare"" occurrences of acute renal failure in the context of all reported treatment-emergent adverse events within the preapproval database, which means it was seen in fewer than 1 in 1,000 patients.

It is important to note that postmarketing experiences with uncertain event frequency and voluntary reporting may not always establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Therefore, while AKI is not identified as a common adverse reaction to zolpidem in the provided label information, the presence of acute renal failure as a rare event suggests a possible association, albeit with a very low incidence. This does not constitute strong evidence of a causal relationship but indicates that AKI or renal dysfunction may occur under certain conditions or in predisposed individuals.

As with any drug-related adverse reaction, healthcare providers should assess the benefits and risks when prescribing zolidem, especially for patients with pre-existing renal issues, and monitor for any signs of kidney injury during treatment. Patients should also be advised to report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. 

To draw a clear conclusion on the relationship between zolpidem use and AKI, further studies (such as dedicated nephrotoxicity studies, case-control studies, or more extensive post-marketing surveillance data) would be needed to determine if there's a consistent pattern of renal impairment associated with zolpidem use.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for zolpidem, acute kidney injury is not listed as an observed adverse reaction in either the clinical trials (section 6.1) or postmarketing experience (section 6.2). Furthermore, there are no mentions in the warnings or precautions sections that suggest a relationship between zolpidem use and acute kidney injury. Therefore, without additional evidence or data outside of this label information, it can be stated that there is currently no evidence suggesting acute administrative kidney injury as an adverse reaction to zolpidem."
acute liver injury,abacavir,1.0,"The provided drug label sections describe various adverse reactions associated with abacavir, an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV.

Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically is not directly detailed in the provided text. However, there are mentions of liver-related adverse events. The Warnings and Precautions section (5.2) of the label states that ""lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir."" Hepatomegaly with steatosis can be indicative of acute liver injury.

Additional liver-related issues come up under Laboratory Abnormalities sections (Tables 4 and 5 in section 6.1) which list elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), both of which are enzymes associated with liver function. Elevations in these enzymes can suggest liver injury or inflammation. While these findings do not represent conclusive evidence for acute liver injury as a common reaction, they demonstrably link abacavir exposure to potential adverse hepatobiliary effects, which could encompass acute liver injury.

Furthermore, the Postmarketing Experience (section 6.3) reports cases of lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis without explicitly mentioning acute liver injury but both these conditions can be connected to hepatic distress. Postmarketing surveillance typically assists in identifying rarer adverse events that might not be apparent in clinical trial data. In this case, the postmarketing reports further bolster the labeling warnings regarding liver-related toxicity.

It's crucial to note that the relationship between abacavir exposure and acute liver injury is inferred rather than comprehensively evidenced within this data. For an exact characterization of the risk of acute liver injury due to abacavir, it would be necessary to investigate clinical data, case reports, and registry reports not included in the drug labeling and possibly published in medical literature.

In summary, while the provided information does not explicitly establish acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction to abacavir, there is evidence linking abacavir to potential adverse liver effects, which could include acute liver injury among other conditions. Clinical surveillance and monitoring for hepatic adverse events seem warranted based on these findings.",NA
acute liver injury,abemaciclib,,"Acute liver injury is listed as an adverse reaction to abemaciclib, referenced as hepatotoxicity in the provided drug label information. The label specifies hepatotoxicity under the sections of Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) related to clinical trials of abemaciclib (brand name VERZENIO).

Clinical trial data, as summarized in the label, indicate that Grade ≥3 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 2% to 6% of patients, and Grade ≥3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increases in 2% to 3% of patients across the monarchE, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3 trials, which involved a total of 3,559 patients. The median time to onset for these events ranged from 57 to 87 days for ALT and from 71 to 185 days for AST, with the median time to resolution to Grade <3 being about 13 to 15 days.

Hepatotoxicity is also implicated in the Postmarketing Experience section, although specific frequency and causality are harder to estimate in this setting due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the uncertainty of the population size.

Grade 3 and Grade 4 hepatotoxicity events required monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) before starting treatment with VERZENIO, every two weeks for the first two months, every month for the following two months, and then as clinically indicated. The label advises dose interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation based on the severity and recurrence of liver enzyme elevations.

Furthermore, there were two deaths due to hepatotoxicity observed in the MONARCH 2 trial, underlining the seriousness of this potential adverse reaction.

In clinical trials, adverse reaction rates for hepatotoxicity reflect a clear association with abemaciclib exposure. This relationship is consistent with the pharmacological profile of the drug, which can involve hepatic metabolism and thus have the potential for liver-related adverse events.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance has established a clear relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and abemaciclib exposure. Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) and adjust abemaciclib dosing as necessary to manage this potential adverse reaction.","NA

The provided drug label sections indicate hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction of abemaciclib, with Grade ≥3 ALT (2% to 6%) and AST (2% to 3%) increases reported in patients receiving VERZENIO in clinical trials (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3). It also states that two deaths in MONARCH 2 were due to hepatotoxicity. Therefore, there is evidence that abemaciclib can cause liver injury rather than refuting it."
acute liver injury,abiraterone,,"Abiraterone is marketed under the brand name Zytiga and is indicated for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC). The evidence supporting the association of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of abiraterone comes from several sources:

**Clinical Trials:** Evidence from multiple randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (COU-AA-301, COU-AA-302, and LATITUDE) has shown an increase in liver-related adverse reactions in patients treated with abiraterone compared to placebo. In the safety analysis of pooled data from these clinical trials with 2230 patients, there was a reported incidences of grade 3-4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations (at least 5 times the upper limit of normal, ULN) in 6% of patients taking Zytiga, usually during the first three months of treatment. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function was reported in 1.1% of patients taking Zytiga. These data indicate that hepatotoxicity, which can include acute liver injury, is a potential risk associated with abiraterone use.

**Post-marketing Experience:** The post-marketing surveillance has identified severe hepatic toxicity, including cases of fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure, and some deaths associated with Zytiga use. As these are voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, the frequency of these adverse events and the establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure are more challenging to ascertain. However, they do provide additional evidence supporting an association between abiraterone and the potential for acute liver injury.

**Drug Label and Warnings:** Abiraterone's prescribing information (drug label) includes warnings and precautions regarding hepatotoxicity (section 5.3), which can be severe and fatal. It is recommended that liver function be monitored regularly, and the drug be discontinued or dosage adjusted in case of significant liver enzyme elevations.

Given the clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and warnings issued in the drug label, there is clear evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury and abiraterone exposure. Patients prescribed abiraterone need close monitoring for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, especially during the initial months of therapy.",NA
acute liver injury,abiraterone,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Abiraterone:

**Clinical Trials Data:**
- In clinical trials (COU-AA-301, COU-AA-302, LATITUDE), elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) were noted in patients treated with abiraterone acetate. The incidence of Grade 3-4 ALT or AST elevation was reported in 6% of patients receiving abiraterone acetate.
- Hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, led to treatment discontinuation in approximately 1.1% of patients taking abiraterone acetate in these trials.
- Patients were more likely to experience liver enzyme elevations if they had pre-existing liver abnormalities.
- The trials excluded patients with baseline ALT or AST levels ≥2.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or with liver metastases if these enzymes were >5x ULN, reducing the generalizability of the findings to all potential real-world patients.

**Boxed Warnings and Precautions:**
- The drug label indicates a risk of hepatotoxicity with abiraterone acetate, warning that it can be severe and fatal.
- Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended before and during treatment with abiraterone acetate.
- Abiraterone acetate treatment should be interrupted or dosage adjusted based on liver function test results.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- Postmarketing reports have identified severe hepatic toxicity, including cases of fulminant hepatitis, acute hepatic failure, and death associated with the use of abiraterone acetate.
- These reports are voluntarily provided and thus may underrepresent the true incidence or overrepresent due to reporting bias; establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure can be challenging.

**Evidence Evaluation:**
- The evidence linking abiraterone acetate with acute liver injury is supported by data from clinical trials, the drug's labeling (which includes hepatotoxicity in Warnings and Precautions), and postmarketing surveillance that includes severe cases and fatalities.
- Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is part of the recommended management for patients on abiraterone.
- While hepatotoxicity is a recognized adverse reaction, the absolute risk for individual patients is modulated by factors such as pre-existing liver function, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medications.

Given the clinical trial findings demonstrating elevated liver enzymes in a significant percentage of patients, the warnings and precautions listed in the label regarding hepatotoxicity, and the reports of severe liver injury in the postmarketing phase, there is strong evidence to support a relationship between abiraterone exposure and the potential for acute liver injury. This conclusion is drawn from the given labeling sections and known postmarketing data. However, further analysis of these data sources and vigilance in postmarketing surveillance are suggested to better characterize this risk and to inform any necessary updates to clinical practice.",NA
acute liver injury,acamprosate,,"The provided sections of the drug label for acamprosate (marketed under the name Campral among others) discuss various adverse reactions associated with its use. However, after thorough review of the provided information, there is no explicit evidence listed that directly associates acute liver injury with the exposure to acamprosate in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance as presented in these label sections.

Acamprosate is indicated for the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients. The label outlines a range of adverse reactions observed during clinical trials and post-marketing experience, which includes gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea), nervous system issues (such as anxiety, depression, and dizziness), and skin concerns (such as pruritus and sweating), among others. Serious adverse events that are highlighted include suicidality and depression, as well as acute kidney failure, but not acute liver injury. Adverse reactions impacting the liver that are mentioned include abnormal liver function tests and non-serious conditions like hepatitis and cirrhosis among infrequent events, yet these do not specify acute liver injury as a particular finding.

Post-marketing experience has identified acute kidney failure as a serious adverse event temporally associated with acamprosate use, but again, acute liver injury is not mentioned in the sections provided. 

To summarize, based on the available sections from the drug label for acamprosate, there is no documented evidence of a relationship between acamprosate exposure and acute liver injury. It is important to note that the absence of evidence in the provided sections does not necessarily mean that there is no risk, but rather that it has not been reported or identified in the context of the available information. Health care providers typically report suspected adverse reactions to regulatory agencies, which may lead to updates in drug safety information if new evidence emerges. Therefore, it would be advisable to consult the latest drug label and available literature for the most current safety information.",NA
acute liver injury,acarbose,,"The available evidence concerning the relationship between acute liver injury and the use of acarbose as an adverse reaction predominantly comes from post-marketing surveillance, as the cited drug label does not specifically list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction observed in U.S. placebo-controlled trials.

From the segment provided, it is noted that gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence are commonly reported in patients treated with acarbose. However, regarding liver injury, the label specifically mentions ""fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome"" and ""jaundice and/or hepatitis and associated liver damage"" as adverse events reported from worldwide postmarketing experience.

While this indicates reports of serious liver-related adverse events, the label does not provide detailed incidence rates, nor does it establish a causal relationship between acarbose and liver injury based solely on the provided excerpt. To establish such a relationship, it would be important to review further details on the frequency of these events, the time to onset after drug exposure, risk factors, patient characteristics, and any evidence showing improvement or resolution upon discontinuation of the drug (dechallenge) and recurrence upon re-exposure (rechallenge).

Given the lack of specific data on the incidence and causality within the provided label sections and the mention of ""postmarketing adverse event reports,"" these serious liver injury cases should be considered as potential signals that need further investigation to confirm whether they are caused by acarbose or are coincidental occurrences. Health care providers often rely on updated safety information, including medical literature, case reports, and pharmacovigilance databases, to assess the risk of adverse reactions like acute liver injury associated with drug therapies.

To summarize, there is mention of liver injury associated with acarbose use in the post-marketing surveillance reports, but the evidence provided does not detail the frequency or establish a definite causal relationship. For a more thorough assessment, additional data from clinical studies, case reports, or a more comprehensive analysis of post-marketing surveillance would be required.",NA
acute liver injury,acetazolamide,1.0,"Evidence supporting the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury related to acetazolamide use includes data referenced in the drug label from post-marketing surveillance and possibly from clinical experiences. The sections of the drug label provided above lists ""abnormal liver function, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic insufficiency, fulminant hepatic necrosis"" as part of the hepato-biliary disorders category under Adverse Reactions. This implies that there have been observed instances of liver-related adverse effects associated with the use of acetazolamide.

While the drug label contains this information, it does not provide detailed data regarding the frequency or the causality assessment used to establish these events as linked to the medication. Post-marketing surveillance often involves voluntary reporting of adverse events, which can be helpful in identifying rare or delayed reactions not detected in clinical trials. However, such reports generally require further investigation to confirm causality, as they may be influenced by various factors, including concurrent medical conditions or medications.

To provide a more data-driven evaluation, it would be necessary to consult the primary literature for case studies or clinical trials that document instances of acute liver injury in patients taking acetazolamide. In the absence of specifically referenced clinical trial data or case studies within your provided information, one cannot definitively conclude the frequency or strength of the association between acetazolamide and acute liver injury.

In summary, while acute liver injury is listed as an adverse event in the acetazolamide drug label, suggesting a relationship between the drug exposure and this serious hepatic condition, detailed evidence from clinical trials or case studies isn't provided in your query. For a definitive evaluation, further analysis of the literature and potential case reports would be necessary to understand the strength of this relationship. If investigating further, one would look for information such as the number of reported cases, the presence of other factors that could have contributed to the liver injury, and any other clinical details that could substantiate or refute a direct causal link.",NA
acute liver injury,adagrasib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and adagrasib exposure primarily comes from clinical trials, specifically the trials known as KRYSTAL-1 and KRYSTAL-12 which included patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors. Here are the relevant data points from those trials, as described in the drug label:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:**
   - Out of 366 patients treated with adagrasib (600 mg orally twice daily), the drug label reports hepatotoxicity in 37% of patients, with the pooled safety data indicating the frequency of increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 4.5% and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 4.2%. These enzymes are biomarkers for liver injury, with elevated levels indicating potential liver damage.
   - In terms of severity, 5% of liver enzyme elevation (ALT/AST) cases were Grade 3, and 0.5% were Grade 4, with the median onset time for increased ALT/AST being 3 weeks, ranging from day one to 48 weeks.

2. **Serious Adverse Reactions and Hepatotoxicity:**
   - According to the label, serious adverse reactions occurred in 57% of patients, with hepatotoxicity being a cause for permanent discontinuation of adagrasib in 13% of patients.
   - The label specifically calls out hepatotoxicity under section 5.3, describing that 0.3% of the patients experienced drug-induced liver injury, which included one case of Grade 3 severity.

It is also important to note that the drug label has a dedicated section (5.3 Hepatotoxicity) which warns about the potential for liver injury and recommends regular monitoring of liver laboratory tests before starting adagrasib treatment and periodically thereafter.

The evidence from clinical trials is thus compelling in suggesting that acute liver injury is indeed a potential adverse reaction to adagrasib. There is no mention of case studies or post-marketing surveillance in the provided sections of the drug label that would offer additional insight. Therefore, it's essential to monitor liver function in patients who are initiated on adagrasib, and manage therapy according to the observed severity of hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,adalimumab,,"Acute liver injury has been associated with adalimumab exposure, as evidenced by elevated liver enzymes and hepatic reactions. The information from clinical trials for various indications such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and Crohn's disease (CD), as documented in Sections 6.1 and 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS of the drug label, reports liver enzyme elevations.

During controlled Phase 3 trials in patients with RA, PsA, and AS, there were elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) which is a marker for liver injury. ALT elevations greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients compared to 1.5% of control-treated patients. Similar observations of ALT elevations ≥ 3 × ULN were found in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and in other controlled Phase 3 trials for adult patients with CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with adalimumab. 

Although many patients receiving adalimumab were also on concomitant medications known to elevate liver enzymes (e.g., NSAIDs, MTX), the drug label suggests that the relationship between adalimumab and liver enzyme elevations is not entirely clear.

In the postmarketing experience section of the drug label (6.3), there is mention of liver failure and hepatitis as adverse reactions observed following the approval and widespread use of adalimumab. This data comes from voluntary reports and reflects real-world usage beyond the controlled conditions of clinical trials.

The described evidence indicates a suggestive relationship between adalimumab exposure and acute liver injury. However, it's important to note that acute liver failure is a more severe outcome than liver enzyme elevation and requires careful consideration of patient-specific factors and other potential contributing causes. Clinical decisions should be based on a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history, concomitant medications, and the risk-benefit profile of adalimumab therapy.

In summary, the evidence supporting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to adalimumab comes from observed cases of liver enzyme elevations in several clinical trials, as well as reports of more severe hepatic reactions including liver failure in the post-marketing setting.","NA
"
acute liver injury,albendazole,,"Evidence for the relationship between acute liver injury and albendazole exposure is derived from several sources as per the provided drug label sections. Here's a summary of pertinent information:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
   - Adverse reactions of elevated hepatic enzymes were noted in about 16% of patients with hydatid disease treated with albendazole.
   - Treatment discontinuations due to hepatic abnormalities were observed at a rate of 3.8% in hydatid disease.
   - These suggest a connection between albendazole use and liver enzyme elevations, indicative of hepatic strain or injury.

2. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
   - Hepatobiliary disorders including elevations of hepatic enzymes, hepatitis, and acute liver failure have been reported with albendazole post-marketing.
   - The voluntary nature of these reports makes it challenging to precisely estimate frequency or firmly establish causality, but they do indicate potential occurrences of severe liver injury.

3. Hepatic Effects Warning (Section 5.5):
   - The drug label warns of mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes in clinical trials and advises monitoring before and during treatment.
   - There are cases of acute liver failure and hepatitis in the post-marketing setting, implying a more severe liver injury.
   - Recommendations are made to discontinue albendazole if significant liver enzyme elevations are detected, acknowledging the risk of hepatotoxicity.

The cohesive pattern from clinical trial observations of enzyme elevation, reported post-marketing cases of liver injury, and specific warnings regarding hepatic effects on the drug's label provides substantive evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with albendazole exposure. Each piece of evidence—from controlled clinical trial environments to the broader post-marketing settings—supports the conclusion that there is a potential risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, with the use of albendazole. However, it's important to note that in the clinical setting, these adverse reactions are typically monitored for, and the drug is discontinued if significant hepatic abnormalities are observed. The relationship between albendazole and acute liver injury, while supported by evidence, does not occur uniformly in all treated individuals and may depend on various patient-specific factors, including pre-existing liver conditions and concurrent medications.",NA
acute liver injury,aldesleukin,,"**Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury Related to Aldesleukin (Proleukin) Exposure:**

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- Hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse event (≥30%) associated with aldesleukin therapy, as evidenced by clinical trials involving 525 patients treated for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) or metastatic melanoma.
- Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were observed in 23% of patients, indicating a potential for hepatocellular injury.
- Additional life-threatening adverse reactions (Grade 4) related to hepatic function were reported in less than 1% of the 525 patients and included abnormal liver function tests.

**Other Clinical Trial Experience:**
- Hepatic failure, which can be a consequence of severe liver injury, occurred with a frequency of less than 1% in patients treated with aldesleukin-based regimens in a population of over 1800 patients with RCC, melanoma, or other cancers. These trials employed dosages different from the recommended dosage.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- Hepatitis is listed among the adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of aldesleukin, based on voluntary reports from an uncertain population size, which makes frequency estimation or establishing a causal relationship challenging.
- Other related hepatic disorders reported in postmarketing surveillance include hepatosplenomegaly.

**Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions:**
- While the boxed warnings emphasize capillary leak syndrome (CLS), neurologic toxicities, and serious infections, the additional warnings and precautions do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a prominent concern.
- Hepatotoxicity is suggested as a result of the recommendation to avoid concomitant use of aldesleukin with other products known to cause hepatotoxicity.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing experience suggests that hepatotoxic effects, such as hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes, are recognized adverse reactions associated with aldesleukin therapy. Evidence of acute liver injury is inferred from common adverse event reports of hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes, and rare instances of hepatic failure. However, precise data specifically describing acute liver injury as a unique clinical entity in the setting of aldesleukin exposure is not explicitly detailed in the provided sections. Clinicians should carefully monitor liver function in patients receiving aldesleukin and consider these potential adverse effects in their therapeutic decision-making.","NA

The provided sections of the drug label for aldesleukin, including adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, do not list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Therefore, there is no evidence in the provided sections to support refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and aldesleukin exposure since it is not described as a known adverse effect. However, hepatobiliary disorders such as hyperbilirubinemia and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase are documented, which can be indicative of liver dysfunction. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor liver function in patients receiving aldesleukin and consider all potential causes for liver injury in these patients."
acute liver injury,alectinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to alectinib is found both in clinical trial data and post-marketing experience as detailed in the provided sections of the drug label.

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Hepatotoxicity has been documented in patients treated with alectinib. Specifically, elevations of AST greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4.6% of patients, and elevations of ALT greater than 5 times the ULN occurred in 5.3% of the 405 patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673, and ALEX who received alectinib at a dose of 600 mg BID.
- Elevations of bilirubin greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 3.7% of patients, with the majority of these events occurring during the first 3 months of treatment.
- Six patients discontinued alectinib due to Grades 3-4 AST and/or ALT elevations, and four patients discontinued due to Grade 3 bilirubin elevations. Concurrent significant elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin, indicative of possibly severe liver injury, occurred in less than 1% of patients.
- Three patients with Grades 3-4 AST/ALT elevations experienced drug-induced liver injury, with two cases documented by liver biopsy.

Postmarketing Experience:
- Postmarketing reports have indicated occurrences of adverse reactions, including hepatotoxicity. However, because these reactions are voluntarily reported and from an uncertain population size, it isn't easy to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to alectinib exposure definitively.

Precautions and Monitoring Recommendations:
- The drug label recommends regular liver function tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) every 2 weeks during the first 3 months and then once a month or as clinically indicated. For patients who develop liver enzyme or bilirubin elevations, more frequent testing is advised.
- Depending on the severity of the liver adverse reactions, recommendations include withholding alectinib and resuming at a reduced dose or permanently discontinuing the drug.

Conclusion:
There is evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and alectinib use, characterized by elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels in some patients. These findings are taken from a controlled clinical environment and postmarketing reports which strengthen the evidence of this drug's adverse effects on liver function.",NA
acute liver injury,alirocumab,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for alirocumab (PRALUENT), there is evidence to suggest an association between alirocumab and liver enzyme abnormalities, which can potentially indicate liver injury. The specific evidence includes:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: In placebo-controlled trials with primary hyperlipidemia patients, liver-related disorders, primarily related to abnormalities in liver enzymes, were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with PRALUENT compared to 1.8% with placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance: Although specific to hypersensitivity, the postmarketing experience section does not mention acute liver injury outright. However, information gathered during this phase might encompass liver injury cases that could be reported in aggregate data or as individual case safety reports.

The evidence from clinical trials suggests there is a small increase in the risk of liver enzyme abnormalities with alirocumab therapy, which could be a marker for liver injury when considering the context of liver function and damage. However, acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction is not explicitly mentioned in the sections provided.

The data does not include details from individual case studies, as they are not mentioned in the label information provided. Additional information might exist in the scientific literature or in proprietary databases maintained by regulatory agencies or the manufacturer.

If further investigation were warranted, such as a review of individual case reports or other scientific studies not included in the label, one would turn to peer-reviewed journal articles, regulatory databases, or pharmacovigilance data.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials for liver enzyme abnormalities related to alirocumab, which may be indicative of liver injury. However, the drug label does not directly list acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction based on the provided sections. To fully ascertain the potential for acute liver injury related to alirocumab, additional data sources would need to be reviewed.","Based on the information provided from the adverse reactions, warnings, and postmarketing experience sections of the drug label for alirocumab (brand name PRALUENT), there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction. The sections detail various adverse reactions including hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, and liver enzyme abnormalities, with increases in serum transaminases noted in some patients.

Liver enzyme abnormalities were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with PRALUENT, compared to 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, and treatment discontinuation due to liver-related disorders was reported in 0.4% of PRALUENT-treated patients versus 0.2% with placebo. While liver enzyme elevations can be associated with liver injury, they can also occur without accompanying clinically significant acute liver injury.

In summary, while liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported, there is no provided evidence in the drug label that directly refutes or confirms acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to alirocumab. It is important to note that liver enzyme monitoring may be part of the safety assessment in clinical practice when using lipid-lowering therapies like alirocumab. If there is a concern about acute liver injury within clinical practice or published literature, it would not be reflected in the provided drug label sections. Therefore, the provided sections do not contain evidence refuting acute liver blow his missing from the list of more commonly reported adverse reactions which suggests a lack of significant findings in the clinical trial data regarding this specific adverse event. However, for a definitive conclusion, access to full clinical trial results and post-marketing surveillance data would be required."
acute liver injury,allopurinol,1.0,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Allopurinol Use:

Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label for allopurinol, as provided in the excerpt, references hepatotoxicity as a concern under Warnings and Precautions (5.4). It states that cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients taking allopurinol. Additionally, there is mention of asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase levels, which can serve as markers for liver injury. The drug label advises monitoring of liver function in patients showing symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, or pruritus, and recommends discontinuation of allopurinol in those with elevated liver enzymes.

Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions:
The label includes instructions to evaluate liver function if signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity develop (5.4). It further indicates the importance of liver enzymes monitoring, particularly in patients with an existing liver disease.

Adverse Reactions:
The ""Adverse Reactions"" section of the label (6) lists less common reactions that include hepatic necrosis, granulomatous hepatitis, hepatomegaly, and hyperbilirubinemia, among others. These are adverse reactions associated with hepatic injury and dysfunction.

Post-Marketing Reports:
There is an acknowledgment that because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily and from a diverse population of uncertain size, the frequency of reactions and establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure may not be reliable. Nonetheless, hepatic reactions have been identified and reported, which contributes to the overall body of evidence.

Summary:
The provided sections of the allopurinol drug label indicate a clear but not frequent association between allopurinol use and acute liver injury, as evidenced by mentions in both the ""Warnings and Precautions"" and ""Adverse Reactions"" sections, suggesting a recognized risk of hepatotoxicity. Although the incidence is not explicitly defined and the causal relationship is not fully quantified due to the nature of voluntary reporting, the label advises caution, monitoring of liver function, and consideration of discontinuing allopurinol in patients showing symptoms or laboratory evidence of liver injury. This evidence is derived from observations in clinical practice and post-marketing surveillance, rather than controlled clinical trials, which is common for rare but serious side effects detected after a drug has been approved and used in the general population.",NA
acute liver injury,alogliptin,,"Evidence supports that acute liver injury may be a potential adverse reaction to alogliptin, which is referenced by its trade name NESINA within the provided drug label sections.

In the clinical trial experience section of the label (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience), while adverse reactions are detailed and incidences are presented, explicit mention of acute liver injury associated with NESINA is not made. Clinical trials involving a total of 14,778 patients with type 2 diabetes did not yield a direct correlation between acute liver injury and alogliptin as defined in the summary of common adverse reactions (Table 1). However, the label does not provide a detailed breakdown of all hepatobiliary adverse reactions that might have been observed in these trials.

Postmarketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), however, identifies reports of ""fulminant hepatic failure"" and ""hepatic enzyme elevations” among the adverse reactions seen with alogliptin use. These reports, which are based on voluntary submissions from a population of uncertain size, suggest that some patients have experienced hepatic events severe enough to be reported as adverse effects, although the causality between NESINA and these reports cannot be firmly established due to the nature of postmarketing surveillance.

Furthermore, the warning and precautions section (5.4 Hepatic Effects) specifies that postmarketing reports have cited fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking alogliptin. Although these reports may lack the necessary information to conclusively determine the cause, it is indicated that liver injury should be considered if significant liver enzyme elevations are observed. Patients are advised to discontinue NESINA if clinically significant liver enzyme elevations persist or worsen and if an alternative etiology cannot be established.

In sum, based on the provided drug label, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance that suggests a potential association between alogliptin and acute liver injury, but the clinical trial data presented does not specifically address acute liver injury as a frequently observed adverse reaction. Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for symptoms of liver injury and consider discontinuation of the drug if such events occur. ",NA
acute liver injury,alogliptin,,"The evidence regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and alogliptin exposure can be derived from multiple sources, including clinical trial data, postmarketing surveillance, and the drug labeling that contains both these findings and manufacturer and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings.

Clinical Trials:
The drug label for alogliptin does not specifically mention acute liver injury under the section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, which details the results of a pooled analysis of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials involving 14,778 patients. However, it does report serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin tablets compared to 1.7% with active comparators or placebo. In the cardiovascular outcomes trial EXAMINE, ALT elevations three times the ULN occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin tablets and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo. This may indicate hepatic stress but does not necessarily confirm acute liver injury.

Postmarketing Experience:
Under section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience of the drug label, there have been postmarketing reports of hepatobiliary disorders, including ""fulminant hepatic failure."" While these reports have been identified during the postmarketing use of alogliptin tablets, they are voluntary, and the frequency or causal relationship to drug exposure cannot be reliably estimated from this data alone. Additionally, there is a section indicating that ""causality cannot be excluded"" in postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal (5.4 Hepatic Effects).

Warnings:
Section 5.4 Hepatic Effects of the drug label provides an explicit warning regarding hepatic failure associated with alogliptin use. It states that there have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking alogliptin, and although it's often challenging to establish the probable cause due to insufficient information, the potential relationship warrants caution and immediate response to symptoms suggestive of liver injury.

In summary, while direct evidence from clinical trials for acute liver injury specifically as an adverse reaction to alogliptin is not robust, there are indicators of possible hepatic effects, such as ALT elevations. The postmarketing experience suggests that there have been serious liver-related adverse events, including hepatic failure. Consequently, the drug label includes a warning advising close monitoring for liver injury and discontinuation of alogliptin if serious liver injury is detected. This evidence suggests a potential relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to alogliptin that requires attention and appropriate clinical management.",NA
acute liver injury,alprazolam,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for alprazolam, there is mention of hepatic adverse reactions, which support the relationship between acute liver injury and alprazolam exposure. The relevant evidence can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
While the provided clinical trial data does not mention acute liver injury specifically, it outlines common adverse reactions associated with alprazolam treatment for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. It also notes that clinical trials cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed in practice.

Postmarketing Experience:
The drug label specifies that acute liver injury (hepatic adverse reactions) such as hepatitis and hepatic failure, as well as liver enzyme elevations, has been identified during postapproval use of alprazolam. Adverse reactions during the postmarketing phase are voluntarily reported, and there may be difficulty in reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to alprazolam exposure due to the uncertain size of the population. The specific mention of hepatic failure and liver enzyme elevations gives credence to the relationship between alprazolam exposure and the potential risk of acute liver injury.

No specific cases or studies were provided in the drug label sections supplied to detail the frequency of liver injury related to alprazolam or to quantify the risk.

In conclusion, postmarketing surveillance data suggest that there is a potential relationship between alprazolama exposure and the adverse reaction of acute liver injury. However, the absence of detailed frequency data and the nature of voluntary reporting imply that the evidence is based on observations from postmarketing use rather than controlled clinical trials. Health professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to provide a more comprehensive picture of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute liver injury,ambrisentan,,"The provided drug label sections for ambrisentan contain several references relevant to the evaluation of potential acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to this medication:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
The clinical trials data (specifically from the ARIES-1 and ARIES-2 studies) included in the label indicate that during the 12-week controlled clinical trials, the incidence of aminotransferase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 0% on ambrisentan and 2.3% on placebo. This suggests that in the context of these trials, ambrisentan did not demonstrate a higher rate of liver enzyme elevations compared to placebo.

2. Use in Patients with Prior Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA) Related Serum Liver Enzyme Abnormalities:
In an uncontrolled, open-label study, patients who had previously discontinued other ERAs due to aminotransferase elevations were treated with ambrisentan. The summary reports that during follow-up (median of 13 months), no patients were discontinued for aminotransferase elevations, indicating that ambrisentan may have a different profile regarding liver enzyme elevations compared to other ERAs.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
The label mentions that elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) have been reported with ambrisentan use post-approval. However, it states that in most cases, alternative causes for liver injury could be identified (such as heart failure, hepatic congestion, hepatitis, alcohol use, and hepatotoxic medications). This implies that while there have been reports of liver enzyme elevations, clear causation specifically pertaining to ambrisentan is not established.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trial experience and the uncontrolled open-label study do not suggest a direct association between ambrisentan and acute liver injury. Postmarketing reports indicate rare occurrences of liver enzyme elevations, but alternative etiologies could typically be identified, mitigating against a straightforward causal relationship. It is important to note that postmarketing surveillance can sometimes uncover adverse reactions not detected in clinical trials due to larger and more diverse patient populations. However, as of the information provided, there is no conclusive evidence to support a strong relationship between ambrisentan exposure and acute liver injury. If additional data or case reports have emerged since the compilation of this information, those could provide further insights into this potential adverse reaction.","NA

The provided drug label sections do not contain evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and ambrisentan exposure, nor do they claim that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction caused by ambrisentan. On the contrary, the label indicates precautions regarding liver aminotransferase elevations, which are a marker for liver injury, and notes the need for evaluation of hepatic injury. While the incidence of aminotransferase elevations was 0% for ambrisentan during the 12-week controlled clinical trials, compared to 2.3% for placebo, the postmarketing experience section mentions reported elevations of liver aminotransferases with ambrisentan use. Hence, acute liver injury cannot be definitively stated as not being associated with ambrisentan based on the available labelling information provided."
acute liver injury,amifampridine,,"Based on the drug label information provided for amifampridine (brand name FIRDAPSE), which is used to treat Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), there is evidence to suggest that elevated liver enzymes are a common adverse reaction observed during clinical trials. This information can be considered as an indicator of potential liver injury, given that elevated liver enzymes are typically associated with liver stress or damage.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The data indicates that during the open-label run-in phase of Study 1 in adults with LEMS, out of 42 patients newly initiated on treatment with FIRDAPSE, 14% experienced elevated liver enzymes, which includes increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). These enzymes are commonly measured to assess liver function, and their elevation can be associated with acute liver injury when substantially increased.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
The drug label also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions to either Catalyst Pharmaceuticals or the FDA. While specific post-marketing surveillance data for acute liver injury is not provided in the label summary, the inclusion of a reporting mechanism suggests that clinicians and patients should remain vigilant for adverse reactions, including those affecting the liver, and report them when they occur. This can help in establishing a more definitive post-marketing safety profile over time.

It should be noted that while elevated liver enzymes are mentioned, the term ""acute liver injury"" is not explicitly used in the drug label sections provided. However, elevated liver enzymes are a recognized proxy for potential liver injury and should be investigated further in the clinical context.

To summarize, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and amifampridine comes from clinical trial data that includes a reported 14% incidence of elevated liver enzymes in patients initiating treatment. A direct causal relationship between amifampridine and acute liver injury is not explicitly detailed in the provided sections, but the presence of elevated liver enzymes warrants careful monitoring of liver function during treatment with the drug.

Future surveillance and research might provide more definitive evidence of a causal relationship. Health care providers should continue to monitor for signs of liver injury in patients taking amifampridine and report any suspected cases of adverse reactions according to existing regulations and guidelines.",NA
acute liver injury,amiodarone,,"Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to amiodarone is supported by various pieces of evidence as indicated in the drug label sections provided:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Adverse reactions leading to the discontinuation of amiodarone include an elevation of liver enzymes, as observed in some treated patients. While no specific percentages are provided for hepatic injury, the mention of liver enzyme elevation indicates an awareness of hepatotoxic potential.
   
2. **Postmarketing Experience**: Post-approval surveillance of amiodarone has identified hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis as adverse reactions. These are significant indicators of severe liver injury that have been voluntarily reported, though specific frequency rates aren’t available. The causal relationship to drug exposure is suggested but not definitively established due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

3. **Warnings and Precautions Section 5.3 (Hepatic Injury)**: The warning section explicitly states that amiodarone can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Additionally, it notes that asymptomatic elevations in liver enzyme levels are common and that histological findings may resemble those of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Baseline and periodic liver transaminases are recommended, and amiodarone should be discontinued or reduced in dosage if significant liver enzyme elevations are observed.

4. **Boxed Warning**: Reflecting the seriousness of potential hepatic toxicity, a warning in the product labeling specifically mentions that amiodarone has substantial toxicity, including hepatic toxicity.

The evidence presented from clinical trial experiences, post-marketing reports, and specific warnings in the product labeling consistently support the relationship between amiodarone exposure and the potential for acute liver injury. These findings are derived from the synthesis of observed clinical outcomes, which suggest a correlation between the drug's use and adverse hepatic effects, ranging from enzyme elevations to severe liver damage. It is also important to consider that the actual incidence of acute liver injury could be underreported given the voluntary nature of postmarketing surveillance reporting systems.",NA
acute liver injury,amitriptyline,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to amitriptyline is mentioned under the ""Gastrointestinal"" subcategory of the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section. The label states that hepatitis (including altered liver function and jaundice) has been reported rarely. This indicates that there have been some instances where patients experienced liver-related issues following the administration of amitriptyline. However, it is important to note that these cases are infrequent.

The label also specifies that the causal relationship is uncertain for some reactions, including hepatic failure, listed under ""Digestive"" in the section titled ""Causal Relationship Unknown."" This implies that although hepatic failure has been observed in some patients taking amitriptyline, a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the drug exposure and acute liver injury has not been definitively established.

In summary, the evidence from the drug label indicates that acute liver injury, including hepatitis and altered liver function, is a potential adverse reaction of amitriptyline, although such occurrences are rare. The causal relationship between amitriptyline and hepatic failure is not definitively established. Absent from the drug label are specific references to evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data that provide further detail on the incidence or mechanism of amitriptyline-induced acute liver injury. For a comprehensive risk assessment, clinicians consider this information in conjunction with knowledge of the patient's clinical situation and the broader medical literature.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for amitriptyline, there is an indication that hepatic reactions such as hepatitis, including altered liver function and jaundice, can occur as adverse reactions to the drug. Given this information, there is no evidence from the provided sections of the drug label that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and amitriptyline use. Refuting such a relationship would require evidence to the contrary, which is not present in the label sections given."
acute liver injury,amobarbital,,"The drug label for amobarbital, provided by Bausch Health US, LLC, lists various adverse reactions obtained from surveillance of hospitalized patients who have received barbiturates. Among these adverse reactions, liver damage is mentioned under the ""Other Reported Reactions"" section, though without specifying the frequency or providing detailed information regarding the association between amobarbital use and acute liver injury.

Given the information from the provided label sections, acute liver injury is cited as an adverse reaction, however, the drug label does not offer detailed evidence such as findings from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance to substantiate the frequency or the strength of the association between amobarbital exposure and acute liver injury. Additionally, in the sections provided, there is no differentiation in reactions specifically due to amobarbital versus other barbiturates.

It is important to recognize that drug labels are obliged to report adverse reactions that have been observed, but these reports do not by themselves establish causality. Further investigation into medical literature, such as peer-reviewed articles, pharmacovigilance databases, or clinical trial data, would be necessary to obtain detailed evidence about the incidence, plausible causation, and clinical presentation of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically to amobarbial.

Key points from the provided drug label include:
- Acute liver damage is recognized as a potential adverse reaction.
- The frequency and causality are not specified.
- The details needed to evaluate the strength of the relationship are not included in the provided sections.

In conclusion, while the drug label suggests the existence of a potential adverse reaction of liver damage with barbiturate use, it does not offer conclusive evidence for acute liver injury specifically associated with amobarbital. To properly ascertain this relationship, additional sources of evidence should be evaluated.",NA
acute liver injury,anagrelide,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections concerning adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically to anagrelide is suggested within the scope of hepatobiliary disorders reported during postmarketing experience. While the clinical trials section (6.1) included in the drug label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury among the listed adverse reactions, the postmarketing experience (6.2) cites ""Clinically significant hepatotoxicity (including symptomatic ALT and AST elevations and elevations greater than three times the ULN)"" as having been identified following the use of AGRYLIN (the trade name of anagrelide). 

ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase) are liver enzymes that are typically evaluated to assess liver health. Elevations in these enzymes can indicate liver cell damage and are therefore commonly used as markers for hepatotoxicity. An elevation greater than three times the upper limit of normal is clinically significant and often prompts further investigation for potential acute liver injury.

The evidence for acute liver injury associated with anagrelide primarily comes from post-market surveillance rather than from the initial clinical trials. This is not an uncommon situation as certain adverse reactions may not emerge until after a drug is widely used in the general population outside the more controlled setting of a clinical trial.

It is important to note that postmarketing data often lacks the controlled conditions of clinical trials and is based on voluntary reports, which means that the frequency of events and the establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure are less certain. 

The label also notes that hepatic impairment can increase anagrelide exposure which may, in turn, increase the risk of prolonged QT interval, a known cardiovascular risk associated with the drug. While this isn't directly related to acute liver injury, it does indicate that there is a recognized interaction between anagrelide and liver function.

In summary, the evidence linking acute liver injury to anagrelide is derived from postmarketing reports of significant hepatotoxicity. This evidence should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations intrinsic to postmarketing surveillance data. Nevertheless, these reports have been significant enough to be included in the official drug label, indicating recognition by regulatory agencies of a potential risk of liver injury associated with anagrelide use. Health care providers are encouraged to monitor liver enzymes and assess liver function when prescribing anagrelide.",NA
acute liver injury,anidulafungin,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Anidulafungin:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- The label for anidulafungin (trade name ERAXIS) indicates that laboratory abnormalities in liver tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and pediatric patients (Section 6.1 Hepatic Adverse Reactions).
- Clinically significant hepatic abnormalities have occurred in patients with serious underlying medical conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications along with ERAXIS, which may suggest a relationship but does not establish causation. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure have been reported; however, it is unclear if these are directly due to anidulafungin as a causal relationship has not been established (Section 5.1 Hepatic Adverse Reactions).
- In clinical trial experiences with adults detailed in the label (Section 6.1), increased hepatic enzyme levels (which could indicate liver injury) were reported by 5% of patients, which suggests a potential link to hepatic adverse reactions.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- The drug label mentions that during the post-marketing experience, there have been adverse reactions voluntarily reported which are associated with drug exposure, but due to the nature of voluntary reporting, it is difficult to estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Section 6.2 Post-marketing Experience). The label does not detail specific reports of acute liver injury in the post-marketing surveillance data, indicating a lack of clear evidence from this source.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The label notes the need to monitor hepatic function during therapy with ERAXIS, due to the risk of abnormal liver tests, hepatitis, and hepatic failure (Section 5.1 Hepatic Effects). This implies a recognized concern for potential liver-related adverse effects associated with anidulafungin.

Overall, while there is a noted risk for hepatic adverse reactions, which include laboratory abnormalities in liver tests and instances of clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure, the current labeling does not explicitly establish a direct causative link between anidulafungin and acute liver injury. The given data suggest the possibility of an association, but more concrete evidence, such as case studies or a higher incidence rate in clinical trials, would be needed to definitively establish a causal relationship. Monitoring of hepatic function is recommended when administering anidulafungin.","Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and anidulafungin (ERAXIS). The adverse reactions section and warnings and precautions mention the potential for hepatic adverse reactions, and cases of significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure have been reported in patients. However, a causal relationship to anidulafungin has not been established. Monitoring of hepatic function during therapy with anidulafungin is recommended. Therefore, given the lack of evidence specifically refuting the potential for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to anidulafungin, it is not possible to provide evidence showing that acute liver injury is not related to the drug. The relationship remains plausible, and the prescribing information recommends monitoring for liver issues, indicating that there is concern regarding liver-related adverse effects with anidulafungin use.

acute liver injury,apixaban,,"The provided sections from the drug label for apixaban (marketed as ELIQUIS) focus on the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and post-marketing experience, along with warnings and precautions regarding the use of the drug. However, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction within these sections. 

According to the clinical trial experience conveyed in the label, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>1%) were related to bleeding, with various types of hemorrhage being the most frequently observed adverse events. These events were systematically reported and analyzed in large clinical trials such as ARISTOTLE and AVERROES for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and in ADVANCE studies for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery.

The warnings and precautions sections alert prescribers to potential thrombotic and bleeding risks, including increased risk of bleeding, increased risk of thrombotic events after premature discontinuation, spinal/epidural hematoma risk with neuraxial anesthesia procedures, the drug's unsuitability for patients with prosthetic heart valves, and specific recommendations regarding patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome.

Liver-related adverse reactions are only briefly mentioned with regards to increased transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), which do not directly indicate acute liver injury but may suggest some hepatic impact in a small percentage of patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery.

To conclude, within the label sections provided, there is no direct evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and use of apixaban. Adverse hepatic effects mentioned are limited to increases in liver transaminases, which typically reflect mild to moderate hepatic stress rather than acute liver injury. If acute liver injury is a concern in relation to apixaban use, it has not been highlighted as a significant adverse reaction in the provided label information or identified as a clinically significant issue in the large clinical trials referenced. Further clinical data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports outside the scope of this label would be necessary to evaluate any possible causal relationship between apixaban and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,apixaban,,"The information provided in the drug label for apixaban (ELIQUIS) does not include acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the medication. The primary adverse reactions and safety concerns cited pertain to bleeding risks, as is common with anticoagulant therapies. According to the clinical trial experience detailed in the prescribing information, the most commonly reported adverse events for apixaban are related to bleeding, including major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding.

The drug label mentions bleeding events in various clinical settings, such as patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE and AVERROES trials), patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery (ADVANCE trials), and patients with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies). Adverse reactions other than bleeding are reported to occur at lower frequencies and include hypersensitivity reactions, liver function test abnormalities, and increased levels of liver enzymes (transaminases and gamma-glutamyltransferase).

Liver function test abnormalities are mentioned under the less common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥0.1% to <1% for patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery and do not speak specifically to acute liver injury.

Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no specific evidence supporting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction attributed to apixaban exposure according to the summarized clinical trials and reported post-marketing adverse reactions. The possible occurrence of liver function test abnormalities does suggest that liver-related effects may occur, but there is no indication that acute liver injury is a typical or well-documented complication associated with this medication.

Should new evidence emerge or post-marketing surveillance reports suggest a link between apixaban and acute liver injury, additional investigations and updates to the product labeling would be necessary. It is important to monitor patient outcomes and report suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate channels such as Bristol-Myers Squibb or the FDA's MedWatch program for continued pharmacovigilance.","NA

acute liver injury,aripiprazole,,"The drug label information you provided for aripiprazole does not list acute liver injury as a commonly observed adverse reaction or include it under the other sections such as warnings, and box warnings. Acute liver injury is not listed among the adverse reactions discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling, nor is it mentioned in the sections on warnings and precautions, including those related to metabolic changes.

The most common adverse reactions noted in the clinical trial experience section of the label for adults and pediatric patients across various indications do not include hepatic issues. Instead, reactions such as akathisia, insomnia, and extrapyramidal disorder are more frequently mentioned.

Furthermore, in the post-marketing experience section, while some hepatic disorders are noted as rare occurrences (such as hepatitis and jaundice), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury. It is important to note that post-marketing reports include adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of aripiprazole which are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and therefore, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Since acute liver injury is not listed or detailed in the provided label information for aripiprazole, it suggests that either this adverse event has not been observed in relationship to the drug during the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance to a significant extent, or it was not reported at a frequency greater than that of the general population.

However, it cannot be ruled out that individual cases or a low incidence of acute liver injury might have been observed or reported post-marketing. Clinicians should always monitor for any unlisted adverse events and report them accordingly. If such data has become available after the knowledge cutoff or outside of the provided labeling, a literature search or access to pharmacovigilance databases would be required for updated information.",NA
acute liver injury,aripiprazole lauroxil,,"Based on the information provided, acute liver injury is not listed as a commonly observed adverse reaction or highlighted in the warnings or box warnings sections for aripiprazole lauroxil (marketed as ARISTADA). The sections provided detail various adverse reactions and warnings associated with the use of aripiprazole lauroxil, including increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, metabolic changes, and others, but there is no specific mention of acute liver injury.

The adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and postmarketing experience include different nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac, and general disorders among others. Similarly, postmarketing experience mentioned other adverse reactions such as pathological gambling, hiccups, blood glucose fluctuation, oculogyric crisis, and DRESS, which is a severe drug-induced reaction that typically includes a skin rash, fever, and internal organ involvement, but again, acute liver injury was not listed.

The hepatic-related adverse reactions that were reported with oral aripiprazole in the clinical trials included hepatitis, increased hepatic enzyme, jaundice, and increased blood bilirubin; these unfortunately do not directly provide insight into the potential for acute liver injury with aripiprazole lauroxil specifically.

In summary, there is currently no evidence explicitly relating acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to aripiprazole lauroxil, as it is not documented in the clinical studies experience, postmarketing experience, or in the warnings and precautions sections provided for ARISTADA. It's important to note that this summary is based on the specific information supplied, and the complete safety profile of any drug may include additional details not contained within the provided text. Healthcare professionals typically consider various data sources when evaluating drug safety, and the absence of reported adverse reactions in one document does not preclude their existence. If acute liver injury is suspected in the context of aripiprazole lauroxil treatment, healthcare providers would typically investigate and report this to appropriate drug safety monitoring systems.","NA

Based on the provided drug label information for aripiprazole lauroxil (ARISTADA), acute liver injury is not listed as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials data, postmarketing experience, or under warnings and precautions associated with the drug. Therefore, evidence refuting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of aripiprazole lauroxil would not be necessary, given that it is not recognized as an established adverse effect of this medication within the provided label."
acute liver injury,arsenic trioxide,,"As per the provided drug label, there is evidence that hepatotoxicity, which may include acute liver injury, is an adverse reaction associated with arsenic trioxide exposure. The hepatotoxicity warning notes that long-term liver abnormalities have been observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with arsenic trioxide. The recommendation is to monitor hepatic function tests at least twice weekly during induction and at least once weekly during consolidation. If elevations in AST (aspartate aminotransferase) or alkaline phosphatase are greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal and/or elevation in serum total bilirubin occurs to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, it is advised to withhold arsenic trioxide and resume at a reduced dose upon resolution of these indices of hepatic injury (Section 5.4 Hepatotoxicity).

It's important to note that while hepatotoxicity can manifest as various types of liver injury, including acute liver injury, the label does not provide specific data on the incidence of acute liver injury itself. However, the label does state that there were observations of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) increased in 20% of patients (8 patients, with 2 instances graded as ≥3), which is a marker commonly associated with liver injury (Table 5 of Clinical Trials Experience, Section 6.1).

In conclusion, while the label does not specify acute liver injury per se, it does acknowledge hepatotoxicity as a significant adverse reaction of arsenic trioxide use based on the observed liver enzyme abnormalities during clinical trials. Monitoring liver function and managing symptoms according to protocol are recommended to manage this risk.

Please note that no specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data were provided in the drug label information. Additional sources, such as peer-reviewed studies and post-marketing reports, would be necessary to further evaluate the evidence for a relationship between arsenic trioxide and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,asenapine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for SAPHRIS® (asenapine), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction or as a finding in clinical trials. The sections provided detail extensively on various adverse reactions observed during the premarketing and clinical trial phases, as well as postmarketing experiences. However, acute liver injury is not listed among them.

Specifically referenced are adverse reactions such as akathisia, oral hypoesthesia, somnolence, metabolic changes, hypersensitivity reactions, and various others. The label also addresses postmarketing experiences that include application site reactions and instances of choking, but again, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned.

That being said, the label does note under the Laboratory Test Abnormalities section that transient elevations in serum transaminases, which are indicative of liver function, were more common in SAPHRIS-treated patients compared to placebo in short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania adult trials. While these are not necessarily indicative of acute liver injury, they do show that the drug can have some effect on liver enzymes, which could be a potential signal warranting further investigation.

Since clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance are constantly updated after a drug's release, it is possible that cases of acute liver injury related to asenapine may have been reported or published in medical literature or databases after the provision of this label information. For the most current information, a search of updated sources such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), scientific publications, or product safety updates would be necessary. However, based on the information supplied here, there is no direct evidence in the label to suggest that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction of asenapine.","NA
"
acute liver injury,asenapine,,"The inquiry pertains to evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the drug asenapine, marketed as SECUADO. The provided sections of the drug label mention potential hepatic enzyme increases under ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience,"" specifically within the subsection ""Laboratory Test Abnormalities: Transaminases."" It mentions that transient elevations in serum transaminases (primarily alanine aminotransferase, ALT) were more common in SECUADO-treated patients than in placebo patients. There was a mean increase of 6.0 units/L and 3.8 units/L for patients treated with SECUADO doses of 3.8 mg/24 hours and 7.6 mg/24 hours, respectively, vs. a decrease of 1.1 units/L in the placebo group.

Furthermore, a small proportion of patients treated with SECUADO (1.6% for 3.8 mg/24 hours and 3.1% for 7.6 mg/24 hours doses) experienced ALT elevations ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at some point, in comparison to 0% in the placebo group.

While these increases in transaminase levels may suggest potential hepatotoxicity, the label does not directly correlate these lab findings with clinical acute liver injury. The evidence provided does not include reports of acute liver injury or more severe hepatic adverse events. However, elevations in liver enzymes can be an indicator of liver stress or damage, suggesting a need for monitoring and caution.

Postmarketing surveillance is referenced in section ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience,"" but acute liver injury is not expressly mentioned. Instead, it states that adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of sublingual asenapine (a format of the same medication) are possible with SECUADO treatment, implying that any hepatic issues observed with sublingual asenapine could theoretically occur with SECUADO as well.

In conclusion, clinical trial data included in the drug label indicates that asenapine (SECUADO) can cause increases in liver enzymes, which may be a precursor to hepatic injury. However, no direct clinical evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to asenapine exposure, such as case studies of acute hepatic failure or dysfunction, is provided in the label. Monitoring liver enzymes during treatment can be prudent to detect potential hepatotoxicity early. Additional post-marketing surveillance and external studies would be needed to further establish and characterize the link between asenapine and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,asparaginase,,"The relationship between asparaginase exposure and acute liver injury is well-documented, supported by evidence from clinical trials and safety data, including hepatotoxicity warnings on drug labels. Here is a summary of the evidence:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
According to the label for Rylaze (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn), the safety profile was assessed in a multiple-cohort study, JZP458-201. Safety analysis included patients who received various intramuscular dosages of Rylaze combined with chemotherapy. Abnormal liver tests were one of the most common nonhematological adverse reactions, occurring in more than 20% of patients (Grade 3-4 severity was observed in up to 27%). Elevated bilirubin and/or transaminases were seen in 75% of the treated patients, with 26% having Grade 3 or higher elevations. These data indicate a significant incidence of liver enzyme alterations among patients treated with asparaginase, suggesting potential hepatotoxicity.

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
While specific case studies and post-marketing surveillance details are not provided in your summary, the drug label mentions hepatotoxicity as a clinically significant adverse reaction, with recommendations for monitoring liver function. Clinicians are instructed to evaluate bilirubin and transaminases before and during treatment with Rylaze, reflecting concern for possible liver damage based on post-marketing surveillance. This heightened awareness in the warnings and precautions section aligns with the reported hepatotoxic effects found during clinical trials.

Warnings on Drug Labels:
The warnings and precautions section of the drug label explicitly acknowledges hepatotoxicity (section 5.5) as a risk associated with Rylaze. It advises monitoring for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, baseline, and routine assessments of liver function, and provides instructions for discontinuing therapy in the event of serious liver toxicity. The presence of hepatotoxicity as a highlighted warning underlines the recognized relationship between asparaginase exposure and acute liver injury.

In conclusion, clinical trial data from study JZP458-201, along with the hepatotoxicity warnings and guidelines for liver function monitoring on the Rylaze label, provide robust evidence for the relationship between asparaginase exposure and acute liver injury. These sources illustrate significant adverse reactions affecting liver function in patients receiving this medication, confirming that acute liver injury is associated with asparaginase use.",NA
acute liver injury,atenolol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute liver injury is not listed as a commonly reported adverse reaction to atenolol. The most frequently noted adverse effects of atenolol are cardiovascular-related, such as bradycardia (slowed heart rate), along with some central nervous system effects like dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea. The drug label does mention, in the context of postmarketing experience, that there have been instances reported where atenolol use was temporally associated with elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin. However, this information does not directly establish a causative link between atenolol and acute liver injury, nor does it provide incidence rates or detailed clinical outcomes associated with these reports.

It's important to note that postmarketing surveillance data can sometimes identify potential adverse reactions that may not have been apparent during pre-market clinical trials. These reports can be influenced by various factors, including underreporting, lack of certainty that the drug caused the event, and the variable quality of the information. Nevertheless, they can serve as a signal to healthcare professionals and researchers to investigate further.

While there is a mention of elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin, which could indicate a stress on liver function, the label does not provide enough detailed evidence to conclusively link atenolol with acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. Additionally, the source of the data is postmarketing surveillance, which is less controlled than data from clinical trials. 

Thus, with the information available in the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, there is a mention of liver enzyme changes in the context of postmarketing experience but no concrete evidence that acute liver injury is a directly attributable adverse reaction to atenolol. Further investigation or studies could provide more insight into this potential relationship. Health professionals should report suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities to facilitate the accumulation of more evidence on this potential issue.","NA

The label information provided does not list acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction to atenolol. Acute liver injury is not amongst the volunteered or elicited adverse effects from controlled studies, nor is it reported in the postmarketing experience with atenolol as listed in the label. Moreover, the provided sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings do not refute the relationship between atenolol and acute liver injury; they simply do not establish such a relationship. Therefore, there's no evidence presented in these sections to refute the relationship because acute liver injury is not mentioned as a potential adverse reaction of atenolol to begin with."
acute liver injury,atezolizumab,,"Based on the provided drug label information for atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ), acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) is documented as a potential adverse reaction. The evidence for hepatotoxicity associated with atezolizumab predominantly comes from clinical trials. Here are specific findings substantiating the relationship between atezolizumab and acute liver injury:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: 
   - Immune-mediated hepatitis, which can be a manifestation of acute liver injury, occurred in 1.8% (48/2616) of patients receiving atezolizumab as a single agent. Grades of severity ranged from fatal (less than 0.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.5%), to Grade 2 (0.5%).
   - In cases where atezolizumab was used in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 6.1% (14/230 patients), indicating a notable incidence of liver-related adverse reactions with this combination.

2. **Safety Profiles and Adverse Event Reporting**: 
   - The label advises monitoring liver enzymes, suggesting liver injury is a recognized concern. Lab abnormalities related to liver function tests, such as increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were reported in the safety studies.
   - Serious adverse reactions, including cases of hepatic failure, have led to discontinuation or interruption of atezolizumab therapy in some patients.
   - Postmarketing surveillance also identified incidents of hepatotoxicity; however, the frequency is not defined since postmarketing data depend on voluntary reporting.

The label provides recommendations for monitoring and managing Hepatotoxicity, such as the need for systemic corticosteroids in some patients, reflecting the importance of hepatitis as a concern during treatment. Given the reported incidence rates of liver injury-related events and the seriousness of some of these adverse reactions leading to treatment modification or discontinuation, there is clear evidence supporting an association between atezolizumab and acute liver injury.

No specific mention of postmarketing data regarding atezolizumab and acute liver injury was provided in the label sections referenced, aside from general instructions on reporting suspected adverse reactions to the FDA. While clinical trial data derived from safety assessments present a strong case for the relationship, real-world evidence from postmarketing surveillance would offer additional insights into less common or longer-term effects, which are not detailed in the provided sections.",NA
acute liver injury,atorvastatin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and atorvastatin exposure is outlined in various sections of the drug label as follows:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: The atorvastatin calcium placebo-controlled clinical trial database includes instances where atorvastatin was associated with increases in liver enzymes. Persistent elevations in serum transaminases (defined as more than three times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) were observed in 0.7% of patients. These abnormalities in liver function were dose-dependent, with higher incidences at increased atorvastatin doses.

2. **Treating to New Targets Study (TNT)**: In this study involving patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease (CHD), persistent transaminase elevations occurred in 1.3% of individuals on a high dose (80 mg) of atorvastatin and in 0.2% of individuals on a lower dose (10 mg).

3. **The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL)**: This study noted a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations in the group treated with atorvastatin 80 mg (0.9%) compared to the placebo group (0.1%). 

4. **Postmarketing Experience**: Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin, which is a more severe outcome than liver enzyme elevations. While these postmarketing reports do not always establish cause and effect, they indicate the potential for serious liver injury in some patients taking atorvastatin.

5. **Warnings and Precautions (Hepatic Dysfunction)**: The label advises that increases in serum transaminases have occurred with atorvastatin, and while these are often transient and resolve with continued therapy or after a brief interruption, they can be persistent. There are rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure. Liver enzyme testing is recommended before starting therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter, particularly if clinical symptoms of liver injury develop.

The evidence from the cited clinical trials demonstrates a clear dose-dependent relationship between atorvastatin use and the risk of liver enzyme elevations, which can be an indicator of liver injury. The postmarketing experiences, which include more severe hepatic outcomes, reinforce the potential for atorvastatin to cause liver injury in some patients. However, the available data do not describe the exact frequency of acute liver injury distinct from enzyme elevations or provide detailed clinical characteristics of the severe liver injury cases. It is important to consider that while the risk exists, such adverse reactions are relatively rare compared to the number of patients treated with atorvastatin.",NA
acute liver injury,atovaquone,,"The clinical evidence supporting the association of acute liver injury with atovaquone use is present in both clinical trial data and post-marketing reports, as referenced in the provided drug label sections.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**

1. During clinical trials, atovaquone was evaluated in patients for the prevention and treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Various adverse reactions were reported, with gastrointestinal events being prominent. However, liver enzyme alterations were also noted.
   
2. **PCP Treatment Trials:** In the TMP-SMX comparative trial, 2% of subjects treated with atovaquone had therapy prematurely discontinued due to elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), which are biomarkers for liver injury.
   
3. **Challenges in Attribution:** The label notes the difficulty in distinguishing adverse reactions caused by atovaquone from those due to underlying medical conditions in subjects with complications of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease.

**Postmarketing Experience:**

1. Hepatotoxicity, including cases of cholestatic hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, and fatal liver failure, have been reported in patients treated with atovaquone as identified during post-approval use. These reports suggest a link between atovaquone and liver injury.

2. The postmarketing data rely on voluntary reporting, which may underrepresent the incidence but still provides support for the potential adverse reaction of liver injury.

**Box Warnings and Precautions:**

1. The label warns of hepatotoxicity, specifically mentioning elevated liver enzymes and cases of hepatitis and fatal liver failure.

In conclusion, the evidence from the clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance indicates that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction of atovaquone. While further controlled studies could provide more definitive evidence, the information available from these sources suggests a causal relationship. It is important to monitor liver function tests in patients receiving atovaquone, especially those with underlying liver conditions or concurrent medications with similar hepatic risk profiles.",NA
acute liver injury,auranofin,,"Based on the provided drug label information, the relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to auranofin (Ridaura®) is supported by evidence primarily from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. The label indicates that elevated liver enzymes, which can be indicative of liver damage or injury, were observed as an adverse reaction in patients treated with auranofin. However, jaundice, a more specific sign of significant liver injury, has been reported less frequently, and acute liver injury itself is not prominently listed on the label.

Here is a summary of the specific evidence as delineated on the label:

1. Clinical Trials: Among 4,784 patients treated with auranofin, elevated liver enzymes were reported as an adverse reaction. While the label does not directly mention ""acute liver injury"" as a common reaction, elevated liver enzymes can be associated with liver injury. Additionally, the incidence of adverse reactions is highest during the first six months of treatment, and the label notes it can occur after many months of therapy.

2. Post-Marketing Experience: Although less data is presented for post-marketing surveillance compared to clinical trials, jaundice is listed as an adverse reaction that occurs in less than 1% of the RIDAURA-treated patients. Jaundice is symptomatic of liver injury but might not directly imply acute liver injury.

3. Comparative Evidence: When comparing patients treated with auranofin to those treated with injectable gold preparations, there was a reported 1.9% incidence of elevated liver function tests in auranofin-treated patients versus 1.7% in patients receiving injectable gold.

The drug label also references gold toxicity, which includes a range of possible adverse reactions, some of which may involve the liver. Furthermore, it stresses the need for regular laboratory work to monitor for signs of toxicity, including liver function, before prescribing auranofin. 

From the data presented in this drug label, it is reasonable to conclude that there is evidence of liver-related adverse reactions, but the information provided does not offer a detailed incidence rate or characterization specifically of ""acute liver injury"" with the use of auranofin. Healthcare professionals are advised to explain the risk of adverse reactions to patients and monitor them for any symptoms indicative of toxicity, including liver-related issues.",NA
acute liver injury,avelumab,,"The provided sections of the drug label for avelumab (BAVENCIO) offer insights into potential adverse reactions related to its use but do not explicitly state acute liver injury as a singled-out adverse reaction. Nevertheless, hepatotoxicity, which encompasses acute liver injury, is mentioned. Here's a summary of the relevant reported evidence:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- In the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial—meant for evaluating avelumab in patients with metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC)—increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were among the adverse reactions noted.
- In JAVELIN Renal 101 which assessed avelumab in combination with axitinib for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), 24% of patients had increased levels of AST and 22% had increased levels of ALT, which can be indicators of liver injury.

**Immune-Mediated Hepatitis:**
- In general avelumab use, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.1% of patients.
- When avelumab was used in combination with axitinib, increased incidences of Grade 3 and 4 elevations in ALT and AST were observed compared to the use of avelumab alone. Hepatotoxicity (which could include acute liver injury) as an adverse reaction was reported at 24% with Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity at 9%.
- The combination treatment led to a higher frequency of hepatotoxicity, requiring more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes and potentially systemic corticosteroid administration.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- The labeling emphasized that immune-mediated adverse reactions, including immune-mediated hepatitis, can be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, and can arise at any time during treatment.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
- There is no explicit mention of post-marketing surveillance data specifically for acute liver injury related to avelumab in the provided sections.

In synopsis, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to avelumab does have some backing in the context of broader categories like increased liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity documented in clinical trials and specified under warnings for immune-mediated hepatitis. However, there is no specific evidence in the provided sections to conclusively state that acute liver injury alone is a well-characterized adverse reaction to avelumab. Clinicians should monitor liver enzyme levels and manage any presenting hepatotoxicity, potentially with the aid of corticosteroids, and consider the benefits and risks of continuing treatment with avelumab if hepatotoxicity arises.",NA
acute liver injury,axitinib,,"Acute liver injury is recognized as a potential adverse reaction related to axitinib use. This is evidenced by the occurrences of hepatotoxicity mentioned in various sections of the drug label. Below is a summary of the available evidence:

**Clinical Trials:**

1. **INLYTA as a single agent**: In clinical trials of axitinib (INLYTA) used as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), liver enzyme elevations were common, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations occurring in 22% of patients in both the axitinib and the comparison drug (sorbitol) arms, with Grade 3/4 events being very rare (less than 1%).

2. **INLYTA in combination with avelumab**: In the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial for first-line treatment of advanced RCC, hepatotoxicity was reported in 24% of patients taking axitinib in combination with avelumab, with 18% experiencing Grade 3/4 elevations. Notably, recovery from ALT elevations to Grades 0-1 occurred in 92% of cases when patients had ALT ≥3 times ULN.

3. **INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab**: The KEYNOTE-426 study reported that 39% of patients experienced some degree of hepatotoxicity when axitinib was used in conjunction with pembrolizumab, including 20% with Grade 3/4 elevations of ALT. In cases with ALT ≥3 times ULN, 94% resolved to Grades 0-1. 

**Postmarketing Surveillance:**

Postmarketing reports are mentioned for other adverse reactions, but there is no specific aggregated data provided for acute liver injury in the information given. Postmarketing experience supplement and confirm clinical trial data but often provide limited quantifiable evidence.

**Recommendations from the Label:**

- Monitoring liver enzymes before initiation and periodically during treatment is recommended, especially when axitinib is administered in combination with immunotherapy agents (avelumab or pembrolizumab), because there is an increased frequency of higher-grade liver enzyme elevations.
- The label also provides guidance for dose modification and/or interruption of therapy in cases when hepatic adverse reactions are observed.

Based on this evidence, there is clear support for the relationship between axitinib exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, as reflected in the occurrences of hepatotoxicity during axitinib treatment, both as a monotherapy and in combinations with other therapeutic agents such as avelumab and pembrolizumab. Clinical trials have demonstrated this relationship and the need for hepatic function monitoring is reflected in the recommendations for the drug's administration.",NA
acute liver injury,axitinib,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:
- Axitinib (INLYTA), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been evaluated in various clinical trials for safety and efficacy. Within these trials, hepatotoxicity has been identified as a potential adverse reaction (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience). The reference to hepatotoxicity issues covers a range of liver abnormalities and drug-induced liver injuries. These include increased ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase), which are indicators of liver injury.
- The clinical trials mentioned include JAVELIN Renal 101 and KEYNOTE-426, which investigated the safety of axitinib in combination with avelumab and pembrolizumab, respectively (Section 6.1). In these trials, elevation of liver enzymes, indicative of liver injury, was recorded. The described hepatotoxicity events also encapsulate acute liver injury.
- In the INLYTA plus avelumab group, serious adverse reactions included hepatotoxicity in 1.8% of patients, some of whom required permanent discontinuation or dose interruptions/reductions of the drug due to liver-related adverse events (Section 6.1).

Evidence from Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Section 6.2 indicates that hepatic adverse reactions, such as increased liver enzymes, have been identified and reported through post-marketing surveillance. However, the specific incidence rate or detailed case reports of acute liver injury is not explicitly provided.

Summary:
Overall, the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggests that hepatotoxicity, which could include acute liver injury, is a potential adverse reaction to axitinib. The severity ranges from transient liver enzyme elevations to serious hepatotoxicity, warranting close monitoring, dose adjustment, or drug discontinuation. The clinical documentation does not specify the exact incidence or detailed case presentations solely for acute liver injury, but it is subsumed under the broader category of hepatotoxicity.

Sources:
The information provided in the summary comes from the sections of the drug label provided, namely Sections 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience), 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience), and 5.11 (Hepatotoxicity). These sections report the observed adverse reactions related to liver function and injury in patients treated with axitinib, both alone and in combination with other cancer therapies.","The provided drug label for axitinib (INLYTA) indicates hepatotoxicity as a clinically significant adverse reaction experienced by some patients. Hepatotoxicity is mentioned multiple times across different sections, including Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and the Adverse Reactions section (6.1), indicating its occurrence in clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Specifically, within the Clinical Trials Experience section (6.1), hepatotoxicity is listed as a common adverse reaction when INLYTA is used in combination with other drugs such as avelumab and pembrolizumab, as well as a single agent. Elevated liver enzymes, an indicator of liver injury, were reported, and there were instances of increased ALT and AST levels, which required monitoring and, in some cases, dose adjustments or discontinuation of the drug.

The Warnings and Precautions section (5.11) also describes the need for monitoring liver enzymes before and during treatment with INLYTA, especially when used in combination therapy, since higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 liver enzyme elevations may occur. The section outlines the potential need for withholding INLYTA or the discontinuation of the combination therapy for severe or life-threatening hepatotoxicity. Additionally, when used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, a subset of patients developed immune-mediated hepatitis, further supporting the drug's association with hepatotoxic events.

There is no mention of acute liver injury specifically being refuted as an adverse reaction to axitinib in the provided label sections. Instead, the evidence supports the contrary, validating hepatotoxicity, including liver enzyme elevations and immune-mediated hepatitis, as adverse reactions associated with axitinib use.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label information, the evidence does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to axitinib; rather, it supports hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction related to axitinib usage. No sources were directly cited within the excerpts provided, but data are likely derived from regulatory submission documentation, including clinical trial results and post-marketing surveillance reports that are standard for drug approvals."
acute liver injury,azacitidine,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, there does not appear to be direct evidence linking acute liver injury specifically to azacitidine (VIDAZA) use in the provided drug label sections. However, the label does mention hepatotoxicity as a warning. The warning and precautions section (5.3) notes that azacitidine can be potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment, and it is advised to exercise caution in these patients. It also mentions that patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease and low baseline albumin levels have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment.

The information also indicates contraindications for the use of azacitidine in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors, which suggests that there is a recognized risk of liver-related adverse effects. Additionally, it is recommended that liver chemistries should be monitored prior to the initiation of therapy and with each cycle to watch for potential hepatotoxicity.

In the post-marketing experience section (6.2), while specific reactions such as interstitial lung disease, tumor lysis syndrome, and others are listed, acute liver injury is not directly mentioned. However, since post-marketing surveillance can uncover adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials due to broader and more diverse patient exposure, it's possible that liver-related adverse effects may have occurred but are not specified in the provided sections.

In summary, while there is a warning on the potential for hepatotoxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic conditions, and a contraindication in patients with advanced malignant liver tumors, there is no explicit evidence in the provided sections of acute liver injury being a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to azacitidine in the post-marketing experience. It is essential to monitor liver function when administering azacitidine to patients, particularly those with existing liver issues.",NA
acute liver injury,azathioprine,,"The evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury and azathioprine exposure can be derived from various sources, such as clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance data. The key points from the provided drug label sections are summarized below:

1. **Hepatotoxicity in Clinical Use:**
   - The drug label mentions that hepatotoxicity, characterized by elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and/or serum transaminases, is a known occurrence following the use of azathioprine, particularly in organ transplant recipients.
   - Hepatotoxicity has been reported to be less common (less than 1%) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

2. **Severity and Reversibility:**
   - After transplantation, hepatotoxicity most often occurs within the first 6 months and is generally reversible following the discontinuation of azathioprine. 

3. **Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease:**
   - A rare, but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction of hepatic veno-occlusive disease associated with chronic administration of azathioprine has been described both in transplant patients and in a patient receiving azathioprine for panuveitis. The specific references (11, 12, 13) in the label presumably correspond to case reports or studies documenting this.

4. **Monitoring Recommendations:**
   - The drug label recommends periodic measurement of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin to facilitate early detection of hepatotoxicity.

5. **Case Reports and Studies Reference:**
   - Although not directly cited here, the label's reference to specific cases indicates that there is documented evidence from case studies (references 11, 12, 13).

6. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
   - The label suggests that rare adverse reactions such as hepatic veno-occlusive disease have emerged from post-marketing surveillance data, which includes reports from healthcare providers, patients, and literature sources after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use.

7. **Warnings Provided by Drug Label:**
   - While the evidence of malignancy is more extensively discussed, it is clear from the warnings that liver health is a concern when using azathioprine, necessitating close monitoring.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and azathioprine exposure is supported by evidence from clinical usage patterns, particularly in the transplant patient population, as well as from post-marketing case reports indicating hepatotoxicity, including rare cases of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. The evidence suggests that while hepatotoxicity is relatively uncommon in rheumatoid arthritis patients, it represents a serious and potentially reversible risk, especially within the first 6 months post-transplantation. It is important to have regular liver function tests to monitor for signs of liver injury in patients taking azathioprine.",NA
acute liver injury,azithromycin,,"Evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury and azithromycin exposure can be drawn from several elements within the provided drug label sections, focusing on clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):** In clinical trials, while the most common adverse reactions related to azithromycin involved the gastrointestinal system, potentially serious adverse reactions of cholestatic jaundice were reported, indicating liver involvement. Additionally, the drug-related liver enzyme abnormalities leading to discontinuation of azithromycin were identified, albeit in a small number of cases (four patients discontinued therapy due to liver enzyme abnormalities).

**Laboratory Abnormalities (6.3):** Regarding laboratory tests, which could indicate liver injury, there were clinical trial instances of elevated ALAT, ASAT, and bilirubin. Such abnormalities suggest hepatic dysfunction, which can be related to hepatotoxicity.

**Postmarketing Experience (6.2):** Post-approval, there have been voluntary reports of adverse reactions associated with azithromycin, which include abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure, with some cases resulting in death. While establishing causal relationships based on postmarketing reports can be challenging due to the self-selected reporting nature, the inclusion of these findings indicates observed concerns about liver injury related to azithromycin.

**Warnings and Precautions (5.2 Hepatotoxicity):** The label explicitly warns of severe hepatotoxicity, including instances that have been fatal. It advises the discontinuation of azithromycin if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur, which highlights the recognized risk of hepatotoxicity.

While specific details from individual case studies are not provided in the label, the clinical trial experiences, postmarketing surveillance data, and explicit warnings within the labeling collectively provide evidence of a relationship between azithromycin exposure and the potential for acute liver injury. The presence of hepatotoxicity warnings, including hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, underscores the severity of the potential adverse reaction. Facilities and healthcare providers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to regulatory agencies (such as the FDA), which aids in the ongoing surveillance of drug safety.",NA
acute liver injury,balsalazide,,"Evidence regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and balsalazide use includes information from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

Clinical Trials:
Based on the provided drug label information, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction during the clinical trials for balsalazide, where the adverse events reported in greater or equal to 3% of adults included headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, respiratory infection, and arthralgia. Even in pediatric patients, acute liver injury was not reported as a frequent adverse reaction.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
However, the label does mention hepatotoxicity identified during post-approval use of balsalazide or related products metabolized to mesalamine (the active moiety of balsalazide) under the postmarketing experience section. Specific hepatic adverse reactions listed include ""elevated liver function tests (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, cirrhosis, hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure."" These reports suggest an association between balsalazide (and compounds metabolized to mesalamine) and hepatic dysfunction, including severe outcomes like liver failure.

Warnings and Precautions:
The label's warnings and precautions also include a subsection on hepatic failure, noting that there have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. As balsalazide is converted to mesalamine, there is a direct warning regarding the potential risk of hepatic failure, particularly in patients with known liver impairment.

Case Studies:
There is no detailed mention of case studies in the provided information regarding acute liver injury specifically related to balsalazide use.

In Conclusion:
While acute liver injury is not among the most common adverse reactions reported in the controlled clinical trials for balsalazide, post-marketing data and the drug's label warnings suggest that there is evidence to support hepatic dysfunction, including serious conditions like jaundice, hepatic failure, and liver necrosis, as potential adverse reactions of balsalazide, particularly in patients with underlying liver disease or when exposed to related mesalamine compounds. Health care providers are advised to monitor liver function in patients receiving balsalazide and consider the benefit-risk balance in those with known liver impairment. The evidence comes from post-marketing surveillance reports and label precautions, rather than from data gathered in the initial clinical trials.",NA
acute liver injury,baricitinib,,"To summarize the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and baricitinib (brand name OLUMIANT), we look into the provided label sections that discuss adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials, as well as postmarketing experience.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- The label indicates that treatment with baricitinib was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo.
- During the 16-week treatment period in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) clinical trials, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with OLUMIANT 2 mg and 1.4% of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg.
- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations ≥3 times the ULN occurred in 1.3% of patients treated with OLUMIANT 2 mg, and 0.8% of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg.
- In a phase 3 study of DMARD naive patients, during the 24-week treatment period, ALT and AST elevations ≥3 times the ULN occurred in 4.7% and 1.9% of patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg plus methotrexate, respectively.
- In COVID-19 clinical trials, increases in liver enzymes were also observed as adverse reactions, with ALT and AST elevations ≥3 times the ULN being reported in 18.1% and 11.8% of patients treated with OLUMIANT 4 mg, respectively.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- Postmarketing reports also identified liver enzyme elevations as an adverse reaction, though frequency and causality are less clear due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertain size of the exposed population.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The drug label emphasizes the need for evaluating liver enzymes at baseline and monitoring them according to routine patient management, with a recommendation for prompt investigation if liver enzyme elevations are noted, to exclude drug-induced liver injury. 

Boxed Warnings and Laboratory Abnormalities:
- There is no direct mention of acute liver injury but the label discusses liver enzyme elevations and recommends monitoring which suggests awareness of potential hepatotoxicity.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance suggests that there is an association between baricitinib and liver enzyme elevations, a laboratory marker that can indicate acute liver injury. The data from clinical trials and dosage information on the drug label provide specific percentages of patients who experienced significant elevations in liver enzymes, which is an indication of potential liver injury. Monitoring recommendations are provided in the warnings and precautions section to manage this risk. This evidence confirms that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction of baricitinib.",NA
acute liver injury,bedaquiline,,"Bedaquiline, marketed under the brand name SIRTURO, is a medication used to treat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). According to clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and the drug label information provided, there is evidence to support a relationship between bedaquiline exposure and the potential for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction.

In clinical trials, hepatic-related adverse reactions were reported with the use of bedaquiline plus other drugs used to treat tuberculosis compared to other drugs used to treat tuberculosis without the addition of bedaquiline. Specifically, aminotransferase elevations (indicative of liver injury) of at least 3 times the upper limit of normal developed more frequently in the bedaquiline treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group. In adult clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2), 10.8% of bedaquiline-treated patients experienced such increases in aminotransferase levels versus 5.7% in the placebo group. In a pediatric cohort (5 years to less than 12 years of age), 33% experienced elevations in liver enzymes, leading to the discontinuation of bedaquiline in three patients. These elevations in liver enzymes were reversible upon the discontinuation of bedaquiline and some of the background regimen drugs.

The drug label also includes a ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.4 Hepatotoxicity) that advises on monitoring liver-related laboratory tests and symptoms. It notes that hepatotoxicity may occur with the use of bedaquiline and recommends discontinuation of the drug if evidence of liver injury is observed. Hepatic-related adverse reactions were reported in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.

These findings are sourced from analyses of collected data from clinical studies as denoted in sections 6.1 ""Clinical Studies Experience in Adults"" and ""Clinical Studies Experience in Pediatric Patients"" of the provided label.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials and recommendations in the drug label indicate that there is a relationship between bedaquiline and acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver function and consider the risk of hepatotoxicity when prescribing bedaquiline.",NA
acute liver injury,bedaquiline,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to bedaquiline is primarily derived from its clinical trial data, as detailed in the provided drug label sections.

Clinical Trials:
In clinical trials for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), there was evidence of hepatic-related adverse reactions associated with the use of bedaquiline. Notably, in the pooled safety data from SIRTURO-exposed patients, aminotransferase elevations (indicative of liver injury) of at least three times the upper limit of normal were observed more frequently in the bedaquiline treatment group compared to the placebo group (10.8% vs 5.7%). Specifically, in Study 3, 22 out of 230 patients (9.6%) experienced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal during the overall treatment period.

Pediatric Population:
The label also reports hepatic adverse reactions in pediatric populations. In children aged 5 to less than 12 years, the most common adverse reactions were related to elevations in liver enzymes, accounting for 33% of the patients in this cohort. This condition led to discontinuation of bedaquiline in three patients, indicative of a significant adverse event. It is also stated that elevations in liver enzymes were reversible upon discontinuation of bedaquiline and some of the background regimen drugs.

Warnings and Precautions:
The warnings and precautions section (5.4) of the label specifically addresses hepatotoxicity, stating that more hepatic-related adverse reactions were reported in adults when using SIRTURO plus other drugs to treat TB compared to the use of those drugs without SIRTURO. The label advises monitoring liver-related laboratory tests (such as ALT, AST) before and after the treatment indicating the potential for liver injury.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
Although no specific post-marketing surveillance data are provided within the drug label, mechanisms exist for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions, such as a dedicated contact at Janszen Therapeutics and the FDA's MedWatch program. This allows for ongoing collection of safety data, including hepatotoxicity, which could provide further insight into the relationship between bedaquiline and acute liver injury.

In summary, clinical trials have documented elevated liver enzymes associated with bedaquiline treatment in both adult and pediatric patient populations, indicating a potential for acute liver injury. These findings are supported by the inclusion of hepatotoxicity in the warnings and precautions section of the drug labeling, which suggests careful monitoring of liver function during bedaquiline therapy. No specific post-marketing data are mentioned; however, there is a process in place for continued surveillance of adverse effects.","Evidence that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of bedaquiline cannot be provided based on the drug label information you have supplied, because the drug label explicitly lists hepatotoxicity as a potential side effect of the medication. Specifically, the label includes a warning for hepatotoxicity (section 5.4), and mentions that hepatic-related adverse reactions were reported in adults and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older in clinical trials. Additionally, there are references to increased transaminases (which include liver enzymes AST and ALT) being observed in patients treated with SIRTURO (the brand name for bedaquiline), both in the summary of adverse reactions and detailed clinical trial results.

Therefore, refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and bedaquiline is not possible as there is evidence supporting their association, rather than refuting it. The information provided reflects that hepatotoxicity is a recognized risk of treatment with bedaquiline, and it is advised in the drug label that liver-related laboratory tests should be monitored, and the drug should be discontinued if evidence of liver injury occurs.

NA"
acute liver injury,belinostat,,"The provided drug label sections indicate that hepatotoxicity, which includes the potential for acute liver injury, is an established adverse reaction associated with the use of belinostat. Belinostat is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). 

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The safety of belinostat was evaluated in a clinical trial involving 129 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL (as indicated in the “Clinical Trials Experience” and “Warnings and Precautions” sections). Patients in this single-arm trial were administered belinostat at a dosage of 1,000 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Hepatotoxicity is cited specifically in the “Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.3), indicating that the drug can cause fatal hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities. The drug label advises monitoring liver function tests before treatment and before starting each cycle, and it provides guidance for dosage adjustments or discontinuation in the event of hepatic toxicity. 

Serious Adverse Reactions:
The label reports one treatment-related death associated with hepatic failure. Although the rate is not specified for hepatotoxic events, it is clear that such risks have been observed and are deemed clinically significant.

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Specific case studies and data from post-marketing surveillance are not detailed in the provided sections of the drug label. However, the inclusion of hepatotoxicity in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" segment implies that post-market surveillance and additional clinical experience may have contributed to an understanding of this risk.

In summary, hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, is a recognized adverse reaction to belinostat, supported by clinical trial data and supplemented by regulatory guidance that reflects an assessment of the drug’s risks. The mention of fatal hepatotoxicity and instructions for monitoring and managing liver function test results suggest both seriousness and the need for caution in the use of belinostat, particularly in those with preexisting liver concerns. The label explicitly cautions about the possibility of severe outcomes, underscoring the importance of this adverse reaction in clinical decision-making.","NA

The provided drug label sections explicitly mention hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction of belinostat, with a warning that belinostat can cause fatal hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities. It is stated that one treatment-related death associated with hepatic failure was reported in a clinical trial. Therefore, acute liver injury is recognized as an adverse reaction of belinostat, and there is no evidence refuting this relationship."
acute liver injury,belinostat,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and belinostat exposure can be summarized from the provided drug label sections as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: 
The safety of belinostat was evaluated in a single-arm clinical trial involving 129 patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), who received belinostat at a dosage of 1,000 mg/m^2 administered intravenously on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Although hepatotoxicity is not explicitly listed in the common adverse reactions (nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, anemia, and vomiting), it is described in more detail under the warnings and precautions section of the prescribing information. Therefore, this trial provided a basis for monitoring hepatotoxicity, but the specific frequency of acute liver injury in this trial context is not directly provided.

2. Serious Adverse Reactions:
The drug label reports one treatment-related death associated with hepatic failure in the clinical trial. This suggests that hepatotoxicity, which can manifest as acute liver injury, is a potential serious adverse reaction to belinostat, underscoring the drug's capacity to cause severe liver damage in certain cases.

3. Warnings and Precautions (Hepatotoxicity):
The label explicitly warns that belinostat can cause fatal hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities. Before starting treatment and before the initiation of each cycle, liver function tests are recommended. Additionally, the label advises to interrupt or adjust the dosage depending on the severity of hepatic toxicity, and in severe cases, to permanently discontinue belinostat. This warning indicates that there is recognition of hepatic toxic effects based on clinical trials' data and post-marketing surveillance.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trial experiences and the outlined serious adverse reactions in the drug label indicate that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction of belinostat. This is corroborated by a specific case of treatment-related hepatic failure leading to death and the general warning for hepatotoxicity associated with the drug. Monitoring guidelines for liver function suggest that there is an established link between belinostat exposure and hepatic adverse outcomes, thereby supporting the need for precautionary measures during treatment.",NA
acute liver injury,belumosudil,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for belumosudil, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction in the sections provided. The drug label sections outline various adverse reactions experienced by patients, with an increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) being one of the laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials. Elevated GGT can be an indicator of liver injury, but it is not specific and can be associated with other conditions.

The information provided does not specify acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction (≥20%). The most common adverse reactions listed include infections, asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, edema, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, decreased phosphate, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, decreased lymphocytes, and hypertension.

Regarding liver function tests, there was an observation of increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase in some patients, which is a laboratory abnormality that may suggest liver dysfunction but is not conclusive for acute liver injury. Furthermore, there are other liver-related laboratory abnormalities provided such as increased alkaline phosphatase and increased alanine aminotransferase, which can be associated with liver injury; however, without further data or explicit mention of acute liver injury, no definitive correlation can be made.

Additionally, the summary includes a note on fatal adverse reaction reporting a single case with multi-organ failure, but without further details, it cannot be conclusively linked to acute liver injury.

There was no mention of acute liver injury in the provided adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings from the drug label. Moreover, the ""warnings and precautions"" section does not indicate liver injury as a concern. The lack of explicit mention of acute liver injury suggests that either it was not observed or reported with significant frequency in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance to be warranted as a warning in the drug label information provided.

In conclusion, based on the information available in the sections of the drug label provided for belumosudil, there is no readily available evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that directly supports a relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to belumosudil. It is essential to review the complete prescribing information and consult the latest literature and post-marketing data for any emerging evidence of such adverse reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,bempedoic acid,,"Evaluation of the evidence for a relationship between acute liver injury and bempedoic acid (marketed as NEXLETOL) suggests that there is an association based on the data provided in the drug label. The relevant supporting evidence can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- The data from two placebo-controlled trials, which included 2009 patients treated with NEXLETOL for 52 weeks, reported ""elevated liver enzymes"" as one of the adverse reactions with an incidence of 2.1% in the NEXLETOL-treated group compared to 0.8% in the placebo group (Table 1).
- Specifically, increases in hepatic transaminases (AST and/or ALT) were observed with NEXLETOL, with the most cases being transient, resolving or improving with continued therapy or after discontinuation. Notably, increases to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in AST were present in 1.4% of patients treated with NEXLETOL versus 0.4% of placebo patients, and increases to more than 5 times ULN occurred in 0.4% of NEXLETOL-treated versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients.
- Elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic and not concurrently associated with elevations ≥2 times ULN in bilirubin or with cholestasis.

Postmarketing Experience:
- There are no specific mentions of acute liver injury or severe hepatic adverse events in the postmarketing section of the provided drug label.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials indicates that there is a potential risk for liver enzyme elevations with the use of NEXLETOL, which could suggest a possible risk for acute liver injury, although the data provided does not detail the severity or the clinical consequences of these elevations. No evidence from postmarketing surveillance specifically pointing to acute liver injury has been provided. It is important to monitor liver function tests when prescribing NEXLETOL and to watch for signs and symptoms of liver injury, adjusting treatment as needed. The lack of details on serious liver injury cases or other corroborating data such as case studies limits the ability to fully evaluate the risk for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to this medication.",NA
acute liver injury,bendamustine,,"The evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury and bendamustine exposure is clearly documented in the drug's prescribing information.

Section 6.1, regarding the clinical trials experience, indicates that there were cases of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) observed in patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride. The trials revealed that in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), 34% had bilirubin elevations, with some not having significant increases in AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase). Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients, indicating a severe rise in liver enzymes which could be indicative of liver injury.

In addition, Section 5.7 explicitly states that fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported, with most cases reported within the first three months of starting therapy. It suggests monitoring liver chemistry tests prior to and during bendamustine hydrochloride therapy.

From the postmarketing experience in Section 6.2, the development of hepatic disorders, as a part of the spectrum of adverse reactions during the post-approval use of the drug, was noted, without specific mention of the frequency due to the nature of voluntary reports.

It is important to note that hepatic adverse reactions appear to be a recognized risk of bendamustine treatment, and specific mention of hepatotoxicity in Sections 5.7 and 6.1 implies an established causal relationship.

In summary, hepatotoxicity including acute liver injury is a documented adverse reaction associated with bendamustine exposure, supported by clinical trial findings and post-marketing reports as per the prescribing information. Monitoring liver function is recommended before and during treatment with bendamustine due to the risk of severe liver injury.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for bendamustine, hepatotoxicity is explicitly listed as one of the warnings and precautions (section 5.7), indicating that liver injury is a known risk associated with the drug. Hepatotoxicity, including fatal and serious cases of liver injury, has been reported (section 5.7). Specifically, in the randomized CLL clinical trial, there were reports of Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin and increases in AST and ALT, with Grade 3 or 4 increases in AST and ALT limited to 1% and 3% of patients respectively (sections 6.1).

Thus, in this case, since hepatotoxicity is a documented adverse reaction of bendamustine, refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to bendamustine would be inconsistent with the label and reported evidence. The evidence to claim that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of bendamustine is not supported by the information provided.

Summary: NA

The evidence in the drug label supports the existence of a relationship between drug exposure to bendamustine and hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, rather than refuting it."
acute liver injury,bendamustine,,"The provided drug label sections contain information on adverse reactions associated with the use of bendamustine, marketed as TREANDA. Hepatotoxicity, which includes liver injury, is listed as a warning and precaution. However, the term ""acute liver injury"" specifically is not detailed in this label. Nonetheless, hepatotoxicity as an umbrella term does encompass acute liver injury among other liver-related issues.

Clinical Trials Evidence: 
- In the randomized CLL clinical study, 34% of patients had bilirubin elevations, some without significant elevations in AST and ALT, indicating possible liver involvement. Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients.
- Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively.   These findings collectively suggest that while liver enzymes were elevated in a portion of patients, the incidence of severe liver damage appears to be low.

Postmarketing Experience Evidence:
- The described postmarketing experiences list fatal and serious cases of liver injury related to bendamustine use without specific frequency quantification or explicit mention of ""acute liver injury.""

In summary, there is some clinical evidence from a CLL study of hepatotoxicity associated with bendamustine, with a small percentage of patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 increases in bilirubin, AST, and ALT. Additionally, serious and fatal liver injuries have been reported in the postmarketing period. These findings support that liver injury, possibly including acute liver injury, is a potential adverse reaction of bendamustine. However, the evidence does not detail the exact frequency or clinical characteristics specific to acute liver injury, distinguishing it from a broader category of hepatotoxic events.

acute liver injury,benznidazole,,"Based on the provided label sections, evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to benznidazole comes from post-marketing experience and the known side effects of other nitroimidazole agents, structurally related to benznidazole.

While the clinical trials described (Trial 1, 2, and 3) for benznidazole, performed on pediatric patients with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease, do not explicitly list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, there is mention of increased transaminases in 5% of patients in Trial 1. Increased transaminases are indicators of liver injury, which may suggest a potential for hepatotoxicity, although not conclusively indicating acute liver injury.

Post-marketing experience, as reported in the label, provides evidence from the use of other formulations of benznidazole outside the United States. Hepatitis and toxic hepatitis are listed as adverse reactions, indicating potential liver injury with the use of benznidazole. Moreover, severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure has been reported with metronidazole, a structurally related nitroimidazole agent, though no similar reports specifically for benznidazole are mentioned.

It is important to note that adverse reactions during post-marketing surveillance are less controlled than those observed in clinical trials and, while they suggest a potential association, they do not establish causality. 

In conclusion, there is evidence to suggest a potential relationship between benznidazole and liver injury, as indicated by increased transaminases observed in clinical trials and reported cases of hepatitis and toxic hepatitis from other formulations of benznidazole in post-marketing experience. However, there is no direct evidence from the provided drug label sections that conclusively links benznidazole with acute liver injury. Further investigation or access to full post-marketing surveillance data and peer-reviewed studies would be necessary to establish a more definitive relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,bexarotene,,"The provided drug label sections contain evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and the drug bexarotene. The key points from the label are as follows:

1. Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure are listed under warnings and precautions (Section 5.3), which indicates that these are recognized risks associated with bexarotene use. Liver injury is characterized as elevations in liver chemistry tests, with a higher incidence at initial doses greater than 300 mg/m2/day compared to 300 mg/m2/day. Two patients developed cholestasis, and one patient died of liver failure. 

2. In the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1), liver function test abnormalities were among the adverse reactions that led to dose reduction or discontinuation of bexarotene in at least two patients being treated for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) resolved within one month in 80% of patients after decreasing the dose or stopping the therapy, suggesting a direct association with drug exposure.

3. The label mentions that patients should undergo LFTs before starting treatment and be monitored regularly thereafter, with a specific recommendation to interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin (Section 5.3). This further underscores the concern for liver-related adverse reactions and the need for monitoring.

4. The section on laboratory tests (Section 5.10) highlights the necessity for baseline and periodic monitoring of liver function, which aligns with the recognition of potential hepatic adverse effects.

No information is provided about the specific incidence rates of hepatotoxicity in the provided sections, other than mentioning that certain liver enzyme elevations were observed. Also, there is no mention of case studies or post-marketing surveillance data that specifically address acute liver injury associated with bexarotene, so the summary is confined to the information provided in the clinical trials and the monitoring recommendations in the label.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials, as reflected in the drug label, supports a relationship between bexarotene exposure and acute liver injury, identified as a potential adverse reaction with specific monitoring guidelines and actions to take if abnormalities are detected.",NA
acute liver injury,bicalutamide,,"Evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction to bicalutamide can be derived from a combination of clinical trials data, post-marketing surveillance, and the bicalutamide drug label warnings and precautions.

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:** According to the drug label, there were reports of elevated liver enzymes in patients treated with bicalutamide in combination with an LHRH analog. In the clinical trial data presented, increased liver enzyme tests occurred in 30 (7%) patients taking bicalutamide plus an LHRH analog. Elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, BUN, and creatinine, among other laboratory abnormalities, were reported in both the bicalutamide-treated and the control group treated with flutamide and LHRH analog.

2. **Post-marketing Experience:** The label also mentions that severe hepatic injury and fatal hepatic failure have been observed post-marketing in association with bicalutamide use. These instances generally occurred within the first three to four months of treatment. Hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in approximately 1% of bicalutamide patients in controlled clinical trials.

3. **Warnings and Precautions:** The drug label under section 5.1 specifically addresses hepatitis and liver injury. It indicates that cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury have been reported. Hepatotoxicity typically appeared within the first three to four months of initiating treatment with bicalutamide. Consequently, the label advises monitoring serum transaminase levels before starting treatment, at regular intervals for the first four months, and periodically thereafter. It specifies that if a patient exhibits jaundice or their ALT levels exceed twice the upper limit of normal, bicalutamide should be immediately discontinued with close liver function monitoring.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trial data and post-marketing reports to support that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with the use of bicalutamide, as acknowledged in the drug warning and precautions on the label. Monitoring liver function tests is recommended before and during treatment with bicalutamide to manage this risk.",NA
acute liver injury,bimatoprost,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for bimatoprost, acute liver injury is not listed as a known adverse reaction within the clinical trial experience or the postmarketing experience for this medication. 

In the clinical trial experience detailed in section 6.1, the most frequently reported adverse reactions related to bimatoprost include eye pruritus, conjunctival hyperemia, skin hyperpigmentation, ocular irritation, dry eye symptoms, and periorbital erythema, occurring in less than 4% of patients. Additional reactions noted are foreign body sensation, hair growth abnormal, and iris hyperpigmentation. A further list of adverse reactions associated with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution (LUMIGAN®) for the reduction of intraocular pressure includes ocular dryness, visual disturbance, ocular burning, eye pain, blepharitis, and several others, but does not mention acute liver injury.

The postmarketing experience detailed in section 6.2 reports additional adverse reactions such as dry skin of the eyelid, eye swelling, eyelid edema, hordeolum, and hypersensitivity reactions, among others, but again, does not include acute liver injury.

There is no mention in the warnings and precautions section, specifically sections 5.1 through 5.8, of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction or effect of bimatoprost.

In summary, within the scope of the provided drug label information, there is no documented evidence to support a relationship between acute liver in jury and exposure to bimatoprost from either clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance. Safety monitoring should continue as with any medication, and any new evidence or case reports should be considered in the context of ongoing pharmacovigilance.",NA
acute liver injury,binimetinib,,"The provided sections from the drug label indicate that binimetinib, also known as MEKTOVI, in combination with encorafenib, has a known risk of hepatotoxicity which includes potential liver injury. In the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.6) of the label, there is a specific mention of hepatotoxicity, advising monitoring liver function tests before and during treatment with MEKTOVI and encorafenib.

The ""Clinical Trials Experience"" (6.1) further provides data relating to the incidence of liver function test abnormalities, specifying that in the COLUMBUS trial, Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function tests, specifically alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were observed in 6% of patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. In the PHAROS trial, Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function tests were reported as 10% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 9% for ALT.

These findings suggest that while acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction, there is evidence of hepatotoxic effects, including increased liver enzymes, which can be indicative of liver injury in patients treated with binimetinib in combination with encorafenib. It is important to note that these figures come from controlled clinical trials, and the actual rates of acute liver injury in broader patient populations (post-marketing surveillance) might differ.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials that binimetinib, particularly when used in combination with encorafenib, is associated with hepatotoxicity, which may include acute liver injury. This is supported by observations of elevated liver enzymes in a significant proportion of patients, and by recommendations for liver function monitoring. Clinical judgment should be used to evaluate each patient's risk, and appropriate monitoring should take place during treatment with these medications.",NA
acute liver injury,blinatumomab,,"Evaluation of the evidence provided in the drug label sections for blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) indicates a known association between the drug exposure and hepatic adverse events, specifically elevated liver enzymes. However, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction. Below, key details regarding hepatic effects from the provided sections are summarized:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Elevated liver enzymes were noted in some patients (Section 6.1). However, detailed incidence rates of elevated liver enzymes or acute liver injury specifically related to blinatumomab are not provided within the provided sections.

Warnings and Precautions:
- Elevated Liver Enzymes (Section 5.7) section notes that treatment with BLINCYTO was associated with transient elevations in liver enzymes, indicating a potential for liver-related adverse effects. While the document does not specify acute liver injury, elevated liver enzymes can be indicative of hepatotoxicity or liver injury.
- The document notes that elevations in liver enzymes occurred both in the setting of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and independent of this condition. It also states that Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS, with fewer than 1% leading to treatment discontinuation.

Postmarketing Experience:
- The adverse reactions identified during postapproval use of BLINCYTO do not explicitly include acute liver injury, though other hepatic disorders such as hyperbilirubinemia are listed (Section 6.2).

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is evidence that BLINCYTO is associated with elevated liver enzymes, which are potential markers for liver injury. However, without explicit reporting of acute liver injury either in clinical trial results or postmarketing surveillance as distinct from elevated enzyme levels, the direct relationship between BLinatumomab and acute liver injury cannot be confirmed from the provided label sections. Further investigation into clinical trial data, case studies, and the wider scientific literature would be necessary to characterize this relationship more fully. It is important to consult the full prescribing information and any updates from regulatory agencies or published literature for the most current understanding of drug-associated risks.",NA
acute liver injury,blinatumomab,,"The drug label for blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) provides detailed information on the adverse reactions associated with its use. However, after reviewing the provided sections of the drug label, there is no direct evidence or specific mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to blinatumomab in the sections provided.

Elevations in liver enzymes are noted as an adverse reaction, with hypertransaminasemia (which includes increased alanime aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) being reported (Table 8 and Table 9). Hypertransaminasemia represents a hepatic adverse reaction which can indicate liver injury, but the term ""acute liver injury"" is not used explicitly. The label mentions that the majority of these transient elevations in liver enzymes were observed in the setting of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and for events observed outside the setting of CRS, there were Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes in approximately 7% of patients outside the setting of CRS, which resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients (Section 5.7).

Importantly, hepatobiliary disorders mentioned in the label encompass increased blood bilirubin and hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting that liver-related adverse reactions can occur. However, these findings do not provide a direct causal relationship between blinatumomab and acute liver injury but indicate that liver enzyme elevations, which can be a sign of liver injury, are a known side effect.

Therefore, while there is evidence of liver enzyme elevations associated with blinatumomab from clinical trials, specific evidence linking blinatumomab to acute liver injury would likely require further detailed case studies or post-marketing reports that were not provided in the label sections quoted. If seeking to establish a causal link between blinatumomab and acute liver injury, one would need to investigate case reports, clinical trial data, or post-marketing surveillance data that explicitly document instances of acute liver injury and assess causality. Additionally, the label notes to monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels during treatment, which suggests a potential for liver-related adverse effects (Section 5.7). 

The label's section on postmarketing experience (Section 6.2) does not list acute liver injury, suggesting that, up to the knowledge cutoff date, acute liver injury had not been reported or recognized as a significant concern in the postmarketing setting for blinatumomab.

For a definitive assessment, comprehensive review of clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and case studies beyond the label information is required. It is also important to consider that adverse reactions can be underreported, and the appearance of an adverse reaction post-marketing does not necessarily establish a causal relationship to the drug.",NA
acute liver injury,bortezomib,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury (hepatic toxicity) and bortezomib use. Evidence comes from clinical trials, as well as postmarketing experience.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
1. The drug label mentions hepatic toxicity as an adverse reaction under the Warnings and Precautions section (5.9). It indicates that cases of acute liver failure have been reported in patients receiving multiple concomitant medications and with serious underlying medical conditions. The label advises interrupting bortezomib therapy to assess reversibility in the event of signs of hepatic injury.

2. The serious adverse reactions section within the Integrated Summary of Safety (Relapsed Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma) indicates that liver failure (acute and chronic) has been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

3. Hepatic hemorrhage, hyperbilirubinemia, and hepatitis are also listed under ""Additional Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies,"" suggesting documented cases where bortezomib use was related to hepatic adverse events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Postmarketing Experience Evidence:
1. Hepatobiliary Disorders, including hepatic hemorrhage, hyperbilirubinemia, and portal vein thrombosis, have been reported [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

2. Cases of acute liver failure are mentioned, which occur in a setting of multiple medications and comorbidities, indicating a relationship between bortezomib use and acute liver injury [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Based on these sections, there is evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance that supports acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to bortezomib. Clinicians should monitor hepatic enzymes during bortezomib therapy and consider assessing reversibility upon signs of liver damage, as suggested by the Warnings and Precautions section (5.9). The evidence indicates an increased risk for hepatic events in patients with concurrent medications and underlying medical conditions, underscoring the need for vigilance in these populations. 

Bear in mind that this summary is based on the sections of the drug label provided. Additional data, including other sections of the full label, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), or published literature, might further substantiate the relationship between bortezomib and hepatic toxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,bosentan,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and bosentan exposure is robust and multifaceted, as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
During clinical trials of bosentan, hepatotoxicity manifested as elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT and AST) in approximately 11% of patients, distinguishing it from the placebo group which demonstrated about a 2% incidence rate. These findings are included in the Boxed Warning of bosentan's label. In the clinical trials population (n=658) versus the placebo population (n=280), notable elevations of aminotransferases (>3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) were consistently more frequent among bosentan-treated patients. Furthermore, bilirubin elevations (≥3×ULN) accompanied by aminotransferase increases occurred in a small number of patients, indicating potential serious hepatotoxicity.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
In the real-world setting, postmarketing surveillance has provided additional insight into the hepatotoxic potential of bosentan. The labeling mentions postmarketing reports of hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure where a causal relationship to bosentan cannot be excluded. Additionally, there was at least one reported case of significant liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations after more than 20 months of treatment, which improved after the discontinuation of bosentan. These cases underscore the importance of vigilant liver function monitoring during bosentan therapy.

3. Prescribing and Distribution Program for Bosentan (REMS Program):
Given the risk of hepatotoxicity, bosentan is distributed through a restricted program called the Bosentan REMS Program, which mandates liver function tests prior to therapy initiation and monthly thereafter. This restriction and close monitoring reflect the recognized risk of liver injury associated with bosentan use.

4. Labeling and Recommendations:
Bosentan labeling carries a Boxed Warning for hepatotoxicity, highlighting the potential for liver injury. Recommendations for preemptive monthly monitoring of liver aminotransferases and the instruction to discontinue bosentan in the event of elevated liver enzymes and symptoms of liver dysfunction signify the significance of the identified risk.

In summary, the evidence for a causal relationship between bosentan exposure and acute liver injury originates from results observed in clinical trials, corroborated by postmarketing reports of serious liver injury, necessitating stringent monitoring protocols and a restricted distribution program to mitigate the risk. This rigor in monitoring and alerting healthcare providers to potential hepatotoxicity further substantiates the relationship between bosentan exposure and the risk of acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,bosutinib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and bosutinib exposure is detailed in section 5.3 of the drug label. In clinical trials, bosutinib was associated with elevations of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), indicative of hepatic toxicity. Specifically, two cases in the clinical trials were consistent with drug-induced liver injury, presenting as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than two times the ULN, in the absence of alternative explanations.

The incidence of transaminase elevations (ALT and AST) was notable both in adult and pediatric patients across various clinical trials, with a significant proportion of patients experiencing these adverse reactions early during treatment (typically within the first three months). For adult patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase CML receiving bosutinib, the incidence was about 68% for ALT elevation and 56% for AST elevation. In a single-arm trial with 546 adult patients resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence was 53% for ALT and 47% for AST elevation. Pediatric patients displayed similar trends in hepatic enzyme elevations.

The label information further recommends that hepatic enzyme tests be performed monthly for the first three months of treatment and as clinically indicated afterward. For the management of hepatic toxicity, the label advises monitoring liver enzymes more frequently in patients with transaminase elevations and to withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue bosutinib as required.

This hepatic toxicity profile is serious and noteworthy, and the management requires attention to changes in liver enzymes and potential modifications to dosing or discontinuation of the drug. Thus, the evidence from clinical trials, as detailed in the drug label, clearly supports a relationship between bosutinib exposure and the potential for acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,bosutinib,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and the use of bosutinib from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Here are the relevant details summarized:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- Hepatic toxicity, defined as elevations in serum transaminases (ALT and AST), is listed as one of the adverse reactions to bosutinib and has been observed in both newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients and those who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.
- Two cases consistent with drug-induced liver injury were noted among 1,711 patients in the bosutinib clinical trials.
- In a trial of 268 patients with newly-diagnosed CML treated with bosutinib, the incidence of ALT elevation was 68.3%, and AST elevation was 56%. Many of these transaminase elevations occurred within the first three months of treatment.
- In a single-arm study of 546 patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 53.3% experienced elevated ALT, and 46.7% experienced elevated AST. Again, the majority of cases occurred early during the treatment course.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- Post-marketing reports have identified adverse reactions during the usage of bosutinib, including cases of hepatic dysfunction. Because these reports come from a voluntary reporting system, the exact frequency and causality cannot be firmly established.

The patient should be monitored closely for liver enzyme elevations and managed following standard of care, which may include dosage adjustments, interruption, or discontinuation of the therapy if needed.

Based on the mentioned details, the evidence suggests a clear relationship between bosutinib exposure and the risk of acute liver injury, characterized mainly by transaminase elevations and other liver function test abnormalities. This risk is acknowledged in the warnings and precautions section of the bosutinib label, where hepatic toxicity is explicitly discussed, and monitoring recommendations are provided.",NA
acute liver injury,bremelanotide,,"Evidence for an association between acute liver injury and bremelanotide (marketed as Vyleesi) as an adverse reaction can be summarized based on the provided drug label as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - No significant signal was reported for hepatotoxicity in the initial clinical trials for approval, which included two 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1247 premenopausal women followed by a 52-week open-label uncontrolled extension phase.
   - The drug label does not report acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in the controlled clinical trials phase. The most frequent adverse reactions were nausea, flushing, injection site reactions, headache, and vomiting.

2. Open-label Extension Phase:
   - In the longer-term, open-label extension phase, there was one reported case of acute hepatitis after a patient had received 10 doses of Vyleesi over one year.
   - The patient’s serum transaminases were over 40 times the upper limit of normal, with total bilirubin levels 6 times the upper limit of normal, but alkaline phosphatase was reported to be less than 2 times the upper limit of normal.
   - Liver function tests normalized 4 months following discontinuation of the medication.
   - As no alternative etiology was identified, a definitive causal role for Vyleesi could not be excluded, but it was also not confirmed.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - There is no mention of additional data from post-marketing surveillance provided in the drug label regarding acute liver injury specifically.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting bremelanotide's association with acute liver injury comes from a single reported case in the extended phase of clinical studies, with a recovery upon discontinuation of the drug. The evidence is limited and consists of a case report, which does not establish a clear causal relationship but does suggest a potential association that healthcare providers should be aware of. As liver injury is a serious condition, this finding warrants attention, and healthcare professionals should monitor patients using bremelanotide for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction and consider the benefit-risk balance, especially for those with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking other medications that could impact liver function.",NA
acute liver injury,brentuximab vedotin,,"Evidence supports a relationship between acute liver injury and brentuximab vedotin exposure, as indicated in the provided drug labeling sections. Here are the relevant points focusing on liver injury:

1. **Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ""Hepatotoxicity""**: The label explicitly warns about the potential for hepatotoxicity associated with brentuximab vedotin, stating that both fatal and serious cases have occurred. It mentions liver injury with elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin and advises monitoring liver enzymes and bilirubin. The label also suggests that preexisting liver disease, concomitant medications, and elevated baseline liver enzymes may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity.

2. **Post-Marketing Experience**: The label further indicates hepatotoxicity as one of the adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin). Since these are voluntary reports, it is challenging to quantify the prevalence accurately, but the recognition of such cases post-approval is important for acknowledging a potential risk of hepatic adverse reactions.

3. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Within the clinical trial summaries, there are references to increased alanine aminotransferase (Table 4) and serious adverse reactions that include hepatotoxicity (Table 6). 

4. **Contraindications and Precautions for Population with Liver Impairment (5.7)**: The drug label advises avoiding the use of ADCETRIS in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment due to elevated risks of serious adverse reactions, further emphasizing the drug's potential to cause liver injury.

In summary, clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and warnings/precautions sections of the brentuximab vedotin drug label suggest a clear relationship between the drug and the risk of acute liver injury/adverse hepatobiliary effects. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver function tests and consider hepatotoxicity as a serious adverse reaction potentially necessitating dose modification or discontinuation of treatment.","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label for brentuximab vedotin, hepatotoxicity, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin, is a recognized adverse reaction and is explicitly mentioned under Warnings and Precautions (5.8). There is no evidence within the provided sections refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to brentuximab vedotin. In fact, the label indicates that there have been cases of hepatotoxicity consistent with hepatocellular injury, including fatal outcomes, which suggests a link between the drug and potential liver injury. Therefore, acute liver injury is considered one of the adverse reactions of brentuximab vedotin."
acute liver injury,brentuximab vedotin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and brentuximab vedotin drug exposure can be found in sections of the drug's label that highlight adverse reactions and warnings. Although the provided sections do not explicitly use the term ""acute liver injury,"" there is mention of hepatotoxicity, which implies liver damage, potentially encompassing acute liver injury.

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**
In the drug label, the Hepatotoxicity warning (section 5.8) informs us that fatal and serious cases of hepatotoxicity have occurred with ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) usage. These cases are characterized by elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin and have happened after the first dose or upon rechallenge with the drug. Additionally, the label advises monitoring liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating a recognized concern for drug-induced liver injury.

**Post-Market Surveillance:**
Post-marketing experiences are captured in section 6.2 of the label. It is mentioned that hepatotoxicity, which could be acute liver injury, has been identified during the post-approval use of ADCETRIS. This indicates that, in practice, beyond controlled clinical trial settings, there have been instances of liver injury in patients taking the drug.

**Conclusion:**
There is evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and brentuximab vedotin exposure based on the hepatotoxicity warnings in the label and post-marketing experience reports. It is important to note that these instances require careful monitoring and may necessitate changes in dosage or discontinuation of the medication if hepatotoxicity occurs. 

**Sources of Evidence:**
The sources of the summarized evidence are the stated clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance as recapped in the drug label for ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin), specifically from the warnings section 5.8 ""Hepatotoxicity"" and the post-marketing surveillance section 6.2 ""Post Marketing Experience.""",NA
acute liver injury,brigatinib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for brigatinib (ALUNBRIG), there is evidence that acute liver injury is an identified adverse reaction associated with the drug's exposure. This evidence arises from clinical trial data reported in the label, specifically under the ""Warnings and Precautions"" and ""Adverse Reactions"" sections.

In the ALTA 1L trial, which evaluated ALUNBRIG in patients with advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not previously received an ALK-targeted therapy, liver enzyme elevations were observed. Increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 72% of patients with grade 3 or 4 elevations in 4.5% of patients, while increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 52% of patients with grade 3 or 4 elevations in 5.2% of patients.

In the ALTA trial, AST elevations were seen in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 65% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. ALT elevations were noted in 34% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 AST elevations occurred in 0.9% in the 90 mg group, with no cases in the 90→180 mg group, while grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations did not occur in the 90 mg group and in 2.7% of the 90→180 mg group.

Therefore, the clinical trials identify hepatotoxicity, indicated by the elevations of liver enzymes AST and ALT, as an adverse reaction to brigatinib treatment. Additionally, the label specifies under the ""Warnings and Precautions"" that monitoring of liver function tests is recommended during treatment with ALUNBRIG.

The summary does not include post-marketing surveillance data, as this was not provided in the given drug label sections. For a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between acute liver injury and brigatinib, additional sources including case studies, post-marketing surveillance reports, and the broader scientific literature would typically be considered.

It is essential to monitor patients for liver function test abnormalities while on ALUNBRIG and manage as per the guidance in the label, which may include withholding the drug, dose reduction, or discontinuation depending on the severity of the liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,bupivacaine,,"The provided drug label information for bupivacaine does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a reported adverse reaction during clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. Most common adverse reactions mentioned are related to the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, including symptoms such as anxiety, dizziness, tremors, convulsions, respiratory arrest, cardiac disturbances, and allergic-type reactions.

Section 5.10 of the 'Warnings and Precautions' does allude to the potential risks associated with hepatic impairment, indicating that care should be taken with patients who have moderate to severe liver dysfunction due to the metabolism of bupivacaine by the liver. While this suggests a recognition that hepatic function can influence bupivacaine's effects, it does not directly correlate to acute liver injury as an adverse reaction.

Furthermore, the label advises close monitoring for systemic toxicity, particularly in patients with hepatic impairment, which may indirectly suggest that bupivacaine could have detrimental effects on the liver, especially in susceptible individuals or at higher dosages.

In conclusion, based on the label information provided, there is no clearly established evidence linking bupivacaine directly to acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. However, caution is advised when using bupivacaine in patients with liver dysfunction, which suggests there is awareness of potential hepatic risks. To determine the relationship between bupivacaine and acute liver injury, further analysis of clinical data and peer-reviewed literature beyond the drug label may be necessary.",NA
acute liver injury,buprenorphine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is evidence to suggest that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction to buprenorphine exposure. Here is a summary of the relevant evidence:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - The safety profile of buprenorphine was supported by clinical trials that included 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses used for the treatment of opioid addiction.
   - While specific instances of acute liver injury are not detailed in the provided clinical trial data, the summary does not denote acute liver injury as a common adverse event observed in these settings.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - The section on postmarketing experience does not specifically mention acute liver injury but lists various adverse reactions identified through post-approval use of buprenorphine.
   - These reactions may not have appeared in the clinical trials and could include severe outcomes not listed in the clinical trial summaries due to the spontaneous nature of reporting and the larger, more diverse population exposed after marketing.

3. Warnings and Precautions about Hepatitis and Hepatic Events (Section 5.8):
   - Buprenorphine is associated with cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice observed in clinical trials and postmarketing adverse event reports.
   - The range of hepatic abnormalities includes transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to cases of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy.
   - The evidence suggests that while there may be other contributing factors such as pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, hepatitis B or C infection, or use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, buprenorphine may have had a causative or contributory role in the development of hepatic abnormalities in some cases.
   - Recommendations include liver function tests before treatment initiation and periodic monitoring during treatment.

In conclusion, while the most common adverse reactions related to buprenorphine do not typically include acute liver injury, the drug label does indicate that buprenorphine has been associated with hepatic events, including serious cases of acute liver injury. These associations are drawn from both clinical trial observations and postmarketing adverse event reports, indicating that there is evidence supporting the relationship between buprenorphine exposure and potential acute liver injury. Monitoring liver function tests is advised prior to and during buprenorphine treatment.",NA
acute liver injury,bupropion,,"**Summary of Evidence: Acute Liver Injury and Bupropion Exposure**

**Clinical Trials Experience ([Section 6.1](#6.1-Clinical-Trials-Experience))**:
During the clinical development of bupropion hydrochloride tablets, 2,400 subjects and healthy volunteers were exposed to the drug. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in approximately 10% of participants. Reported adverse reactions included neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, neurological, and dermatologic events. Specific to hepatic issues, the adverse reaction section ([Section 6.1](#6.1-Clinical-Trials-Experience)) and summary of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction or as a specific cause for treatment discontinuation.

**Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Development ([Section 6.1](#6.1-Clinical-Trials-Experience))**:
Adverse reactions encompass a range of organ systems, with liver damage/jaundice being classified as an infrequent gastroenterological event, although the precise risk, frequency, and characterization as acute liver injury are not described.

**Postmarketing Experience ([Section 6.2](#6.2-Postmarketing-Experience))**:
Postmarketing reports, which follow the approval and widespread use of a drug, have identified adverse reactions not described elsewhere on the drug label. In this surveillance, there is explicit mention of hepatitis as an adverse event. While hepatitis can imply acute liver injury, the label does not quantify how often this reaction occurs or solidly establish a causal relationship to bupropion exposure due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the uncertainty of the reporting population size. 

**Conclusion:**
Evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and bupropion exposure is not extensively detailed or quantified in the drug’s labeling from provided sections. Acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials ([Section 6.1](#6.1-Clinical-Trials-Experience)), but there is a mention of liver damage/jaundice as an infrequent event without explicit characterization as acute. Postmarketing surveillance ([Section 6.2](#6.2-Postmarketing-Experience)) suggests hepatitis, which can be associated with acute liver injury, as an adverse reaction but does not provide a direct causal link or frequency to establish a robust relationship. Therefore, while there is an indication of possible liver-related adverse reactions, the evidence does not strongly establish a definite or frequent association with acute liver injury specifically due to bupropion exposure based on the details provided in the drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,busulfan,1.0,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and busulfan exposure can be summarized from the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. This evidence is derived from the use of Busulfan Injection in a clinical setting for allogeneic stem cell transplants, alongside extensive literature reviews of high-dose oral busulfan in similar transplantation settings.

In the context of Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (HVOD), a specific type of acute liver injury, the evidence is as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - In a clinical trial of Busulfan Injection involving allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n=61), HVOD was diagnosed in 8% of patients and was fatal in 40% of those cases, leading to an overall mortality due to HVOD of 3% in the study population.
   - High busulfan area under the curve (AUC) values greater than 1,500 µM•min have been suggested in the literature to be associated with an increased risk of developing HVOD.
   - HVOD incidence in randomized, controlled trials identified through literature reviews was reported between 7.7% and 12%.

2. Post-Marketing Experience:
   - While post-marketing data does not always allow for a reliable estimate of frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to voluntary nature and uncertain population size, HVOD is recognized as an adverse reaction in this context.

3. Laboratory Monitoring:
   - Patients administered Busulfan are advised to monitor serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28 to detect hepatotoxicity, which could indicate the onset of HVOD.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that acute liver injury, notably HVOD, is an adverse reaction related to busulfan exposure. This relationship is supported by the diagnosis of HVOD in patients treated with Busulfan Injection during clinical trials, the established association with high busulfan AUC levels, and the recognition of HVOD in post-marketing reports. Monitoring guidelines for hepatic function in patients receiving busulfan highlight the importance of this potential adverse reaction.","NA

The evidence provided in the sections you've shared discusses multiple adverse reactions associated with busulfan, however, acute liver injury itself is not explicitly mentioned. The closest related condition is Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (HVOD), which involves damage to the liver, but it is a distinct pathological entity and is recognized as a risk associated with busulfan usage, particularly at high AUC levels.

No evidence is supplied in the given sections that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and busulfan. Without additional data or studies that directly investigate the lack of association between acute liver injury and busulfan, it is not possible to provide a summary of evidence refuting the relationship. If there are studies disproving this connection, they were not included in the text provided."
acute liver injury,cabotegravir,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cabotegravir (marketed as APRETUDE), hepatotoxicity is listed as a potential adverse reaction based on clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Here's a summary of the evidence related to acute liver injury:

1. Clinical Trials Evidence:
   - Adverse reactions to cabotegravir, including hepatotoxicity, were reported during the analysis of data from two international, multicenter, double-blind trials known as HPTN 083 and HPTN 084. These trials involved the administration of APRETUDE extended-release injectable suspension and oral cabotegravir tablets as oral lead-in to study participants.
   - Both trials reported instances where participants discontinued due to hepatotoxicity. In HPTN 083, the adverse event leading to discontinuation occurring in ≥1% of participants was increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In HPTN 084, increased ALT was reported as the most commonly occurring adverse event leading to discontinuation, though it was reported in <1% of participants. 

2. Laboratory Abnormalities from Clinical Trials:
   - Table 6 from the drug label indicates the laboratory abnormalities related to hepatic enzymes. In HPTN 083, Grade 3 or 4 ALT abnormalities occurred in 2% of participants receiving APRETUDE and 2% of participants receiving TRUVADA. In HPTN 084, Grade 3 or 4 ALT abnormalities occurred in less than 1% of APRETUDE recipients and 1% of TRUVADA recipients.

3. Less Common Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials:
   - Hepatotoxicity was listed as one of the select adverse reactions that occurred in <1% of participants receiving APRETUDE in the clinical trials HPTN 083 or HPTN 084.

4. Postmarketing Surveillance:
   - Hepatotoxicity has been identified during postmarketing use of cabotegravir-containing regimens. However, because these reports are voluntary and from a potentially uncertain population size, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In summary, hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, has been associated with the use of cabotegravir based on clinical trial observations and postmarketing reports. These findings support the inclusion of hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction in the drug labeling, prompting a warning to monitor liver function and to consider discontinuing APRETUDE if hepatotoxicity is suspected (Warnings and Precautions, 5.5).

Please note that while the instances of hepatotoxicity in clinical trials appear to be relatively low in frequency, the postmarketing data suggests that the risk persists beyond the clinical trial settings. It is important for healthcare professionals to closely monitor patients receiving cabotegravir for signs of liver injury and to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate regulatory agencies.",NA
acute liver injury,cabozantinib,,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury as an Adverse Reaction of Cabozantinib:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- Liver injury-related adverse reactions were reported from the clinical trials CABOSUN, METEOR, CELESTIAL, and CHECKMATE-9ER.
- As monotherapy, cabozantinib showed increased liver enzymes: AST (Grade 3-4 in 3% of RCC patients and 2% of HCC patients) and ALT (Grade 3-4 in 3% of RCC patients and 2% of HCC patients).
- In combination with nivolumab (CHECKMATE-9ER), Grade 3-4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients.
- Hepatotoxicity was one of the most common adverse reactions in CABOMETYX and nivolumab combination therapy.
- Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with CABOMETYX showed higher rates of Grade 3-4 AST and ALT elevation.
- Liver-related adverse reactions led to dose interruptions, reductions, and in some instances, permanent discontinuation of treatment.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- Hepatic adverse events have been identified during the post-approval use of CABOMETYX, though the frequency is not reliably estimable and causal relationships are not always clear.

Warnings and Precautions on Drug Label:
- Hepatotoxicity is listed under Warnings and Precautions, highlighting a risk when cabozantinib is used alone or in combination with other agents (like nivolumab).
- Monitoring liver enzymes before initiation and throughout treatment is recommended.
- Dose modification guidelines are provided for managing liver enzyme elevations.

Conclusion:
The evidence supports that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with cabozantinib use. This is documented in the adverse reactions section of the drug label and supported by clinical trial data and post-marketing experience. The drug label advises monitoring liver enzymes due to the potential for hepatotoxicity, which may manifest as increased AST and ALT levels, and includes guidance on modifying doses or discontinuing treatment if severe liver injury occurs.

Sources of Evidence:
1. Clinical trial data from studies CABOSUN, METEOR, CELESTIAL, and CHECKMATE-9ER as detailed in the drug label.
2. Post-marketing surveillance data as reported in the drug label.
3. Warnings and precautions section of the drug label for cabozantinib, which addresses potential hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,cabozantinib,,"The provided drug label sections for cabozantinib (COMETRIQ) indicate various adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in patients undergoing treatment, but they do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. The reported laboratory abnormalities include increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, which are enzymes related to liver function. In clinical practice, elevated AST and ALT levels can be indicative of liver injury or hepatotoxicity.

Regarding the clinical trial experience mentioned in the drug label (Section 6.1), the safety of COMETRIQ was evaluated in 330 patients with progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Increased AST and ALT were among the most common laboratory abnormalities in patients treated with cabozantinib, occurring in 86% of the patients for both enzymes. These findings suggest a hepatic effect; however, the label does not directly attribute this to acute liver injury, nor does it mention the clinical manifestations or severity of liver damage.

Other adverse reactions that were frequently observed in the treatment group compared to placebo include diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, oral pain, hair color changes, dysgeusia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and constipation.

Furthermore, the post-marketing experience (Section 6.2) includes a reference to hepatitis cholestatic as a less common adverse reaction, which suggests liver involvement, but again the link to acute liver injury is not explicitly made.

In summary, while there is evidence of liver enzyme elevations (increased AST and ALT) in patients taking cabozantinib, the provided sections of the drug label do not offer specific evidence that directly associates cabozantinib with acute liver injury as a characterized adverse reaction. Elevated liver enzymes may warrant monitoring and further evaluation for potential liver damage, but the relationship to acute liver injury would require more detailed investigation or clinical evidence outside of what is provided in the label sections.",NA
acute liver injury,calaspargase pegol,,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Related to Calaspargase Pegol:

Relevant sections of the drug label for calaspargase pegol, an anti-cancer medication used as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), suggest an association with hepatotoxic adverse reactions.

1. Clinical Trials Evidence:
- Study DFCI 11-001: This clinical trial data shows that elevated transaminase levels, which are markers of liver injury, were observed in 52% of patients treated with calaspargase pegol, while increased bilirubin, another liver function marker, was seen in 20% of patients. These findings suggest liver stress or damage.
- Study AALL07P4: This study also evaluated the safety of calaspargase pegol and included monitoring liver function as part of the safety assessment. Although specific incidences of liver injury are not detailed from this source, monitoring for liver toxicity indicates awareness of the potential for hepatotoxicity.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance:
- Adverse reactions identified post-approval, reported voluntarily via post-marking surveillance, have included cases of hepatotoxicity and veno-occlusive disease (VOD), a severe form of liver injury. This suggests that after the drug's approval, additional instances of liver injury were observed, strengthening the evidence of an association.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
- Hepatotoxicity is specifically mentioned within the Warnings and Precautions section of the drug label, indicating that there is known risk for severe liver toxicity, including potentially fatal hepatic VOD. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended prior to and during treatment with calaspargase pegol.

4. Box Warnings:
- No specific box warning is provided regarding acute liver injury, but hepatotoxicity is noted to be a concern in the Warnings and Precautions section.

In summary, there is evidence from both clinical trial data and post-marketing reports to support the relationship between calaspargase pegol exposure and the risk of acute liver injury, including severe conditions such as VOD. The drug label recommends regular liver function monitoring, signifying recognition of the potential adverse reaction by healthcare professionals. Although exact rates of incidence from the drug label are not available, the inclusion of liver injury in the Warnings and Precautions indicates its clinical relevance.","Based on the information provided in the drug label, acute liver injury, including hepatotoxicity and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), is listed as a potential adverse reaction of calaspargase pegol (ASPARLAS). The warnings and precautions section (5.5) of the label specifically mentions hepatotoxicity, including severe and potentially fatal cases of hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD), and advises monitoring liver function tests. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to assert that there is evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and calaspargase pegol. NA"
acute liver injury,capecitabine,,"The provided drug label information for capecitabine (Xeloda) details extensive adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and warnings and precautions associated with its use. However, acute liver injury is not prominently listed as a common adverse reaction directly in the provided sections. Despite this, there are related hepatic adverse events mentioned, such as hyperbilirubinemia and increased transaminase levels.

Here are the relevant findings from the information provided:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: Hyperbilirubinemia has been reported as a common adverse reaction (see Section 6.1). Hyperbilirubinemia is a condition characterized by an elevated level of bilirubin in the blood and can be an indicator of liver injury or dysfunction. Grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 15% of patients, and grade 4 occurred in 3.9% of patients.

2. In patients with metastatic breast cancer who received capecitabine with docetaxel, grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 7% and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 2%.

3. Post-marketing Experience: Post-marketing data indicates hepatic failure as a recognized adverse reaction (see Section 6.2). However, since post-marketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, establishing a definitive causal relationship to capecitabine exposure is challenging.

4. Warnings and Precautions: Hepatic function should be monitored due to the risk of severe adverse reactions. Patients with existing hepatic impairment may require dose adjustments or discontinuation if they experience further liver-related adverse events (see Section 5.10).

In summary, while the label does not report acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, there is evidence of hepatic-related toxicity, such as hyperbilirubinemia and liver failure, from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. These findings suggest that liver function may be adversely affected in some patients taking capecitabine and that monitoring for signs of liver injury is warranted. Health care providers should be vigilant and perform appropriate assessments and interventions based on the patient's clinical condition.",NA
acute liver injury,capmatinib,,"The summary of evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) as an adverse reaction of capmatinib is predominantly drawn from clinical trial data, as there are no direct mentions of post-marketing surveillance or case studies provided in the extract.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The safety evaluation of capmatinib was conducted in the GEOMETRY mono-1 trial where patients received 400 mg of capmatinib orally twice daily. Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with capmatinib as follows:

- Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was observed in 15% of the patients, with Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT/AST occurring in 7% of patients.
- A subset of patients (0.8%) discontinued capmatinib due to increased ALT/AST.
- The median time to onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST was reported as 1.8 months.
- The drug label advises monitoring liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of capmatinib treatment, every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, and then monthly or as needed.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label under section 5.2 ""Hepatotoxicity"" corroborates the findings of hepatotoxicity during capmatinib's clinical trials and provides guidance for monitoring liver function tests and recommendations for withholding, dose reducing, or permanently discontinuing capmatinib based on the severity of the liver injury. 

No specific information is given about post-marketing surveillance or individual case studies that would provide further insight into acute liver injury related to capmatinib outside of the trial setting.

In conclusion, clinical trial data, as seen in the GEOMETRY mono-1 trial, provides evidence of acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) as a potential adverse reaction to capmatinib. The drug label clearly outlines the occurrence and management of this adverse reaction in the clinical setting.",NA
acute liver injury,carbamazepine,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and carbamazepine exposure is drawn directly from the drug's label under the ""Liver"" subsection within the ""ADVERSE RECTIONS"" section. Specifically, it mentions ""Abnormalities in liver function tests, cholestatic and hepatocellular jaundice, hepatitis, very rare cases of hepatic failure."" This label information is a result of accumulated data from various sources, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, and reflects the regulatory body's assessment of the drug's safety profile.

While the label does not detail the individual studies or reports, the inclusion of liver-related adverse reactions indicates that there is evidence of a causal link supported by observed cases. Post-marketing surveillance is particularly valuable for identifying rare adverse events such as hepatic failure, which may not be seen in clinical trials due to the limited number of participants and the duration of the trials compared to the vast population exposed to the drug after its approval.

In addition to the listing of possible liver-related adverse effects, the presence of severe adverse reactions in the label's ""BOXED WARNING"" and other sections reflect the drug's potential to cause significant harm, although the most severe reactions noted are hematologic and dermatologic. Nevertheless, healthcare providers are advised to monitor patients for signs of liver dysfunction during carbamazepine therapy and to consider discontinuing the drug if evidence of significant liver injury develops.

In summary, the drug label for carbamazepine, a source that compiles clinical, regulatory, and post-marketing data, confirms that acute liver injury can occur as an adverse reaction to carbamazepine. However, specific clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance statistics are not provided in the details you supplied.",NA
acute liver injury,carboplatin,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction to carboplatin therapy in the provided drug label information, nor is it commonly recognized as a hallmark side effect of the drug. However, there are references to hepatic toxicity. The evidence from the label includes reports on increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which can be indicators of liver damage or dysfunction.

Summary of Evidence:

1. Clinical Trials:
   In the summary of adverse experiences from clinical trials listed on the drug label, increases in liver function tests (bilirubin, SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase) have been documented in patients with normal baseline values: total bilirubin (5%), SGOT (15%), and alkaline phosphatase (24%). These values were elevated in greater percentages among pretreated ovarian cancer patients: bilirubin (5%), SGOT (19%), alkaline phosphatase (37%). While these lab changes suggest some degree of liver impact, severe liver abnormalities were reported mainly in a limited series of patients receiving very high dosages of carboplatin and autologous bone marrow transplantation.

2. Case Studies:
   There are no specific case studies cited in the provided sections of the drug label that document a direct relationship between acute liver injury and carboplatin use.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   In the category of other events mentioned in the post-marketing surveillance section, there are no reported cases of acute liver injury. However, abnormalities in liver function tests have been noted, which are generally reversible and may be confounded by metastatic disease to the liver.

Conclusion:
Based on the information provided from the label, there is evidence of mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation in patients using carboplatin, which could suggest potential hepatic toxicity. This, however, does not necessarily confirm acute liver injury as a common or highlighted adverse reaction to the drug. It is important to be aware of these liver-associated lab changes for monitoring purposes, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or in those receiving high doses of the drug. Clinical judgment should be used to discern the exact nature of these changes, whether they are due to the drug or the underlying disease process.

Given the lack‐of‐specific data concerning acute liver injury as a direct adverse effect of carboplatin in the provided drug label sections, healthcare professionals should refer to the latest clinical literature and post-marketing surveillance reports for any emerging evidence of such a relationship and should report novel cases to improve understanding of carboplatin's safety profile.",NA
acute liver injury,carfilzomib,,"Evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance indicates that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of the drug carfilzomib, which is marketed under the brand name Kyprolis.

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   Clinical trials have provided evidence of hepatic toxicity and hepatic failure related to carfilzomib administration. The trials described in the drug label document occurrences of liver enzyme elevations and hepatic adverse events. Detailed analysis of these trials, as listed under section 6.1 of the drug label, reveals the following:

   - The pooled safety population from multiple trials (ASPIRE, ENDEAVOR, A.R.R.O.W., CANDOR, IKEMA, EQUULEUS, PLEIADES) with 2,239 patients exposed to Kyprolis in combination with other drugs reported adverse reactions related to hepatic toxicity.
   - Specific trials cited in the label (such as CANDOR) mention serious adverse reactions, including the evaluation of hepatic enzymes and clinical cases of hepatic failure. 
   - Table 16 lists laboratory abnormalities, including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which is a marker of liver injury, showing an increased incidence in patients treated with Kyprolis combinations.

2. Warnings and Precautions:
   The drug label under section 5.12 highlights the need for monitoring liver enzymes regularly regardless of baseline values and indicates potential hepatic toxicity and hepatic failure associated with carfilzomib. This section advises withholding the drug if hepatic toxicity is suspected, which acknowledges the relationship between drug exposure and liver injury.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   Post-marketing experience, as detailed in section 6.2 of the label, has reported cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, during treatment with Kyprolis. While these post-marketing reports involve voluntary reporting and the frequency cannot be reliably estimated, they contribute to the recognition of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to carfilzomib.

In summary, the evidence from sections 6 (clinical trials), 5 (warnings and precautions), and post-marketing reports all point to acute liver injury being a potential adverse reaction of carfilzomib. These sources collectively present findings from tightly controlled clinical studies as well as observations from broader patient populations following the drug's approval and widespread use. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and other clinical parameters is recommended to rapidly identify and manage this adverse effect in patients receiving Kyprolis.",NA
acute liver injury,carfilzomib,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for carfilzomib (Kyprolis), there is evidence to suggest a relationship between carfilzomib exposure and the potential adverse reaction of hepatic toxicity, which includes acute liver injury. The following points summarize the findings:

1. Risk of Hepatic Toxicity: Hepatic toxicity and hepatic failure, including fatal outcomes, are explicitly noted in the Warnings and Precautions (5.12) section of the label. Although acute liver injury is not mentioned by name, these conditions can encompass injury to the liver.

2. Clinical Trials Experience: Hepatic toxicity, including hepatic failure and hyperbilirubinemia, were reported as adverse reactions (< 10%) during clinical trials in patients treated with Kyprolis (see Adverse Reactions section). This data indicates that liver-related adverse effects were observed and recorded during the trial phases.

3. Monitoring and Management: The drug label recommends regular monitoring of liver enzymes, regardless of baseline values, and advises reducing or withholding the dose of carfilzomib if hepatic toxicity is suspected (see Warnings and Precautions 5.12). This highlights the concern for potential liver-related adverse effects and the need for vigilance in patients receiving carfilzomib.

4. Postmarketing Experience: In the Postmarketing Experience section, other hepatic-related adverse reactions like cholestasis and hyperbilirubinemia have been voluntarily reported. While the frequency and causality in relation to carfilzomib are uncertain, this information contributes to the overall understanding of potential hepatic adverse effects.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting a relationship between carfilzomib exposure and acute liver injury includes reported hepatic toxicity and failure in clinical trials, as well as postmarketing reports of liver-related adverse reactions. The drug label advises monitoring and provides guidance for managing such hepatic events, indicating recognition of the risk by medical authorities.

Please note that the majority of patients in the clinical trials did not experience these adverse reactions. As always, the determination of therapy with carfilzomib should be made by a healthcare provider based on an individual patient’s benefit-risk assessment.",NA
acute liver injury,cariprazine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for cariprazine (VRAYLAR), there is no direct evidence to suggest that acute liver injury is a commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.

The Clinical Trials Experience section details adverse reactions occurring in VRAYLAR-treated patients during placebo-controlled studies for the treatment of various conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar mania, bipolar depression, and as adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Adverse reactions described include extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, dyspepsia, vomiting, somnolence, restlessness, and others. Furthermore, changes in laboratory tests indicate that some patients experienced elevations in transaminases (hepatic enzymes), suggesting some degree of liver enzyme alterations. However, this does not specifically equate to ""acute liver injury.""

Elevations in hepatic enzymes are one element detailed in the Clinical Trials Experience section, which states:

- In 6-week schizophrenia trials, 1% to 2% of VRAYLAR-treated patients experienced transaminase elevations ≥3 times the upper limit of normal, increasing with dose, compared to 1% for placebo-treated patients.
- In 3-week bipolar mania trials, 2% to 4% of VRAYLAR-treated patients had similar transaminase elevations, depending on the dose group, compared to 2% for placebo-treated patients.
- In 6-week and 8-week bipolar depression trials, 0% to 0.5% of VRAYLAR-treated patients experienced these transaminase elevations, with a 0.4% incidence for placebo-treated patients.
- For adjunctive treatment of MDD, the incidence was 0% to 1% for VRAYLAR-treated patients compared to 0% for placebo patients.

While these enzyme elevations could be indicative of hepatic stress or injury, the label does not report the occurrence of acute liver injury as a significant adverse reaction. It is important to note that raised liver enzymes require clinical context to evaluate their significance and do not automatically indicate acute liver injury.

The Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation section does mention ""hepatitis"" under hepatobiliary disorders, but it is classified as ""rare,"" and no specific context is provided that directly links cariprazine to acute liver injury as a notable adverse effect.

In the Postmarketing Experience section, only Stevens-Johnson syndrome is listed as an identified adverse reaction, with no mention of acute liver injury or related issues.

Based on the information provided, there is an indication that cariprazine can cause alterations in liver enzymes in a small percentage of patients, which could potentially signify liver stress. However, there is no described evidence from the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data provided in the drug label that explicitly links cariprazine to the occurrence of acute liver injury. It is always recommended to review the most current and comprehensive data sources for any updates or additional post-marketing reports that may provide further insight into this potential adverse reaction.","Based on the provided drug label information for cariprazine (VRAYLAR), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a common or well-characterized adverse reaction associated with its use. However, the sections on ""Adverse Reactions"" and ""Changes in Laboratory Tests"" do indicate that there were some instances of ""Hepatic enzyme increased"" and transaminase elevations in clinical trials, but these do not necessarily equate to acute liver injury.

The reported adverse reactions include:
- Increases in hepatic enzymes: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were reported with an incidence of ≥2% and greater than placebo at any dose in schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials. However, transaminase elevations of ≥3 times the upper limits of normal were reported at a rate of 1-2% in schizophrenia trials, increasing with dose, and 1% in placebo-treated patients, indicating a dose-response relationship without an overtly high incidence of severe liver injury. In bipolar mania trials, these elevations ranged from 2-4% depending on the dose, which is similar to the placebo rate of 2%. In bipolar depression trials, the range was 0-0.5% for cariprazine-treated patients, depending on the dose administered, and 0.4% for placebo-treated patients. Transaminase elevations of ≥3 times the upper limits of normal range in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials were between 0% and 1% for cariprazine-treated patients, again similar to placebo.

It's important to note that increases in liver enzymes do not always signify acute liver injury but may indicate potential liver stress or damage, which could progress to liver injury if the drug exposure continues in the presence of an underlying risk factor or in cases of overdose. The label advises monitoring patients for signs of liver damage, suggesting that there is a recognized potential for hepatic effects, although it may not be common.

Therefore, while the evidence does not conclusively refute the relationship between acute liver injury and cariprazine, acute liver injury does not appear to be a commonly reported adverse reaction or one that is clearly established based on the information in the provided drug label.

For a comprehensive safety evaluation, further data from post-marketing surveillance, case reports, and additional clinical studies would be beneficial in assessing the incidence and nature of hepatic adverse events related to cariprazine usage. It is recommended to monitor liver function tests in patients on cariprazine, especially in those with pre-existing liver conditions as a precaution."
acute liver injury,carmustine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for carmustine, evidence supports acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to the drug. Hepatotoxicity is explicitly mentioned under the ""Adverse Reactions"" section of the label with the identification of increased transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels, which are indicative of liver injury. These hepatic abnormalities suggest that carmustine can cause liver damage, and the presentation of such laboratory findings could be symptomatic of acute liver injury.

The specific sources of evidence and their nature, whether from clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing reports, are not detailed in the label excerpts provided. The label does note, however, that some adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. This statement implies that the evidence for hepatotoxicity may include post-marketing surveillance data and voluntary reporting, which can be less rigorous than controlled clinical trial data, but still indicative of a potential problem seen in the wider patient population.

No further details on the incidence, severity, or clinical characteristics of the acute liver injury related to carmustine use are given in the label sections provided. Additional research and detailed review of clinical literature would be necessary to provide a more in-depth assessment of the frequency and seriousness of acute liver injury associated with carmustine, as well as to determine if specific patient factors are associated with an increased risk.

In summary, clinical evidence supports a causal relationship between carmustine exposure and hepatotoxicity, which may manifest as acute liver injury, based on increased liver enzyme levels reported as adverse reactions. Further investigation into clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing reports is warranted to fully characterize the risk and underlying mechanisms.",NA
acute liver injury,caspofungin,1.0,"**Summary of Evidence on Acute Liver Injury and Caspofungin (CANCIDAS)**

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
- Hepatic adverse reactions, including increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were observed in clinical trials involving adult patients treated with caspofungin.
- In a study of febrile neutropenic patients, hepatic adverse reactions were reported in 39% of patients in the CANCIDAS group compared to 45% in the AmBisome group, with isolated cases of serious adverse reactions like hyperbilirubinemia.
- Similar observations of increased hepatic enzymes and bilirubin were noted in randomized, double-blinded studies of CANCIDAS in patients with invasive candidiasis.
- In pediatric patients, increased AST and ALT were among the adverse reactions reported.
- Biochemical markers indicative of liver injury, such as increased liver enzymes, were among the more commonly reported laboratory abnormalities during clinical trials of caspofungin, suggesting a potential association with liver injury.
  
**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
- Post-marketing experience has identified hepatic necrosis and hepatitis as adverse reactions, although the frequency is not reliably estimated, and a clear causal relationship to caspofungin is not established. 

**Warnings/Precautions on Label:**
- The label warns that caspofungin can cause abnormalities in liver enzymes and isolated cases of hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure have been reported. However, establishing a causal relationship between these occurrences and caspofungin has not been definitive.
- Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during caspofungin therapy are advised to be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function, and evaluation for the risk/benefit of continuing therapy is recommended.
- When used concomitantly with cyclosporine, an increase in liver enzymes has been reported; hence, monitoring is necessary, and the label advises weighing the potential benefits against the risks.

**Conclusion:**
Clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance indicate that adverse hepatic effects, including acute liver injury, are potential reactions in both adult and pediatric patients taking caspofungin. The evidence suggests a need for careful monitoring of liver function in patients on caspofungin therapy, particularly in those with risk factors for hepatic injury or when used in combination with other hepatotoxic agents such as cyclosporine. Despite this evidence of association, the causal relationship remains not fully established.",NA
acute liver injury,cefdinir,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for cefdinir, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, there is evidence suggesting an association between cefdinir and acute liver injury, although this adverse reaction appears to be rare. The link is supported by post-marketing surveillance reports rather than clinical trials, as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Evidence:
   - Adult and Adolescent Patients: In the clinical trials mentioned (5093 patients treated with cefdinir capsules), the adverse events that led to discontinuation were primarily gastrointestinal, and a few cases involved rash. There was no direct mention of acute liver injury specifically in the trial patient population.
   - Pediatric Patients: The clinical trials for the oral suspension form of cefdinir (2289 pediatric patients treated) also highlighted gastrointestinal disturbances and rash as the main adverse effects, with some lab value changes noted, but again, no specific mention of acute liver injury was made in this group.

2. Laboratory Value Changes:
   - Some changes in liver-related enzymes (AST, ALT, and GGT) and bilirubin were observed, but the incidence was relatively low and not necessarily indicative of severe liver injury.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
   - After approval in Japan in 1991, and through extensive postmarketing experience, there have been reports of severe liver injuries, including acute hepatitis, cholestasis, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and jaundice. The relationship of these reports to cefdinir is not explicitly stated as causal, but the temporal association after drug use suggests a potential link.

In summary, while the evidence from clinical trials does not indicate acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction to cefdinir, the post-marketing surveillance data includes reports of serious liver injuries potentially related to the drug. However, without further context like incidence rates, patient comorbidities, concomitant medications, or detailed case reports establishing a more definitive cause-effect relationship, the evidence should be interpreted with caution. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of these potential adverse reactions and to monitor liver function as appropriate when prescribing cefdinir.","Based on the drug label sections provided, acute liver injury is not specifically identified as an adverse event in the cited clinical trials for either the cefdinir capsules or oral suspension. The adverse events listed in the U.S. trials for adult and adolescent patients, as well as pediatric patients, primarily include gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), skin reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus), and changes in various laboratory values, some of which pertain to hepatic function such as increasing transaminases (ALT, AST) at a low incidence.

Post-marketing experience does mention hepatic side effects such as acute hepatitis, cholestasis, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and jaundice. These side effects are noted as occurring during the extensive post-marketing surveillance since the drug's approval in Japan in 1991. However, it is important to recognize that post-marketing reports are less controlled and can include coincidental occurrences, and are not necessarily evidence of causation.

The fact that events of liver injury are included in the post-marketing experience but not in the more controlled clinical trial environment suggests that, if cefdinir does cause acute liver injury, such events are likely rare. Moreover, the label does not explicitly refute the relationship between cefdinir and acute liver injury; rather, it does not present conclusive evidence firmly establishing this relationship.

Still, such cases from the post-marketing experience should not be dismissed and warrant consideration when prescribing cefdinir, particularly for patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction during treatment with cefdinir and evaluate the patient's overall risk-benefit profile.

In summary, there is no concrete evidence from the clinical trials data provided that directly refutes the relationship between cefdinir and acute liver injury. Events of liver dysfunction are noted in post-marketing reports, suggesting the possibility of an association, albeit at a likely low frequency. Therefore, a definitive statement that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of cefdinir cannot be made based on the information provided."
acute liver injury,cefditoren,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cefditoren pivoxil, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury directly associated with cefditoren. However, under cephalosporin class adverse reactions, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis is listed as a known adverse reaction for this class of antibiotics, which includes cefditoren pivoxil. While cholestasis can be considered a form of liver injury, the label does not specify acute liver injury as a distinct and direct adverse event from cefditoren pivoxil administration.

The sections provided describe various adverse events thought to be related to cefditoren in clinical trials, with gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea and nausea being the most common and leading to discontinuation in some patients. Abnormal liver function tests have been observed (increased SGPT/ALT, increased SGOT/AST), which may suggest potential hepatic adverse effects. However, it is stated that it is not known if these abnormalities were directly caused by the drug or by the underlying condition being treated.

In the postmarketing experience section, there is no specific report of acute liver injury linked to cefditoren. The reported conditions do not include explicit liver injury, though conditions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis can have systemic implications and may involve liver damage among a broader spectrum of multiorgan involvement.

To conclude, while there is some evidence of hepatic dysfunction in the broader class of cephalosporin antibiotics and abnormal liver function tests have been observed in a small percentage of patients treated with cefditoren pivoxil, there is no concrete evidence in the provided sections of the drug label that directly associates acute liver injury with cefditoren pivoxil use. Clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance details specific to acute liver injury as an adverse event of cefditoren pivoxil exposure are not presented. If acute liver injury associated with cefditoren pivoxil use has been reported or studied, it would require consultation of medical literature beyond the provided drug label information.",NA
acute liver injury,cefiderocol,,"Based on the drug label excerpts provided, cefiderocol (FETROJA) has documented adverse reactions that emerged during clinical trials. Specifically, elevations in liver tests were noted as an adverse reaction in some of the treated patients, which suggests liver injury can occur as a result of FETROJA administration. This summary addresses the clinical evidence available for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction from cefiderocol exposure:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
- **cUTI Clinical Trial (Trial 1):** Among patients treated with FETROJA for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), 2% experienced elevations in liver tests (300 patients in the FETROJA group). Elevated liver tests indicate hepatic injury, which may include acute liver injury. The comparison to imipenem/cilastatin showed less than 1% experience elevated liver tests, which may suggest that the reaction is associated with FETROJA treatment. Furthermore, increased hepatic enzymes led to treatment discontinuation in 0.3% of patients receiving FETROJA.
- **HABP/VABP Clinical Trial (Trial 2):** In the trial for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), 16% of the 148 FETROJA-treated patients showed elevations in liver tests, which is indicative of possible hepatic injury. The same rate of elevated liver tests was observed in the meropenem comparator group.
  
**Post-marketing Surveillance:**
- Adverse reactions can be reported to Shionogi Inc. or the FDA. However, the drug label data provided does not include specific references to post-marketing surveillance data for acute liver injury related to cefiderocol.

**Causal Relationship Assessment:**
- The evidence from clinical trials, particularly the specified rates of elevated liver tests in cUTI and HABP/VABP patients treated with FETROJA, provides indication of a potential relationship between cefiderocol exposure and acute liver injury as an adverse event. However, comparative data with control drugs, such as meropenem, demonstrate similar rates of liver test elevations in Trial 2, which could suggest that acute liver injury may not be specific only to cefiderocol but may also be a class effect of similar drugs.

**Conclusion:**
Acute liver injury is present as an adverse reaction in a subset of patients treated with cefiderocol, as evidenced by the elevation of liver tests in clinical trial data. It is important for healthcare professionals to monitor liver function in patients receiving FETROJA and consider the risk of acute liver injury, especially in those with underlying hepatic disorders or concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Post-marketing surveillance could provide additional data to further elucidate the incidence and severity of acute liver injury with FETROJA.",NA
acute liver injury,cefpodoxime,,"The information provided from the drug label indicates that in the case of cefpodoxime, a cephalosporin antibiotic, acute liver injury has been reported as an adverse event in the post-marketing experience. It is important to note that the drug label does not mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trial settings for either the film-coated tablets or oral suspension formulations. The majority of adverse events related to cefpodoxime in clinical trials appears to be gastrointestinal in nature, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

The post-marketing experience is a phase where a broader and more diverse patient population uses the drug, potentially revealing rare or long-term side effects not detected in clinical trials. According to the drug label, acute liver injury has been documented during this phase. Although precise incidence rates and detailed characterization of these liver injury cases are not provided, this mention suggests that there is at least some evidence linking cefpodoxime exposure to acute liver injury in at least a few reported instances.

Clinical trials often involve a limited number of patients and controlled conditions, which can result in underreporting of rare adverse events like acute liver injury. Such events may become apparent only after the drug is approved and used in a larger, more diverse population.

Additionally, the labeling mentions several other serious adverse experiences reported post-marketing that are not specifically related to liver injury but indicate the potential for serious adverse reactions with cefpodoxime.

In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not prominently featured as an adverse event in clinical trials of cefpodoxime, it has been reported in the post-marketing surveillance phase. Health care providers rely on post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse reactions and make informed decisions about patient safety. It is recommended that health care professionals monitor liver function when prescribing cefpodoxime, especially for patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking other drugs known to affect the liver.

The evidence supporting the relationship between cefpodoxime exposure and acute liver injury primarily comes from post-marketing reports, which generally carry less weight than controlled clinical trial data due to potential reporting biases and the lack of systematic collection methods. Nonetheless, they are important for post-marketing drug safety surveillance.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is indeed listed as a serious adverse event observed post-marketing for cefpodoxime proxetil. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure available in the given text."
acute liver injury,cefuroxime,,"Based on the provided drug label information, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to cefuroxime can be summarized from the clinical trials experience and postmarketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
Within the data from the clinical trials, adverse reactions involving the liver were primarily limited to transient elevations in liver enzymes such as aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), each occurring in 2% of subjects (n=912) treated with cefuroxime axetil in multiple-dose clinical trials. Transient elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also noted in 1% of subjects. These findings suggest mild, reversible liver impairment as an adverse reaction but do not specifically mention acute liver injury.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
From postmarketing surveillance, hepatic impairment including hepatitis and cholestasis, and jaundice have been identified as adverse reactions. These hepatic disorders suggest a more serious level of liver injury post-drug exposure. As these reactions have been reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a strong causal relationship to drug exposure. However, the mention of these adverse reactions suggests that there is evidence of a relationship between cefuroxime exposure and potential acute liver injury.

The drug label sections provided do not mention acute liver injury explicitly in the context of clinical trials but do imply the possibility in the postmarketing experience, albeit without specific incidence rates or detailed case information. It is important to note that postmarketing reports are less controlled than clinical trials and can be influenced by various factors, including reporting biases and lack of complete patient information.

To conclusively establish a causal relationship, a more in-depth review of case studies, further controlled trials, and comprehensive post-marketing analyses would be beneficial. Additionally, healthcare providers are encouraged to report adverse reactions to regulatory agencies to help in better understanding the scope and scale of such potential drug-induced liver injuries.

**Sources of Evidence:**
1. Clinical Trials Experience - Section 6.1 of the drug label.
2. Postmarketing Experience - Section 6.2 of the drug label. 

Absence of a specific boxed warning or a section under Warnings and Precautions related to acute liver injury suggests that while there have been postmarketing reports, the evidence might not be sufficient for a stronger label warning.",NA
acute liver injury,celecoxib,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), comes from multiple sources, including pre-marketing clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and the warnings and precautions sections of the drug label.

Pre-marketing Clinical Trials:
In the clinical trials section (6.1) of the drug label, hepatic enzyme elevations were reported as an adverse event. Celecoxib was shown to cause elevations of ALT or AST (greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) in approximately 1% of patients treated in these trials, indicating some level of liver dysfunction. Additionally, notable elevations of ALT and AST occurred in approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib compared to 0.3% taking a placebo.

Post-marketing Experience:
The post-marketing experience, which includes data gathered after the drug was approved for use, provides further evidence of celecoxib's potential to cause hepatotoxicity. The drug label's postmarketing section (6.2) lists liver necrosis, hepatitis, jaundice, and hepatic failure among adverse reactions reported with celecoxib use. These findings suggest a causal relationship between celecoxib exposure and severe liver injury, although these occurrences are rare.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label section on warnings and precautions (5.3) highlights that hepatotoxicity, including rare but severe liver injuries, has been reported with celecoxib. It advises monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and discontinuing celecoxib if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing data, along with explicit warnings about hepatotoxicity in the drug label, supports a link between celecoxib use and the risk of acute liver injury. Patients should be closely monitored for liver-related adverse effects, especially those with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking other medications that can affect liver function. Clinicians should also be vigilant for signs of liver damage and advise patients of these risks when prescribing celecoxib.",NA
acute liver injury,ceritinib,,"Evidence supports the association between acute liver injury and exposure to ceritinib, which is mentioned under the ""Hepatotoxicity"" subsection in the Warnings and Precautions of the drug label provided.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
- Hepatotoxicity, including increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN), was observed in 28% and 16% respectively of 925 patients across ceritinib clinical studies.
- Cases of concurrent elevations in ALT >3 times the ULN and total bilirubin >2 times the ULN with alkaline phosphatase <2 times the ULN, which may indicate acute liver injury, occurred in 0.3% of patients across clinical studies.

Case Studies and Post-marketing Surveillance:
- The label indicates that approximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation due to hepatotoxicity, which suggests there may have been instances of severe liver injury that led to this decision.
- The ""Warnings and Precautions"" section states that liver laboratory tests should be monitored monthly, echoing the importance of monitoring for hepatotoxicity, a possible sign of acute liver injury.

Given this information, it is clear that there is a recognized risk of liver injury, including acute liver injury, associated with the use of ceritinib. The occurrence of such hepatic adverse events in clinical trial participants underlines the need for careful monitoring of liver function tests in patients prescribed ceritinib.",NA
acute liver injury,ceritinib,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ceritinib (ZYKADIA), there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of ceritinib and its exposure. Here's a summary of the relevant information concerning hepatotoxicity, which is a type of acute liver injury:

Clinical Trial Evidence:
1. In the clinical study ASCEND-4, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was observed in 28% of patients, and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than five times the ULN in 16% of patients across clinical studies with ceritinib.
2. In ASCEND-1, the rates were similar with increased ALT in 80% of patients and increased AST in 75% of the patients treated with ceritinib.
3. Additionally, concurrent elevations in ALT greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, with alkaline phosphatase less than two times the ULN occurred in about 0.3% of patients across clinical studies, indicative of drug-induced liver injury.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The labeling does not provide specific post-marketing data; however, it mentions the availability of a contact for reporting suspected adverse reactions, implying ongoing monitoring of ceritinib's safety profile post-approval.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label advises caution due to the risk of hepatotoxicity and recommends monthly monitoring of liver laboratory tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. It also states that, based on the severity of liver injury, ceritinib's use should be withheld, the dose reduced, or therapy discontinued permanently.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections contain evidence from clinical trials that demonstrates a significant incidence of increased liver enzymes indicative of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with ceritinib. This evidence is reflective of the established relationship between ceritinib exposure and the potential for acute liver injury. Monitoring liver function is recommended to manage this risk, and appropriate dose adjustments should be made in response to significant hepatotoxicity.","Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) is recognized as an adverse reaction associated with the use of ceritinib (ZYKADIA). Specifically, the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2) explicitly mentions that ceritinib can cause hepatotoxicity and provides data on liver enzyme elevations observed across clinical studies. There are no indications within the provided drug label sections that refute acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to ceritinib.

Thus, there is no available evidence to refute the relationship between acute liver injury and ceritinib drug exposure. The label itself designates hepatotoxicity as a risk and provides guidance on monitoring and managing it. Therefore, the summary response to the request for evidence refuting the relationship is ""NA."""
acute liver injury,certolizumab pegol,,"**Summary of Evidence**

**Acute liver injury** as an adverse reaction to **certolizumab pegol** (trade name **CIMZIA**) is suggested by the drug's labeling, though it does not appear to be highlighted as one of the most serious adverse reactions based on the provided sections of the label.

1. **Clinical Trials and Studies**:
   - The provided sections do not specify the frequency of acute liver injury in premarketing clinical trials for **certolizumab pegol**.
   - The ""Hepatobiliary disorders"" subsection under ""Other Adverse Reactions"" for Crohn's disease clinical trial participants lists ""elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis"" as reported conditions, which can be indicative of liver injury or inflammation but does not explicitly mention acute liver injury.
   - In placebo-controlled studies of patients with plaque psoriasis (Studies PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3), elevated liver enzymes were reported more frequently in **CIMZIA**-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects, indicating a potential risk for liver injury. Two **CIMZIA**-treated subjects were discontinued from the trial due to elevated liver enzymes.

2. **Postmarketing Surveillance**:
   - During postmarketing surveillance, ""elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis"" are mentioned but the document does not clearly distinguish acute liver injury as a specifically observed outcome.
   - Hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver and can encompass acute injury, is listed, but there is an insufficient detail to determine the precise nature and severity of liver-related adverse reactions postmarketing.

3. **Immunogenicity and Effect on Drug Concentration**:
   - The document includes information about patients developing antibodies to **certolizumab pegol**, some of which can neutralize the drug's effect, potentially leading to loss of efficacy. However, there is no direct link established between antibody formation, drug plasma concentration, and the incidence of liver injury.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the label sections provided, there is an indication that liver-related adverse events (e.g., elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis) are associated with **certolizumab pegol** use, which could suggest a relationship with acute liver injury. However, explicit evidence of acute liver injury as an isolated adverse reaction is not provided, and more detailed clinical data would be needed to fully establish this relationship.

Given the potential for liver injury, it is likely that healthcare providers monitor liver function as part of their safety evaluation when prescribing **certolizumab pegol**. Additionally, the broader context of a patient's medical history, concomitant medications, and existing liver conditions would be important factors to consider when assessing the risk of such adverse reactions.

**Sources**:
The evidence summary is based on the adverse reaction sections from the **CIMZIA** drug label provided in the query. The trial names or identifiers, detailed study results, and full peer-reviewed publications are not directly cited, hence precise references to the original research articles or clinical trial data are not included in this summary.",NA
acute liver injury,certolizumab pegol,,"The available evidence to support a relationship between acute liver injury and the use of certolizumab pegol (brand name CIMZIA) is derived from clinical trial data, post-marketing experiences, and the specific mention of hepatobiliary disorders in the adverse reactions section of the drug label.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
Clinical trials with certolizumab pegol in different patient populations (Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and plaque psoriasis) reported ""elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis"" within the safety population of controlled studies. While the data reflect experiences with the drug at varying doses, the adverse reactions section does not explicitly cite acute liver injury as a common reaction. It is important to note that ""clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions,"" which implies that rates observed in trials may not predict the rates in clinical practice.

**Hepatobiliary Disorders in Adverse Reactions Section:**
The drug label lists ""elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis"" under hepato-biliary disorders, suggesting a potential link to liver-related adverse effects, although details regarding the severity, such as acute liver injury, are not specified.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
Data from post-marketing experience, which collects information after drug approval, often from a broader and uncontrolled patient population, may include voluntary reports of adverse drug reactions. The label lists that the post-marketing experience has identified hepatobiliary disorders, including elevated liver enzymes. However, it does not provide the frequency or a definitive causal relationship to certolizumab pegol exposure, nor does it specifically mention acute liver injury.

**Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation:**
The drug label warnings and precautions section specifically mentions the reactivation of the hepatitis B virus as a risk associated with certolizumab pegol, suggesting that it can impact liver health. While this is not directly related to acute liver injury, it does imply that the drug can have serious effects on the liver.

**Limitations of Evidence:**
Despite the inclusion of liver-related adverse effects in the label, the evidence provided lacks detailed data on the incidence and characteristics of acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction to certolizumab pegol. The available information does not allow us to ascertain the prevalence or directly link certolizumab pegol to acute liver injury without further detailed analyses and reports that distinguish this specific outcome.

**Conclusion:**
In summary, while hepatobiliary disorders such as elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis are recognized in relation to certolizumab pegol use, the evidence is not sufficient to conclusively demonstrate acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction. Further investigation through case studies, clinical data analysis, and post-marketing surveillance would be required to establish such a relationship conclusively.",NA
acute liver injury,chlorambucil,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to suggest that hepatotoxicity and jaundice — which can denote acute liver injury — are potential adverse reactions to chlorambucil exposure. This is explicitly listed under the ""Miscellaneous"" section within the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" segment of the drug label.

While the label refers to hepatotoxicity and jaundice as reported adverse reactions, it does not specifically detail the incidence rates, clinical trial data, or post-marketing surveillance findings regarding the acute liver injury associated with chlorambucil. However, the inclusion in the official drug label indicates that these adverse reactions have been observed and reported sufficiently to warrant inclusion by the manufacturer and regulatory agencies.

The evidence is typically derived from a combination of clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, though in this summary, specific types of studies or statistics are not provided. Manufacturers and regulatory agencies like the FDA require reporting of adverse events that occur in the context of drug use, which are then assessed to determine causality and whether a warning should be included in the drug's labeling.

To further understand the relationship between chlorambucil and acute liver injury, it would be important to review the medical literature for case reports and clinical studies that detail the incidence, onset time, and outcome of hepatic adverse events in patients treated with chlorambucil. Clinical study reports and post-marketing surveillance data would also provide additional context on the frequency and characteristics of this adverse effect.

In summary, there is evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury and chlorambucil exposure, as acknowledged by its inclusion in the drug's label under ""Miscellaneous"" adverse reactions. However, for a more in-depth analysis, additional information from clinical studies and post-market surveillance would be required.",NA
acute liver injury,cidofovir,,"Acute liver injury is a serious health concern and is often meticulously reported in the context of drug exposure. However, following a detailed review of the provided sections from the drug label for cidofovir, there appears to be no direct mention of acute liver injury as a recognized adverse reaction from cidofovir use.

The adverse reactions highlighted in the drug label for cidofovir are extensive and include renal toxicity, neutropenia, decreased intraocular pressure/ocular hypotony, anterior uveitis/iritis, and metabolic acidosis, among others. Notably, hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatitis, hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, abnormal liver function, liver damage, liver necrosis, and cases of metabolic acidosis in association with liver dysfunction are reported. The reference to metabolic acidosis in association with liver dysfunction provides an indirect indication that cidofovir has the potential to negatively affect liver function, which might lead to liver injury.

Despite this, none of the listed adverse reactions or the serious clinical adverse events or laboratory abnormalities reported in controlled clinical studies cite acute liver injury explicitly. In the absence of explicit evidence within the provided sections of the drug label, it cannot be concluded with certainty that there is a recognized and direct relationship between cidofovir exposure and acute liver injury. Future clinical studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data may provide more insights on this potential relationship. Until then, acute liver injury is not officially documented as an adverse reaction caused by cidofovir. If cases of acute liver injury in patients taking cidofovir are encountered in clinical practice, they should be reported through the appropriate channels such as Avet Pharmaceuticals Inc. or the FDA's MedWatch program, as per the drug label instructions.","Based on the provided information from the drug label, there is no direct evidence provided to refute the relationship between acute liver injury and cidofovir exposure. However, acute liver injury is not listed as an adverse reaction within the provided sections of the drug label. While the drug label does mention hepatotoxicity-related events such as hepatitis, hepatomegaly, abnormal liver function, liver damage, liver necrosis, jaundice, and cases of metabolic acidosis in association with liver dysfunction, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction to cidofovir. Furthermore, the label indicates the need to report malignancies or serious adverse reactions to relevant authorities, which implies ongoing post-marketing surveillance that could potentially identify acute liver injury if it were a significant and causative concern.

The absence of acute liver injury in the reported clinical trial and post-marketing adverse events suggests that either there is no established evidence to demonstrate a causal relationship, or if it does occur, it is not common enough to be reported as an adverse reaction of cidofovir in the sections provided.

Therefore, while acute liver injury is not listed in the provided drug label sections as an adverse reaction of cidofovir, without further comprehensive safety data and post-marketing surveillance reports, it is difficult to conclusively refute the possibility that cidofovir could cause acute liver injury in rare cases or under specific circumstances not detailed in the provided label information."
acute liver injury,cilostazol,,"The evidence for a relationship between acute liver injury and cilostazol exposure primarily comes from post-marketing experience, as indicated in the drug's label under section 6.2. In the provided sections, acute liver injury is not specifically listed, but there is mention of 'Hepatobiliary disorders'. This includes ""hepatic dysfunction/abnormal liver function tests"" and ""jaundice"", both of which can be indicative of liver injury.

The clinical trials experience (section 6.1), based on eight placebo-controlled studies with a median treatment duration around 127 to 134 days, does not explicitly mention acute liver injury among the stated adverse reactions. Most common adverse reactions were headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools, and palpitation. Adverse events leading to discontinuation included headache and less frequently palpitation and diarrhea.

The information given regarding post-marketing experience lacks specific details about the frequency and causality of hepatic adverse events due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the unknown size of the exposed population. However, it acknowledges the existence of hepatic side effects during the usage of cilostazol outside clinical trials.

Based on the available information from the sections provided:

- Clinical trials did not report acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction to cilostazol.
- Post-marketing surveillance has revealed cases of hepatic dysfunction and jaundice, which may suggest a potential for acute liver injury, although causality and frequency are not well defined due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

It is important to consider that acute liver injury may be a rare and serious side effect, and the lack of detailed frequency in the post-marketing data does not rule out the need for clinical vigilance. In clinical practice, monitoring liver function tests is recommended in patients treated with cilostazol when symptoms suggestive of liver injury are observed.","NA

The provided drug label information does not include evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and cilostazol. Liver-related adverse reactions such as hepatic dysfunction/abnormal liver function tests and jaundice are listed under the postmarketing experience section of the cilostazol drug label, which suggests a potential relationship rather than refuting one. Therefore, appropriate evidence to refute the relationship is not available in the provided sections."
acute liver injury,cimetidine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for cimetidine, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between acute liver injury and cimetidine exposure. The ""Hepatobiliary"" section specifically reports dose-related increases in serum transaminase in some cases, which can be an indication of liver injury. Although most instances did not progress with continued therapy and returned to normal at the end of therapy, there are documented rare reports of cholestatic or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular effects. These effects were generally reversible upon discontinuation of cimetidine.

Furthermore, the label mentions a single case report of biopsy-proven periportal hepatic fibrosis in a patient receiving cimetidine tablets. Rare cases of pancreatitis, which also have implications for liver health, have been reported and cleared upon withdrawal of cimetidine.

Fatal outcomes associated with liver injury and cimetidine are described as exceedingly rare, yet there have been reports of such severe reactions. Because the information provided comes directly from the drug label, it can be inferred that this evidence likely comes from a combination of clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and case studies, although specifics on the sources are not provided in the label excerpt.

In conclusion, the relationship between acute liver injury and cimetidine exposure is supported by evidence of dose-related increases in serum transaminase, rare case reports of cholestatic or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular effects, a single case of periportal hepatic fibrosis, and extremely rare cases of fatal liver injury associated with the drug's use, as stated in the drug label. The evidence does not come from randomized controlled trials specifically designed to assess this adverse reaction but from broader clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and case studies.",NA
acute liver injury,ciprofloxacin,1.0,"The drug label for ciprofloxacin includes a warning about the potential for hepatotoxicity, indicating that instances of acute liver injury have been reported with its use. In Section 5.8 of the label, it is stated that cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis and life-threatening liver failure, have occurred with ciprofloxacin. The onset of acute liver injury is noted to be rapid (ranging from 1 to 39 days), and it can be associated with hypersensitivity. In addition to the warning, the label indicates that elevations in liver enzymes (such as ALT and AST), as well as other liver-related laboratory changes, have been observed.

It's important to note that the labeling points out that such cases of acute liver injury with ciprofloxacin are often associated with significant morbidity and mortality and typically occur in individuals over 55 years of age. The label recommends that ciprofloxacin treatment be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of hepatitis occur.

In addition to the summarized information found in the warnings and precautions section of the label, the postmarketing experience reported in Section 6.2 of the label also includes hepatic failure as an adverse reaction reported from worldwide marketing experience with the fluoroquinolone class of drugs, including ciprofloxacin.

Clinical trials reported in Section 6.1 of the label mention adverse reactions observed with the oral and parenteral administration of ciprofloxacin. During these clinical investigations, abnormal liver function tests were reported as one of the most frequently reported adverse reactions, with a frequency of 1.3%.

These findings from clinical trials, postmarketing experience, and drug label warnings provide evidence that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction of ciprofloxacin. This summary includes information sourced directly from the specified sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) of the drug label.","NA

Ciprofloxacin has been associated with hepatotoxicity, and the evidence you provided does not refute this relationship. It includes hepatotoxicity as a serious adverse reaction and provides a warning to discontinue the drug immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur."
acute liver injury,cisplatin,,"Acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction of cisplatin, according to the provided drug label sections. The ""Hepatobiliary disorders"" listed under adverse reactions from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance include elevations of aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, and bilirubin, as well as hepatic failure. These hepatic-related adverse reactions suggest potential hepatic toxicity, which can range from mild liver enzyme elevations to severe liver injury, such as hepatic failure.

While acute liver injury is not explicitly stated, the evidence of hepatic adverse reactions indicates that drug exposure to cisplatin has been associated with liver-related toxicity. Clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance typically identify these adverse reactions through the observation of changes in liver function tests and clinical symptoms, leading to their inclusion on the drug label.

Acute liver injury could manifest as severe hepatic dysfunction, including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as clinical signs of liver impairment. The mechanism by which cisplatin causes liver toxicity is not detailed in the sections provided, but the inclusion of hepatic events points toward this potential risk.

In summary, while acute liver injury itself is not specifically listed among the adverse reactions in the sections provided, indications of liver-related toxicity, such as elevations of liver enzymes and hepatic failure, are present and suggest that acute liver injury could be an adverse reaction to cisplatin. These findings would have been identified during the monitoring of patients in clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, or both. Clinicians should monitor liver function tests in patients receiving cisplatin and consider these potential reactions when observing any signs of liver injury.","NA

The available label information for cisplatin does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and cisplatin exposure; instead, it acknowledges hepatic adverse effects by listing ""elevations of aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, and bilirubin; hepatic failure"" under Hepatobiliary disorders. This indicates that liver toxicity, including acute liver injury, is a recognized adverse reaction associated with cisplatin use. Therefore, there is no evidence provided in the sections of the drug label you shared that disputes acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of cisplatin."
acute liver injury,citalopram,,"The evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and the use of citalopram is not detailed within the provided labeling sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, WARNINGS, and BOX WARNINGS). The sections provided primarily focus on the adverse reactions discussed in other parts of the label, common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, and post-marketing experience, as well as warnings and precautions relevant to the use of citalopram.

In the Postmarketing Experience section (6.2), which includes adverse reactions identified during the use of citalopram after it was approved, there is a mention of ""Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic necrosis,"" which suggests instances of severe liver injury potentially related to the use of citalopram. However, this evidence comes from voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, and the document does not clearly establish a causal relationship between citalopram and acute liver injury.

The lack of detailed information on the incidence or clinical details of these hepatic adverse reactions means there is limited evidence available in the provided sections to assert a definitive relationship between citalopram and acute liver injury. When evaluating these post-marketing reports, it is essential to consider that they may be subject to various biases, underreporting, and a lack of a control group for comparison purposes. Moreover, hepatic necrosis is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention, but the labeling does not indicate that it is a common adverse reaction.

For a more thorough evaluation, a review of the complete prescribing information, published case reports, clinical studies, and databases such as FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) would provide additional insights into the strength and specificity of the evidence regarding acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to citaloprom.

Based on the information provided, there is an indication of hepatic adverse events potentially related to citalopram use in post-marketing reports, but additional evidence would be necessary to establish a clear causal relationship between acute liver injury and citalopram exposure.",NA
acute liver injury,cladribine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct reference to acute liver injury being reported as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials or postmarketing experience for cladribine in the treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). However, under the Hepatobiliary disorders section in the Postmarketing Experience, there is a mention of ""Reversible, generally mild increases in bilirubin (uncommon) and transaminases."" These findings suggest that some liver-related effects have been observed, although they appear to be mild and reversible.

It is important to distinguish these mild liver-related effects from acute liver injury, which generally denotes a more severe form of hepatic damage. Since acute liver injury is not explicitly stated as an adverse reaction in the provided sections, either from clinical trial data or postmarketing surveillance, we cannot conclude based on this information alone that there is a reported relationship between acute liver injury and cladribine use.

In clinical practice, any potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from medications, including those that are not commonly associated with significant hepatotoxicity, would typically be identified through clinical monitoring of liver function tests and the clinical status of the patient. To fully assess the relationship between acute liver injury and the use of cladribine, one would need to look beyond the drug label, examining case reports, hepatotoxicity registries, and further research into the drug's effects on hepatic function.

In summary, there is evidence of mild, reversible increases in liver enzymes postmarketing, which could potentially be a precursor to more significant liver injury in rare cases. However, acute liver injury is not reported as a common adverse reaction of cladribine in the provided drug label sections for clinical trials or postmarketing experience. For a definitive assessment, additional sources of information should be considered.","NA

The provided label sections list various adverse reactions reported by patients treated with cladribine, including myelosuppression, infections, and neurological toxicity among others. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction within these sections. This could suggest that either acute liver injury has not been formally recognized or documented as a consistent adverse reaction to cladribine, or that it occurs at rates that are not significantly different from the baseline or control populations.

One relevant mention related to liver effects is the ""reversible, generally mild increases in bilirubin (uncommon) and transaminases"" under Postmarketing Experience, indicating a potential for liver enzyme disturbances which may not typically progress to acute liver injury.

Given the absence of specific mention of acute liver injury in the clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and warning sections of the cladribine label provided, the evidence refuting the relationship between cladribine and acute liver injury cannot be directly assessed from this excerpt. However, one might infer that if acute liver injury were frequently observed or clinically significant, it would likely be included in the label, especially under adverse reactions or warnings.

It is important to note that the absence of acute liver injury in the drug label cannot completely refute the possibility of such a reaction, since post-marketing reports and further studies could potentially reveal additional adverse effects not initially captured. For a comprehensive evaluation, one would ideally review broader pharmacovigilance data and scientific literature outside of the label information."
acute liver injury,clarithromycin,,"Evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury and clarithromycin use is outlined in sections 5.3 and 6.2 of the drug label provided.

Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):
Based on the clinical trials mentioned in the label, abnormalities in liver function tests were recorded. It is specified that elevated transaminase levels, including SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) were documented in >2% of patients in a double-blind clinical trial for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) along with other common adverse reactions (Table 5).

Hepatotoxicity (5.3):
The label warns about hepatotoxicity which includes increased liver enzymes, hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice. While the condition is usually reversible, severe cases of hepatic failure with a fatal outcome have been reported, although these cases often involved concurrent severe illnesses or other medications.

Postmarketing Experience (6.2):
In the post-marketing surveillance section, there are reports identifying acute liver failure and jaundice hepatocellular as adverse reactions potentially related to clarithromycin, though the frequency of such events and the causal relationship to the drug through spontaneous reporting is not always clear.

It is concluded from these sections that there is some evidence to suggest an association between clarithromycin exposure and acute liver injury based on the reporting of increased liver enzymes during clinical trials, documented cases of hepatotoxicity, including severe outcomes in some instances, and postmarketing reports of hepatic adverse effects. However, the data do not provide an incidence rate of acute liver injury in the general patient population taking clarithromycin, and the evidence primarily arises from clinical trials for specific indications and postmarketing voluntary reports, which could be subject to underreporting and may not be representative of broader patient experiences.

For precise data and more in-depth analysis, clinical studies with a focus on hepatotoxicity as a primary outcome would be necessary. It is also important to recognize that spontaneous reports in post-marketing surveillance cannot establish causality, but they do warrant consideration as part of a comprehensive safety profile for the medication.","NA

The drug label sections provided confirm that hepatotoxicity, which includes acute liver injury, is described as a possible adverse reaction of clarithromycin (see Warnings and Precautions 5.3). Therefore, no evidence refuting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of clarithromycin has been presented."
acute liver injury,clobazam,,"The provided drug label information for clobazam (marketed as ONFI) does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. However, it does report ""Hepatic enzyme increased"" under the section ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience."" This suggests that there have been reported instances of elevated liver enzymes, which can be an indicator of liver injury, associated with the use of clobazam.

While ""Hepatic enzyme increased"" is noted, it is stated that the reactions are reported voluntarily from uncertain size populations, and it’s not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. This implies that there is a potential signal of liver injury, but the evidence is not sufficiently robust to conclusively determine the nature of the relationship between clobazam and acute liver injury.

No specific case studies, clinical trial data, or detailed post-marketing surveillance findings are provided in the sections available that would allow a more thorough evaluation of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to clobazam.

Based on the supplied data, there is a mention of increased hepatic enzymes in the postmarketing experience, hinting at possible instances of liver injury. However, there is no detailed evidence from clinical trials or case studies in the provided sections to definitively support a relationship between clobazam use and acute liver injury. The absence of more extensive data prevents a conclusion being drawn about the causal relationship, and further investigation may be required to confirm and characterize this potential adverse event.

For healthcare providers, it is advisable to monitor liver function as part of the overall clinical management when prescribing clobazam, considering postmarketing reports that suggest potential hepatic risks. Should new evidence emerge from additional studies or more extensive post-marketing data, the evaluation of the risk of liver injury associated with clobazam may be updated.","NA

The information provided in the drug label sections for clobazam (ONFI) does not include acute liver injury as a listed adverse reaction in either clinical trial data or postmarketing experience. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence refuting or supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and clobazam exposure, given that acute liver injury is not mentioned as an observed adverse reaction."
acute liver injury,clofarabine,,"Acute liver injury is a well-documented adverse reaction associated with the use of clofarabine, a drug indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**  
- In clinical trials involving clofarabine at the recommended dose of 52 mg/m^2 daily for five days, hepatotoxicity, including severe and fatal incidents, was observed.
- Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) were noted, with Grade 3 to 4 elevations seen in 36% and 44% of patients, respectively. Elevated bilirubin, a marker of liver injury, occurred in 45% of patients, with 13% being Grade 3 or 4 (2% were Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia, one resulting in discontinuation of treatment, the other coinciding with multiorgan failure and death).
- Clinicians are advised to monitor liver function closely during clofarabine therapy and to discontinue treatment immediately if liver enzyme or bilirubin elevations reach Grade 3 or higher.

**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**  
Post-marketing reports, which collect data after a drug has been approved, have also identified severe hepatotoxicity including fatal outcomes. However, the frequency of such events cannot be reliably estimated due to spontaneous and voluntary nature of these reports.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  
- The drug's labeling includes a warning about the risk of hepatotoxicity, directing healthcare providers to monitor liver function tests and to look for signs and symptoms of hepatitis and liver failure (section 5.7 of the label).
- The possibility of severe liver damage leading to hospitalization or death is highlighted, supporting the need for vigilance in monitoring for acute liver injury during treatment.

**Boxed Warning:**  
The label lacks a specific boxed warning for clofarabine regarding acute liver injury; however, multiple sections of warnings and precautions emphasize hepatotoxicity. 

In summary, evidence from clinical trial data, documented adverse reactions, and post-marketing surveillance reports, clearly support the relationship between clofarabine use and acute liver injury. The drug label's warnings and precautions section advises careful monitoring for hepatotoxicity and immediate discontinuation of clofarabine if significant liver abnormalities are detected.",NA
acute liver injury,clopidogrel,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction and drug exposure to clopidogrel is indicated under section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) of the drug label provided. It is mentioned in the Hepatobiliary disorders subsection, where ""acute liver failure, hepatitis (noninfectious), abnormal liver function test"" are listed among adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of clopidogrel bisulfate.

This evidence comes from post-marketing surveillance, which involves reports submitted voluntarily by healthcare professionals and consumers after the drug has been approved and is available on the market. Such reports, while valuable for identifying potential adverse reactions, have limitations because they often do not permit a reliable estimation of the frequency of the reaction or a definitive establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the unknown size of the exposed population and potential reporting biases.

While the drug label does report acute liver injury as a post-market adverse reaction, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury in the detailed clinical trial summaries under the section 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience). The clinical trials cited, including CURE, COMMIT, and CAPRIE, focus on bleeding as the most commonly reported adverse reaction and do not report acute liver injury as an observed outcome.

In summary, based on the information provided:
- Clinical Trials (Section 6.1): No evidence from the clinical trials directly cited suggests that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction to clopidogrel.
- Postmarketing Surveillance (Section 6.2): Acute liver injury, which includes acute liver failure, hepatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, has been reported as an adverse reaction in the post-approval phase of drug monitoring for clopidogrel. However, the exact frequency and causality are not clearly established due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

It is important for healthcare professionals to consider these findings in the context of individual patient risk factors and clinical judgment when prescribing and monitoring the use of clopidogrel.","NA

Based on provided drug label sections, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction cannot be refuted since hepatobiliary disorders, including acute liver failure and hepatitis (noninfectious), are listed under postmarketing experience. This indicates that there have been reports of acute liver injury following the use of clopidogrel, although these are post-approval data and not necessarily established through controlled clinical trials. The causality of the drug in these reported cases cannot be established with certainty due to the nature of voluntary reporting in a postmarketing setting, but the presence of these reports prevents a conclusion that there is no relationship between clopidogrel exposure and acute liver injury."
acute liver injury,clotrimazole,,"Based on the provided information from the drug label, there is evidence suggesting a potential relationship between clotrimazole exposure and acute liver injury, as indicated by abnormal liver function tests reported in patients treated with clotrimazole troches. Specifically, elevated SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) levels, an enzyme that can indicate liver damage when present in higher amounts in the blood, were documented in approximately 15% of patients during clinical trials. 

However, the drug label information does not detail the severity of the liver injury, whether the liver function changes were transient or led to long-term issues, or if other factors may have contributed to the elevated enzyme levels. It is important to differentiate between mild, transient liver enzyme elevations that could be incidental and acute liver injury which implies a more serious condition. Additionally, the drug label mentions other non-hepatic adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, unpleasant mouth sensations, and pruritus.

Since the information pertains specifically to the use of clotrimazole troches, it may not necessarily apply to other formulations or uses of clotrimazole.

The data is derived from the clinical trials section of the drug label. However, without additional information from case studies or post-marketing surveillance, it is difficult to further characterize the relationship between clotrimazole and acute liver injury, including causality, incidence, and clinical significance.

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials indicating that clotrimazole troches may be associated with liver function test abnormalities, but the available information does not provide a comprehensive picture of the potential for acute liver injury. More detailed research and post-marketing surveillance data would be required to fully evaluate this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,clozapine,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and clozapine exposure includes information from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance that are part of the drug's safety profile as identified in the provided drug label sections.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
The labeling does not provide specific incidence rates for acute liver injury from the clinical trials of clozapine. Instead, it lists hepatotoxicity as a potential reaction under Warnings and Precautions (5.13), and references post-marketing reports.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
In post-marketing experience, cases of severe, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis, have been reported in patients treated with clozapine (see section 6.2 and 5.13). These reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is difficult to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The labeling directs clinicians to monitor for signs and symptoms of liver injury and consider discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms occur due to clozapine.

**Case Studies and Reports:**
Specific case studies or reports were not detailed in the information provided. Usually, individual case reports and case series in the scientific literature can offer insights into the clinical features, management, and outcomes of clozapine-associated liver injury.

**Summary:**
While the exact incidence of acute liver injury due to clozapine is not detailed in clinical trial data within the drug's labeling, post-marketing reports indicate that hepatotoxicity is a recognized adverse reaction. These include severe conditions such as hepatic failure, necrosis, and hepatitis. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor liver function during clozapine treatment and consider the possibility of clozapine-induced liver injury in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with liver damage. The evidence mostly comes from real-world data gathered after the approval and widespread use of the drug (post-marketing surveillance), rather than from controlled clinical trial environments. 

The information provided here is based on the drug label sections cited, which serve as the source for this summary. Additional case studies, literature reviews, and research articles in scientific journals could provide further evidence and details regarding this adverse drug reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,cobimetinib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cobimetinib (COTELLIC), evidence for the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) as an adverse reaction and drug exposure comes from clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance.

From **Clinical Trials**:
- **Trial 1**, a **randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial** for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with previously untreated patients carrying BRAF V600 mutations, included patients receiving cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib. Here, liver laboratory abnormalities leading to permanent discontinuation of cobimetinib were experienced by some patients, specifically increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.4%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (1.6%), and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (1.6%).
- **Table 4** from **Trial 1** displays the incidence of liver laboratory abnormalities, with increased AST (7%), increased ALT (6.8%), and increased GGT (6.5%) being notable Grade 3-4 adverse reactions, which indicate liver injury.
- **Trial 2**, focusing on patients with histiocytic neoplasms, presented increased AST (9%) and increased ALT (5%) as clinically significant Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities.

From **Warnings and Precautions (5.6) Hepatotoxicity**:
- The drug label advises monitoring liver laboratory tests both prior to initiation of cobimetinib and monthly during treatment.
- The incidences of Grade 3-4 liver laboratory abnormalities for patients receiving cobimetinib with vemurafenib versus vemurafenib alone were notably higher: ALT (11% vs. 5%), AST (8% vs. 2.1%), alkaline phosphatase (7% vs. 3.3%), and total bilirubin (1.6% vs. 1.2%).

**Post-Marketing Surveillance**:
- Though specific post-marketing data are not detailed in the provided sections, the labeling's adverse reactions section and instructions for reporting SUSPECTed ADVERSE REACTIONS hint at continuous surveillance and reporting mechanisms that could provide additional evidence for the relationship between the drug and liver injury.

In summary, clinical trial evidence from the provided drug label for cobimetinib indicates that hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury characterized by elevations in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), is a documented adverse reaction associated with cobimetinib exposure. This is highlighted by the drug's label under the Warnings and Precautions section, emphasizing the need for regular liver function test monitoring. Additionally, these adverse reactions appeared more frequently and severely in patients receiving the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib compared to vemurafenib alone.",NA
acute liver injury,crizotinib,,"The safety and efficacy of crizotinib (marketed as XALKORI) have been evaluated in several clinical trials, which provide evidence regarding its adverse reactions, including hepatic toxicity. Here is a summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and crizotinib exposure based on the provided sections of the drug label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
    - Hepatotoxicity (liver injury) was listed as a clinically significant adverse reaction and included under warnings and precautions (section 5.1) of the drug label.
    - The adverse reactions section (6.1) noted that hepatotoxicity, leading to fatality, occurred in 0.1% of 1719 patients with NSCLC treated across clinical trials. Concurrent increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN occurred in <1% of the cases.
    - Elevated transaminases (increased ALT or AST) were observed in 11% (ALT) and 6% (AST), with 1% of patients requiring permanent discontinuation due to elevated transaminases.
    - Across clinical trials, some patients experienced hepatotoxicity early in treatment, generally within the first 2 months.
    - In pediatric and young adult patients with various solid tumors (including ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)), elevated transaminases were noted in 71-81% of patients, with some experiencing increases >5 times the ULN.

2. Post-Marketing Experience:
    - The postmarketing experience data reported increases in blood creatine phosphokinase as an additional adverse reaction, which can be indicative of muscle injury and, in some contexts, may also reflect hepatic stress, although it's not specific to liver injury.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
    - The labeling advises monitoring liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels) periodically due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (section 5.1).
    - Recommendations are provided for withholding, reducing dose, or permanently discontinuing crizotinib in patients who exhibit signs of hepatotoxicity.

Based on data from randomized controlled trials and post-marketing surveillance as presented in the drug label, there is clear evidence to conclude that there is a risk of acute liver injury associated with crizotinib use. This is supported by observed increases in liver enzymes, some cases of hepatotoxicity leading to fatality, and the inclusion of hepatotoxicity as both an adverse reaction and as a serious warning in the drug labeling. Health care professionals are advised to closely monitor liver function and manage patients according to established guidelines detailed in the drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,crizotinib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and crizotinib exposure comes from several sources, including clinical trials, hepatic safety warnings, and postmarketing experience. Acute liver injury as an adverse effect of crizotinib is addressed in the drug label under Hepatotoxicity (section 5.1 of the Warnings and Precautions).

Clinical Trial Evidence:
Data from clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed that elevated transaminases occurred in a significant number of patients treated with crizotinib. The data provided from clinical trials also indicate that the adverse event of increased ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) more than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 11% and 6% of patients, respectively. Additionally, 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of crizotinib therapy due to elevated transaminases.

Hepatic Safety Warnings:
The Warnings and Precautions section (5.1 Hepatotoxicity) addresses serious liver-related adverse events, including fatal hepatotoxicity that has occurred in 0.1% of the 1719 patients in the clinical trials for NSCLC. Furthermore, concurrent elevations of ALT or AST ≥3 times ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 times ULN with normal alkaline phosphatase, a pattern indicative of acute liver injury, occurred in less than 1% of patients.

Pediatric Use:
In pediatric clinical trials (Study ADVL0912) which included patients with relapsed or refractory tumors, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), Transaminase elevations observed were 71% and 79% for AST and ALT, respectively, in the pediatric population (ages 1 to ≤21 years), with increases greater than five times the ULN in 6% for both AST and ALT.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
The postmarketing experience section (6.2) of the drug label notes that increased blood creatine phosphokinase has been reported as an additional adverse reaction, although the frequency or establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure is not reliably estimated due to the voluntary nature of these reports.

In summary, both clinical trial data and postmarketing experience support the relationship between crizotinib exposure and the development of acute liver injury, characterized by increased transaminases and bilirubin levels. The drug label contains explicit warnings on hepatotoxicity, advising monitoring liver function tests and recommending adjustments in crizotinib dosing or discontinuation based on the severity of hepatic adverse reactions.","NA

Clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance have documented hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction of crizotinib (XALKORI), including fatal outcomes in a small proportion of patients. Section 5.1 of the drug label explicitly states that drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 0.1% of patients across clinical trials and advises monitoring liver functions during treatment. Furthermore, concurrent elevations in ALT or AST ≥3 times the ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in less than 1% of patients. Permanent discontinuation of crizotinib was necessary in some cases due to elevated transaminases.

Therefore, based on the provided drug label sections and evidence from clinical trials, it is not accurate to refute the relationship between crizotinib and acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Liver injury is, in fact, a recognized risk of crizotinib therapy."
acute liver injury,cyclophosphamide,,"The drug label for cyclophosphamide provides various adverse reactions and warnings associated with its use. While acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in section 6.1 of the label, the post-marketing experience outlined in section 6.2 indicates hepatotoxic events, including hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, hepatomegaly, and increases in liver enzymes. These adverse reactions implicate liver injury as a possible outcome of drug exposure. 

In section 5.6, Veno-occlusive Liver Disease (VOD) is mentioned as an adverse reaction with potentially fatal outcomes. VOD is a condition where the small veins in the liver become obstructed, leading to liver damage. While VOD does not equate to acute liver injury per se, it signifies a severe liver condition possibly associated with cyclophosphamide use.

There is no clear mention of acute liver injury in the standard adverse reactions but considering the evidence of hepatotoxicity, which could range from mild liver enzyme elevations to liver failure, one could infer that acute liver injury might fall within this spectrum. Moreover, the development of hepatotoxicity suggests possible acute damage to the liver as well.

Proper assessment of the risk of acute liver injury due to cyclophosphamide would require a detailed analysis of clinical trial data and further post-marketing surveillance related specifically to liver function. In addition, case studies documenting instances of acute liver injury linked to cyclophosphamide could shed more light on the relationship. The label advises monitoring for liver function abnormalities and provides sections to report suspected adverse reactions, which underscores the importance of surveillance in detecting potential liver damage.

In conclusion, while the label does not explicitly cite acute liver injury as a common reaction to cyclophosphamide, evidence of hepatotoxicity, as well as VOD, supports the potential for liver-related adverse effects. Without additional specific clinical trial data, case reports, or a more detailed post-marketing surveillance analysis, the exact nature of the relationship between acute liver injury and cyclophosphamide cannot be fully determined. Health professionals and patients should remain vigilant for signs of liver dysfunction during cyclophosphamide therapy.",NA
acute liver injury,cyclosporine,1.0,"To summarize the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and cyclosporine exposure, the following points extracted from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience are relevant:

1. **Clinical Trials**: Hepatotoxicity, which includes adverse reactions such as cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure, was observed in clinical trials. While the percentages provided for hepatotoxicity are less than 3% in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients, the presence of these adverse reactions in controlled studies indicates a recognized association between cyclosporine use and liver injury.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: In the real-world post-marketing experience, serious cases of liver injury including hepatotoxicity with potentially fatal outcomes have been reported. Although specific incidence rates are not provided in the label, the inclusion of these observations under post-marketing surveillance suggests that these are recognized adverse effects that have occurred outside of clinical trials and have been sufficiently reported to warrant inclusion in the product's labeling.

3. **Warnings**: The drug label includes explicit warnings about the risk of systemic hypertension and nephrotoxicity with cyclosporine exposure. Hepatotoxicity is also specifically mentioned, denoting that liver injury is a critical potential adverse effect requiring caution.

Based on the evidence available in the drug label, acute liver injury is indeed a recognized potential adverse reaction associated with cyclosporine exposure. This is supported by observations collected during clinical trials and from reports obtained through post-marketing surveillance, indicating occurrences of liver injury including hepatitis and liver failure. The inclusion of hepatotoxicity in both the adverse reactions section and the warnings indicates that the risk is taken seriously by health authorities and manufacturers. However, specific incidence rates from clinical trials and post-marketing data are not detailed in the summary provided, and it would likely require a more extensive review of clinical literature and reports to determine precise frequency and risk factors associated with cyclosporine-induced liver injury.","NA

The provided drug label sections for cyclosporine, including adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, explicitly mention acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to the drug. Hepatotoxicity, including cases of cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure with serious and/or fatal outcomes, has been reported post-marketing.

Given that the relationship between acute liver injury and cyclosporine use is recognized in the label itself, there's no evidence provided that refutes this association. Therefore, the assertion that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of cyclosporine is not supported by the provided label information."
acute liver injury,cyproheptadine,,"The information you've provided from the drug label indicates that hepatobiliary adverse reactions such as cholestasis, hepatic failure, hepatitis, and hepatic function abnormality are recognized as potential adverse reactions associated with the use of cyproheptadine, which is an antihistamine medication. While ""acute liver injury"" is not explicitly listed, it can be inferred from similar terms such as hepatic failure and hepatitis, which are forms of serious liver injury.

To summarize the existing evidence:

1. **Clinical Trials:** At the time of my last update, specific clinical trial data linking cyproheptadine to acute liver injury may not be readily available in the public domain. Clinical trials for medications often assess a broad range of potential adverse effects but may not always provide granular details on each specific type of organ-specific adverse event unless it is common or a significant safety concern is identified.

2. **Case Studies:** Individual case reports and case series in the literature may describe instances where patients developed acute liver injury following the administration of cyproheptadine. These cases can provide evidence of a plausible association between the drug exposure and the adverse reaction, usually elucidated by the timing of the events and the exclusion of other potential causes of liver injury. Healthcare professionals often publish these types of reports to inform the medical community about potential rare adverse effects that may not have been fully characterized in clinical trials.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:** Post-marketing surveillance includes voluntary reports submitted to national databases like the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) in the United States or the EudraVigilance in the European Union. These systems can contain reports of adverse events observed during the commercial use of a drug. While these reports are useful for detecting signals of potential adverse reactions, they often require careful interpretation as they can include incomplete information, lack of causality assessment, and may be subject to under-reporting.

To accurately assess the evidence, one would need to conduct a thorough review of medical databases, such as PubMed, regulatory agency databases, and other pharmacovigilance resources. If reports or studies are found, they would provide the needed evidence to support the association between cyproheptadine and acute liver injury. If upon such a review, no specific evidence is found linking cyproheptadine to acute liver injury outside of the drug label information provided, this would be stated clearly. Given the nature of this response, no specific studies or reports are cited, but this approach outlines how one would verify the presence or absence of evidence for the claimed association.",NA
acute liver injury,cytarabine,,"Summary of Evidence: Relationship Between Acute Liver Injury and Cytarabine Exposure

Cytarabine, used in the treatment of various leukemias and other hematological malignancies, is known to have myelosuppression as its main toxic effect, including anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and megaloblastosis, as highlighted by the drug label. Hepatic dysfunction has been listed as a frequent adverse reaction following the administration of cytarabine. The hepatic dysfunction mentioned can range from transient enzyme elevations to acute liver injury, although liver injury is not elaborated upon in this context.

Clinical Trials:
The clinical trials sections of the label do not specify acute liver injury as an observed outcome. However, hepatic dysfunction, which potentially encompasses acute liver injury, is listed as an adverse reaction. The relationship between acute liver injury and cytarabine might be inferred from this context, though liver injury is not explicitly detailed. 

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The label does not provide information from case studies or post-marketing surveillance specifically about acute liver injury as a result of cytarabine use. However, there is mention of liver damage with increased hyperbilirubinemia under the section describing severe reactions at experimental doses. This suggests that at higher or experimental doses, there is a reported potential for liver toxicity, which might include acute liver injury.

Box Warnings:
Severe myelosuppression is the primary concern as per the boxed warning, and practitioners are advised to monitor for this effect. No specific mention of acute liver injury is included in the boxed warnings.

General Warnings:
The warnings emphasize the potential for hepatic dysfunction, instructing that therapy with cytarabine should be monitored closely, possibly implicating a risk for more severe liver injury. 

Conclusion:
While the label for cytarabine does include hepatic dysfunction as an adverse reaction of the drug, the evidence for a specific relationship between acute liver injury and cytarabine exposure is not clearly outlined in the provided labels sections. The term ""hepatic dysfunction"" could potentially include acute liver injury, but without more explicit evidence or characterization of liver injury (e.g., elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, liver failure), the link remains somewhat indirect.

There may be more detailed reports or case studies on this specific adverse event in the broader literature; for a conclusive assessment, a thorough review of published case reports, clinical trials, and post-marketing data beyond the label information would be necessary. If there are reports of acute liver injury post-marketing or in published material, they were not provided in the sections of the label presented here.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label, the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings section lists various potential side effects from the administration of cytarabine, including bone marrow suppression, infections, gastrointestinal complications, and hepatic dysfunction. However, ""acute liver injury"" is not explicitly mentioned among the adverse reactions. It is important to note that ""hepatic dysfunction"" is listed, which could potentially encompass a range of liver issues, including acute liver injury. However, without explicit evidence or studies specifically refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and cytarabine usage in these sections, it is not possible to provide a summary that definitively refutes this adverse reaction. Hence, the 'NA' response indicates that the available labeling information does not provide clear evidence to refute the claim that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of cytarabine, but caution should be exercised given the mention of hepatic dysfunction, which may indirectly include acute liver injury as a potential adverse effect."
acute liver injury,dactinomycin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to dactinomycin (also known as Cosmegen) can be derived from various sections of the drug's labeling, which include mentions of hepatotoxicity and hepatic adverse reactions. 

1. Hepatotoxicity Warning (Section 5.8):
- The drug label explicitly lists hepatotoxicity as a possible adverse reaction, indicating that there is an established risk of liver toxicity associated with dactinomycin administration. Monitoring of liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) is recommended before and during treatment to detect potential hepatotoxicity.

2. Hepatobiliary Adverse Reactions (Adverse Reactions Section):
- Within the Adverse Reactions section of the label, liver-related adverse reactions such as liver function test abnormalities, hepatomegaly, hepatitis, and hepatic failure with reports of death are noted, suggesting a direct association between liver injury and the drug.

3. Veno-occlusive Disease (Section 5.2):
- Severe and potentially fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) has been observed in patients treated with dactinomycin, particularly in younger patients and those who have received concomitant radiotherapy. The condition is characterized by liver damage and can manifest through elevated liver enzymes, weight gain, hepatomegaly, and ascites, signifying a severe form of liver injury.

While these sections do not describe the frequency of occurrences or detailed clinical trial data specific to acute liver injury, postmarketing reports and observations during clinical use provide evidence that such reactions can occur. It is crucial to note that because some adverse reactions are gathered from voluntary reports, it is difficult to reliably estimate their exact frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure solely based on these reports.

Overall, the drug label's inclusion of hepatotoxicity, including liver function test abnormalities and hepatic failure, plus warnings about severe liver diseases such as VOD, supports the evidence of a relationship between acute liver injury and dactinomycin exposure. Healthcare professionals should monitor liver function during dactinomycin therapy and manage patients accordingly.",NA
acute liver injury,dalbavancin,,"Based on the drug label sections provided:

### Acute Liver Injury and Dalbavancin:

**Evidence from Clinical Trials:**
- The drug label mentions hepatic effects under both the ""Warnings and Precautions"" and the ""Adverse Reactions"" sections.
- The label notes that, in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, there were instances where patients with normal baseline ALT levels exhibited elevations to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) upon treatment with DALVANCE, with some cases experiencing ALT values greater than 10 times ULN.
- Fifteen of the seventeen DALVANCE-treated patients with significant ALT elevations had pre-existing conditions that might affect liver enzymes, including chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and metabolic syndrome, which could suggest other contributing factors to liver enzyme elevations.
 
**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
- There is no specific mention of acute liver injury following dalbavancin exposure in the post-marketing experience section of the label. However, post-marketing surveillance is a critical tool for identifying adverse reactions that may not have been apparent during clinical trials due to the larger and more diverse population exposed to the drug after its approval.

**Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions:**
- While acute liver injury itself is not specifically mentioned, the gist from the label is that alterations in liver tests (e.g., ALT, AST, bilirubin) can occur. Therefore the hepatic effects warning acknowledges that liver enzyme elevations are a known issue but does not fully qualify the spectrum of liver injury that may arise.

**Case Studies:**
- The provided sections of the dalbavancin drug label do not include data from specific case studies that could offer additional detailed insight into instances of acute liver injury.

### Summary:

The evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and dalbavancin exposure primarily comes from clinical trial data indicating that a small percentage of patients experienced significant elevations in ALT levels, which is an indicator of potential liver injury. Some of these patients had underlying conditions which could also contribute to liver enzyme changes. There are no detailed case studies or specific data from post-marketing surveillance directly connecting acute liver injury to dalbavancin in the provided label sections. 

While there is evidence that dalbavancin can affect liver enzyme levels, the relationship to acute liver injury remains characterized by the presence of elevated liver enzymes in clinical trials, the potential pre-existing conditions of patients, and the inherent limitations of post-marketing surveillance in establishing causal relationships. The drug label's warnings suggest that liver effects should be watched for, implying that patients on dalbavancin may be at risk for liver-related adverse effects, including acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,dalbavancin,,"Based on the provided drug label information for dalbavancin, there is evidence suggesting a potential relationship between dalbavancin exposure and hepatic effects, including acute liver injury. The evidence is summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**

- In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with dalbavancin with normal baseline transaminase levels experienced post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) compared to those treated with non-dalbavancin comparators (0.8% vs. 0.2%).
- Among dalbavancin-treated patients with elevated ALT, some patients had post-baseline ALT values greater than 10 times ULN, and one subject from a Phase 1 trial had ALT elevations greater than 20 times ULN. The label notes that these elevations were reversible with follow-up assessments.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**

- Although no specific cases of acute liver injury are mentioned in the post-marketing experience, adverse reactions are reported through this surveillance method. However, due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports and the uncertainty of the size of the reporting population, it is difficult to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure for any particular adverse effect.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

- The label includes a specific warning about hepatic effects (5.3), stating more subjects treated with dalbavancin experienced ALT elevations than comparator-treated subjects in clinical trials.
- The label advises monitoring liver tests such as ALT, AST, and bilirubin, suggesting recognition of the potential for hepatic effects including liver injury.
  
It is important to note that the liver injury adverse events appeared to be reversible in the subjects followed up in clinical trials.

In summary, the evidence outlined in the drug label suggests an association between dalbavancin exposure and the potential for hepatic effects, including acute liver injury, as characterized by increased ALT levels. This evidence is supported by data from clinical trials and is further acknowledged in the warnings and precautions section of the label. However, the exact frequency of acute liver injury and the establishment of a causal relationship may be limited by the availability and nature of post-marketing data. It is recommended to monitor patients receiving dalbavancin for signs of liver dysfunction.","NA

The label information provided contains a section on hepatic effects (5.3), which mentions that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations were reported more frequently in DALVANCE-treated subjects with normal baseline transaminase levels compared to comparator-treated subjects. Additionally, it notes that abnormalities in liver tests (including ALT, AST, bilirubin) were reported with similar frequency in both the DALVANCE and comparator arms. This suggests that while there is evidence of hepatic enzyme elevations, this is not specifically characterized as acute liver injury within the provided sections of the drug label. There is no clear evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and dalbavancin exposure directly stated in the information provided. Therefore, the statement ""NA"" is used to indicate that the evidence to refute the relationship is not available within the context of the text provided."
acute liver injury,danazol,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and danazol exposure can be derived from the adverse reactions and warnings stated in the drug label, clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance data.

Adverse Reactions Listed on the Drug Label: 
The drug label for danazol explicitly states that hepatic dysfunction, which is evidenced by reversible elevated serum enzymes and/or jaundice, has been reported in patients receiving a daily dosage of 400 mg or more of danazol. It acknowledges the seriousness of hepatic toxicity that has been associated with the drug, including conditions like cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular injury, and even hepatic failure. Though the label specifies that these reports have come from observations in clinical practice, it is stated that the patients should be monitored for hepatic dysfunction through laboratory tests and clinical observation, which indicates a recognized risk of liver injury with danazol use.

Clinical Trials: 
Detailed summary results from clinical trial data specific to danazol and acute liver injury would be needed to provide exact figures and incidences; however, the drug label indicates hepatic dysfunction as a noted adverse event which suggests clinical trial observation of this reaction.

Case Studies: 
The drug label references the reporting of serious hepatic toxicity, which is usually documented in clinical literature in the form of case reports or case series. Cases of hepatic dysfunction and liver injury related to danazol use that provide direct evidence can be found in medical and scientific literature databases such as PubMed, but the specific details are not provided within the label.

Post-Marketing Surveillance: 
Post-marketing reports are mentioned in the drug label, indicating that observations of serious hepatic toxicity have occurred outside of controlled clinical trials, probably reported through pharmacovigilance activities and databases such as the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). These reports enhance the evidence from clinical trials and case studies, confirming an association between danazol and liver injury.

Warnings: 
In the warnings section, the label cautions against the use of long-term danazol due to observed cases of peliosis hepatis and benign hepatic adenoma, which may present silently and suddenly become life-threatening through intraabdominal hemorrhage. This recommendation to use the lowest possible dose and make periodic attempts to decrease or withdraw therapy indicates the potentially severe nature of liver injury associated with danazol.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and danazol exposure is outlined in the drug label through reported adverse reactions and warnings based on clinical observations, trials, case studies, and post-markarketing surveillance. While specific clinical trial data and individual case reports are not provided in the label, the mention of these outcomes and the provided guidance for monitoring and caution signify recognition of this serious risk associated with danazol therapy.","NA

The adverse reactions section of the danazol drug label explicitly states that hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by reversible elevated serum enzymes and/or jaundice, has been reported in patients receiving a daily dosage of 400 mg or more. It further lists serious hepatic toxicity, including cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular injury, and hepatic failure as observed reactions. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and danazol exposure; the association is established and acknowledged in the drug labeling information."
acute liver injury,daptomycin,,"The provided drug label sections relevant to daptomycin (marketed as Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection) do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction identified in the clinical trials or postmarketing experience. Here is a concise summary of the evidence, based on the information provided, regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and daptomycin exposure:

**Clinical Trials Evidence**: Clinical trials involving daptomycin included 1,864 adult patients treated with the drug and 1,416 patients treated with comparators. The summary of adverse reactions from these trials mentions ""abnormal liver function tests"" in 3.0% of adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) treated with daptomycin at a dose of 4 mg/kg. Additionally, a non-specific mention of ""jaundice"" is listed among drug-related adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of patients in cSSSI trials. In the section discussing laboratory changes, there is a reference to ""increased serum lactate dehydrogenase"" and ""liver function test abnormal"" as possibly or probably drug-related in the daptomycin-treated group. These findings suggest that liver abnormalities may be associated with daptomycin, but there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction.

**Postmarketing Experience**: The summary of the postmarketing experience reveals various adverse reactions reported with Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection, but acute liver injury is not specified. It states that various blood and lymphatic system disorders, immune system disorders, and infections have been reported. Though not detailed, it is conceivable that liver-related adverse effects could emerge within a broader scope of clinical use. Reports of adverse drug reactions during the postmarketing phase often lack the detailed tracking and assessment found in clinical trials.

In summary, there is some evidence from clinical trials suggesting that daptomycin can be associated with liver function test abnormalities, but there is no clear, direct evidence linking acute liver with daptomycin exposure based on the provided sections of the drug label. Further evaluation of the complete clinical study reports and postmarketing data might be necessary to fully assess this potential relationship. If more information is available regarding acute liver injury outside of the provided label sections or from independent studies and case reports, it would be important to include such evidence in a thorough evaluation. Without such data, we cannot conclusively state that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction of daptomycin based solely on the provided sections of the drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,darunavir,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and darunavir exposure is based on clinical trial data, reports of hepatic adverse events, and post-marketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to hepatobiliary disorders, including acute hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, hepatotoxicity), were reported in less than 2% of antiretroviral treatment-naïve subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily during the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C211.

In antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adult subjects, liver function test abnormalities were observed. The Phase 3 trial TMC114-C214 reported Grade 2 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in subjects treated with darunavir/ritonavir, indicating potential liver injury.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The drug label indicates hepatotoxicity as a possible adverse reaction and advises monitoring liver function prior to and during therapy, particularly in patients with underlying hepatic diseases or pre-treatment elevations in transaminases. Hepatitis has been reported in 0.5% of patients in the clinical development program of darunavir/ritonavir, suggesting an association with liver injury.

Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including fatalities, have been reported with darunavir/ritonavir use. These reports, however, do not establish a causal relationship due to the multifactorial nature of liver injury in the context of advanced HIV disease, concomitant medications, and comorbid conditions such as hepatitis B or C co-infection.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
The postmarketing experience section mentions cases of drug-induced hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes, but exact incidence rates and the establishment of a causal relationship to darunavir exposure are not provided.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggests a potential association between darunavir exposure and acute liver injury. This relationship is supported by observed hepatic enzyme elevations and reports of hepatitis in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients during clinical trials, as well as post-marketing reports of liver injury. Nonetheless, considering the complex clinical situations of the patients involved, a definitive causal link cannot be firmly established based on the available evidence. The drug label recommends monitoring liver function and considering the possibility of liver injury when symptoms indicative of hepatic dysfunction appear.",NA
acute liver injury,dasatinib,,"There is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and dasatinib (marketed as SPRYCEL) administration. The evidence is drawn from clinical trials experience, postmarketing experience, and labeled warnings.

### Clinical Trials Experience
As documented in the adverse reactions (section 6.1) of the drug label, hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials with dasatinib. It is mentioned in the Warnings and Precautions (section 5.11) that SPRYCEL may cause hepatotoxicity, measured by elevations in liver-related enzymes and bilirubin. Grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin were reported in patients across all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML.

### Postmarketing Experience
Postmarketing reports (section 6.2) have identified hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction during the post-approval use of SPRYCEL. Because postmarketing reports involve voluntary reporting and an uncertain size population, their frequency is harder to estimate, but they are nonetheless a significant source of safety information following wider exposure to the drug in the general population.

### Warnings and Precautions
The drug label (section 5.11) directly addresses hepatotoxicity as a potential issue and recommends assessing liver function before initiation of treatment and monthly or as clinically indicated thereafter. The suggestion to monitor liver function demonstrates the recognized risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury.

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance supporting the relationship between dasatinib use and the potential for acute liver injury. The drug label itself contains specific warnings about hepatotoxicity and recommendations for monitoring, which underlines the established risk. It is important to continually evaluate the liver function of patients on dasatinib to detect any signs of adverse hepatic reactions and manage them accordingly.",NA
acute liver injury,decitabine,,"The drug label provided for decitabine, a medication used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), describes various adverse reactions experienced by patients during clinical trials. Regarding the specific relationship between decitabine exposure and acute liver injury, the evidence can be extracted from the adverse reactions and investigations sections of the label.

Within the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1), hepatobiliary disorders such as hyperbilirubinemia were noted. This condition indicates an elevated level of bilirubin in the blood, which can be a marker of liver injury. Hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 12 out of 83 patients (14%) treated with decitabine in a controlled MDS trial. Additionally, increases in blood alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase were observed, which are enzymes that can be elevated due to liver damage or dysfunction. 

Furthermore, the adverse reactions that resulted in clinical intervention or dose modification in the controlled supportive care study include increased blood bilirubin and abnormal liver function tests. These observations are indicative of liver issues that warranted interventions such as dose delays, reductions, or discontinuation of the drug.

In the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), there is no specific listing of acute liver injury; however, adverse reactions are reported voluntarily and may not capture all instances or establish a causal relationship due to the variable size and diversity of the exposed population.

While there is no explicit mention of ""acute liver injury,"" evidence within both the clinical trials and the adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention suggest that liver-related toxicities, including markers of potential liver injury like hyperbilirubinemia, increased liver enzymes, and abnormal liver function tests, were associated with decitabine treatment. This information implies a potential relationship between decitabine exposure and adverse liver effects, which could include acute liver injury.

Physicians prescribing decitabine should be aware of these potential liver-related adverse effects and monitor their patients accordingly, as described in the myelosuppression warning (Section 5.1), although patients with known liver dysfunction were not studied in the MDS trials.",NA
acute liver injury,deferasirox,,"Based on the provided drug label information for deferasirox, there is evidence to support that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction related to the drug’s use. Evidence from clinical trial experience and post-marketing surveillance indicates instances of hepatic toxicity, including acute liver injury and failure.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
- Clinical trials involving deferasirox reported incidences where patients experienced elevations in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, which can be indicative of liver injury. 
- In Study 1, 17 patients treated with deferasirox showed elevations in SGPT/ALT levels greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at two consecutive visits. Of these, two patients had liver biopsy-proven drug-induced hepatitis and both discontinued deferasirox therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 
- Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation included abnormal liver function tests and drug-induced hepatitis.

**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
- There have been spontaneous reports of hepatic failure during postapproval use of deferasirox. Although individual cases cannot always establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary nature of these reports, they suggest a possible association with deferasirox use.

The drug label for deferasirox also explicitly lists Hepatic Toxicity and Failure as a risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], indicating a recognized occurrence of these adverse reactions in patients using the medication. Patients are recommended to undergo liver function monitoring before and during treatment with deferasirox. 

These findings from clinical trial data and post-marketing reports, as well as the explicit warnings in the labeling, substantiate the relationship between deferasirox use and the risk of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. The occurrence of this adverse reaction in the clinical trial population, as well as the reports after market release of the drug, supports the need for careful monitoring of liver function in patients taking deferasirox.",NA
acute liver injury,delafloxacin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for delafloxacin (BAXDELA), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction. However, under the “Most Common Adverse Reactions” in the clinical trial experience for both acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), transaminase elevations were noted in 3% of patients treated for ABSSSI and 5% of patients treated for CABP.

Transaminase elevations indicate that there could be damage to liver cells, as transaminases (enzymes such as ALT and AST) are released into the bloodstream when liver cells are injured. Therefore, while direct evidence of acute liver injury is not specified, the documented transaminase elevations could suggest a potential for delafloxacin to cause liver cell damage in some individuals, which may manifest as acute liver injury in more severe cases.

The clinical trials referenced in the label involved a total of 1170 patients treated with BAXDELA across all Phase 3 trials. The details are as follows:

- ABSSSI Trials: Adverse reactions were evaluated for 741 patients treated with BAXDELA and 751 patients treated with comparator drugs. Transaminase elevations occurred in 3% of those in the BAXDELA arm.
  
- CABP Trial: Adverse reactions were evaluated for 429 patients treated with BAXDELA and 427 treated with moxifloxacin, with transaminase elevations occurring in 5% of the BAXDELA-treated patients.

The data from clinical trials, although not mentioning acute liver injury per se, do include instances of transaminase elevations, which is considered pertinent evidence for potential adverse effects on the liver.

In addition, under “Adverse Rections Occurring in Less Than 2% of Patients Receiving BAXDELA,” there is mention of hepatic enzyme increased, which again points to the liver being affected in some cases.

No explicit evidence from case studies or post-marketing surveillance is provided in the drug label sections. To fully ascertain the relationship between delafloxacin and acute liver injury, further data from post-marketing surveillance, case reports, and additional studies would be needed.

In conclusion, while the provided drug label sections do not report acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction to delafloxacin, there is evidence of transaminase elevations in clinical trial subjects treated with the drug. These elevations imply a potential risk for liver-related adverse effects, which may, in more severe cases, present as acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,demeclocycline,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, evidence supports the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of demeclocycline. Demeclocycline is a member of the tetracycline class of antibiotics, and the label specifically mentions that ""hepatic toxicity"" and ""increases in liver enzymes"" have been rarely reported as adverse reactions. Furthermore, the label acknowledges rare occurrences of hepatitis and liver failure associated with the drug, and states that these reactions have been observed with both oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines, which includes demeclocycline.

Although detailed data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance are not explicitly provided in the drug label summary, it is standard practice for such information to be included based on the analysis of recorded adverse events during those phases. The mentioning of these liver-related adverse reactions in the drug label indicates that there is evidence from some combination of clinical trials, case studies, post-marketing surveillance, or a postulated mechanism of drug action that has established a connection between demeclocycline usage and acute liver injury.

To summarize, while specific sources such as individual clinical trial results or case studies are not given, the drug label itself serves as an authoritative source that indicates that there is evidence to support the relationship between demeclocycline exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, albeit reported as a rare occurrence. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of these possible reactions and to monitor liver function when prescribing this medication. Additionally, patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of liver injury, so they can report them promptly if they occur.",NA
acute liver injury,desflurane,,"The provided drug label sections for SUPRANE (desflurane) describe various adverse reactions and safety concerns associated with its use. Regarding the specific inquiry about acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of desflurane, the following evidence and information are outlined:

1. Post-Marketing Experience (Section 6.2):
   - Hepatobiliary Disorders: The listed post-approval adverse reactions, reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, include hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal, and liver disorder. However, due to the nature of spontaneous reporting, the frequency of these events is not reliably estimated, and a causal relationship to drug exposure is not established.

2. Hepatobiliary Disorders (Section 5.5):
   - It is mentioned that with the use of halogenated anesthetics, reactions indicating a disruption of hepatic function, icterus, and fatal liver necrosis have been reported. These reactions may indicate hypersensitivity; in particular, desflurane may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients who have been previously sensitized by exposure to other halogenated anesthetics.
   - Patients with pre-existing liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or viral hepatitis, may require the selection of an alternate anesthetic.
   - Caution is advised when considering repeated anesthesia with any halogenated anesthetic within a short time frame.

Based on the information from the sections of the drug label you provided, there are reports of hepatic disorders associated with the use of desflurane in the post-marketing experience, although the incidence is not quantifiable due to voluntary reporting. Additionally, the hepatobiliary disorders section clarifies that sensitivity hepatitis could be a risk in certain patients, mainly those sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics, which suggests a relationship between desflurane and hepatic adverse reactions.

To conclusively establish a causal relationship between acute liver injury and desflurane exposure, further studies, including controlled clinical trials and robust post-marketing surveillance data, would be needed. While such detailed evidence is not provided in the drug label excerpts, these sections do indicate that there is some awareness of potential hepatic adverse reactions associated with desflurane usage. For a more definitive assessment, research articles, case studies, registry data, and comprehensive reviews of clinical cases would be required.",NA
acute liver injury,desloratadine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and desloratadine exposure is referenced in Section 6.2 of the provided drug label focusing on post-marketing experience. Based on this information, acute liver injury manifests as hepatitis and is associated with elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin. These findings have emerged during the post-marketing surveillance period, an observational phase where adverse events are voluntarily reported by healthcare professionals and consumers after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use. It is important to note that such post-marketing data is subject to underreporting and does not always provide enough information to reliably estimate the frequency of the adverse event or to establish a definite causal relationship to drug exposure.

In the clinical trials (Section 6.1), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury or hepatitis as an observed adverse event in the patients who received desloratadine. Clinical trials conducted had a wide range of doses and included both pediatric and adult populations, with no serious adverse events or withdrawals related to liver injury reported in patients taking the recommended daily dose of 5 mg.

The lack of detailed statistics or case reports in this summary of the drug label prevents a thorough evaluation of the incidence rate or the strength of the association between desloratadine and acute liver injury. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that while acute liver injury is not commonly associated with desloratadine based on clinical trial data, there have been post-marketing reports that suggest such a potential adverse reaction. Clinicians should consider this risk when prescribing desloratadine and should monitor their patients for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction. Patients are also advised to report any adverse reactions to their healthcare provider or to the FDA MedWatch program to contribute to the surveillance of medication safety.",NA
acute liver injury,desvenlafaxine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance for desvenlafaxine. However, there is a note in the section describing other adverse reactions observed in premarketing and postmarketing clinical studies that mentions ""liver function test abnormal"" as an infrequent occurrence (<2% incidence) in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients treated with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. This suggests there have been some indications of liver-related issues, but it does not specifically refer to acute liver injury.

In the sections provided, lipid elevations are mentioned under laboratory changes observed in clinical studies, but these do not specifically point to hepatic injury. Additionally, cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported, which indicates a need for regular monitoring of patients for this adverse effect. However, elevated blood pressure is not typically associated with acute liver injury.

No box warnings, contraindications, or other warnings and precautions specifically refer to hepatic adverse events such as acute liver injury. For a thorough assessment of the evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and desvenlafaxine, information from published case reports, specific clinical trials examining hepatic outcomes, pharmacovigilance databases, and post-marketing reports would need to be evaluated.

In summary, based on the label information provided, there is a mention of abnormal liver function tests, but no clear evidence in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data supporting a direct relationship between desvenlafaxine and acute liver injury. If acute liver injury has been associated with desvenlafaxine, it appears to be infrequent or not definitively linked based on the available labeled information. For conclusive evidence, further research and data from additional sources are required.",NA
acute liver injury,desvenlafaxine,,"Evaluation of the evidence for a relationship between desvenlafaxine (PRISTIQ) exposure and acute liver injury is not straightforward based on the provided label sections, as there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury in the listed adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, or warnings. 

From the adverse reactions (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) and warnings sections of the label:
- Common adverse reactions in clinical studies (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) include: nausea, dizziness, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, constipation, somnolence, decreased appetite, anxiety, and certain sexual function disorders (6.1).
- Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation included: nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting (6.1).
- Infrequent adverse reactions observed (incidence of <2%) included: liver function test abnormal (6.1).
- Post-marketing surveillance identified adverse reactions without a reliable estimate of their frequency, but acute liver injury was not explicitly mentioned (6.2).

In the clinical trials, while there was a mention of ""liver function test abnormal,"" the label does not provide sufficient details to establish a causal relationship specifically to acute liver injury. The lack of explicit mention in both the sections on post-marketing surveillance and other adverse reactions further complicates the establishment of a clear relationship.

The evidence for a relationship between acute liver injury and desvenlafaxine exposure is limited based on the information from the label provided. This summary lacks reports from specific case studies or more detailed clinical trial data that directly associates acute liver injury with desvenlafaxine. Additionally, comprehensive post-marketing data or large-scale observational studies that could provide more insights into such a relationship are not provided.

To arrive at a conclusive statement regarding the association of desvenlafaxine with acute liver injury, further information would be required, including detailed examination of cases with abnormal liver function tests observed during clinical trials, case reports, and analyses from post-marketing surveillance that clarify the context and frequency of acute liver injury following desvenlafaxine administration.",NA
acute liver injury,dexlansoprazole,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and dexlansoprazole exposure is not explicitly provided in the provided label sections. The label does include information on various adverse reactions and safety concerns associated with dexlansoprazole but does not directly mention acute liver injury as an observed adverse reaction. Here is a summary of the relevant sections related to hepatobiliary disorders, which may encompass liver injury, based on the provided label sections:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - In the safety evaluation of dexlansoprazole in 4,548 adult patients, hepatobiliary disorders are listed among less common adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of less than 2%. Specifically mentioned are biliary colic, cholelithiasis (gallstones), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver).
   - The clinical trials did not report acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction associated with dexlansoprazole.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Hepatobiliary disorders that have been identified during postapproval use of dexlansoprazole include drug-induced hepatitis, which is liver injury due to drug exposure.
   - However, because postmarketing reports are voluntarily submitted and the population size is uncertain, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a definitive causal relationship to dexlansoprazole.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   - There is no specific warning or precaution relating to liver injury or hepatitis on the provided sections of the label.
   
4. Hepatobiliary Disorders Section:
   - Among the less common adverse reactions, those related to the liver (drug-induced hepatitis) are mentioned under the Postmarketing Experience section.

In conclusion, while drug-induced hepatitis is reported in the postmarketing experience, there is no clear evidence provided in the label sections that directly establishes a relationship between acute liver injury and dexlansoprazole exposure. Therefore, it is possible that such cases are rare or not reported at significant rates in clinical trials. If concerns about liver injury arise, health care providers may consider liver function tests to monitor patients taking dexlansoprazole or any potential signs of hepatotoxicity. Additionally, the overall benefit-risk profile should be considered when prescribing this medication.",NA
acute liver injury,diazepam,,"The evidence reviewed from the provided drug label sections does not directly connect diazepam exposure to acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. The label mentions that among Laboratories findings, elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase have been reported, which can be indicative of liver injury. However, these elevations may or may not signify clinically significant acute liver injury and are not explicitly identified as such.

Additionally, there is mention of 'isolated reports of jaundice,' which implies that there have been some incidences where liver-related issues have occurred, but there is no indication of the frequency or consistency of this event relative to diazepam exposure. Jaundice can be a sign of liver dysfunction, potentially related to acute liver injury, but without systematic evidence from clinical trials or a clear pattern from post-marketing surveillance, it is difficult to establish a causative relationship.

Furthermore, the label provides no data from clinical trials specifically about acute liver injury. It is important to note that adverse reactions such as jaundice and elevated liver enzymes could be underreported or occur as a result of confounding factors like concomitant medication use, pre-existing liver conditions, or the patient's overall health status.

To fully ascertain the relationship between diazepam and acute liver injury, it would be necessary to review additional sources like published clinical trial data, case studies, and detailed post-marketing surveillance reports beyond the summary presented in the drug label. This would allow for a better assessment of causality. In the absence of substantial and consistent data supporting a direct link, it would be inappropriate to conclusively state that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction to diazepam. 

For healthcare professionals and patients, it is advisable to monitor liver function during long-term therapy with diazepam as a precautionary measure and to report any suspected adverse events to the appropriate channels, such as the FDA MedWatch program. Further investigation and vigilance would be needed to clarify whether cases of liver injury are indeed related to diapezam use and to understand the underlying mechanisms, should a relationship exist.","NA

The information provided from the drug label for diazepam does not include acute liver injury as a reported adverse reaction. While there are mentions of elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase in the context of laboratories, as well as isolated reports of jaundice which could suggest liver dysfunction, these do not establish a causal link to acute liver injury specifically. There is no direct evidence or specific mention refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and diazepam exposure presented here, nor are there any clear statements indicating that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction of diazepam.

In order to refute a relationship between acute liver injury and diazepam exposure, one would need to present data from studies or large-scale surveillance explicitly showing a lack of association. Without such evidence, the conclusion here is not that there is evidence refuting the relationship, but rather that acute liver injury is not listed among the recognized adverse reactions in the sections provided."
acute liver injury,diclofenac,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and diclofenac exposure can be inferred from the drug label sections provided, particularly under ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" and ""WARNINGS.""

Clinical Trials Experience:
According to the drug label, during clinical trials, elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, and jaundice were reported as adverse experiences associated with the use of diclofenac sodium. These indications point toward potential liver injury in patients consuming the drug. However, the label does not provide specific prevalence rates of acute liver injury or detail the circumstances under which liver injury emerged during the clinical trials, such as dose-response or duration of exposure.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label also notes adverse reactions reported occasionally, which include serious liver-related events such as fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, liver failure, and liver necrosis. These observations are likely based on post-marketing surveillance data, which encompass reports from a broader patient population after drug approval, providing real-world evidence of the drug's adverse effects.

Warnings:
The ""WARNINGS"" section highlights hepatotoxicity as a significant concern and underscores the risk of liver damage associated with diclofenac use, reinforcing the notion that acute liver injury is an adverse effect of the drug.

No box warnings pertaining specifically to liver injury are stated within the provided sections, suggesting that while liver injury is a recognized adverse effect, it may not be considered frequent or predictable enough to warrant the highest level of warning issued by the FDA.

In summary, the evidence from the clinical trials experience and post-marketing surveillance supports the relationship between acute liver injury and diclofenac exposure. Liver-related adverse reactions such as hepatitis, jaundice, and even severe conditions like liver failure and liver necrosis are documented, suggesting that diclofenac can cause acute liver injury. For precise rates and a more robust evaluation, one would need to look at the detailed clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance reports.

Please note that the above summarization does not replace a comprehensive search and review of the scientific literature, which may provide additional insights and contextual information on the relationship between acute liver injury and diclofenac.","NA

The drug label sections provided explicitly list hepatotoxicity as one of the adverse reactions to diclofenac and other NSAIDs, and acute liver injury is a well-known form of hepatotoxicity. Given that the request was to provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and diclofenac, but the available label information confirms it as a known adverse reaction, there is no evidence available within the provided material to refute this relationship."
acute liver injury,dicloxacillin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to dicloxacillin among penicillinase-resistant penicillins. While the label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury with dicloxacillin use, it does include hepatic reactions as potential adverse effects. Specifically:

1. Hepatotoxicity characterized by fever, nausea, and vomiting in conjunction with abnormal liver function tests, such as elevated AST (SGOT) levels, has been associated with other penicillinase-resistant penicillins like oxacillin and cloxacillin.

2. Cholestatic hepatitis, which is a form of liver injury, has been rarely reported. This indicates that liver damage, although infrequent, is a recognized adverse reaction within this class of antibiotics.

3. The label also acknowledges asymptomatic and transient increases in liver enzyme concentrations, such as alkaline phosphatase, AST (SGOT), and ALT (SGPT), which could be indicative of liver stress or injury.

Since dicloxacillin is a member of the same class of antibiotics as oxacillin and cloxacillin, and given the hepatotoxicity associated with this class, it is possible that dicloxacillin could share a similar adverse reaction profile concerning liver injury. However, the absence of explicit evidence directly linking dicloxacillin to acute liver injury in the provided sections means one cannot definitively conclude that such a relationship exists solely based on the label information. It should also be noted that adverse reactions can vary among different drugs within the same class.

Additional evidence such as observational studies, clinical trials, or more in-depth post-marketing surveillance data would be needed to ascertain a clear causal relationship between dicloxacillin and acute liver injury. If more detailed evidence outside of the drug label is required, it could typically be sought in medical literature databases, adverse event reporting systems, or regulatory agency databases.",NA
acute liver injury,didanosine,1.0,"Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury and Didanosine Exposure:

Clinical Trials:
The provided drug label for didanosine mentions hepatomegaly with steatosis and lactic acidosis as observed adverse reactions in the boxed warnings, under the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2). The label also denotes hepatic toxicity and specifies that interruption/discontinuation must be considered upon the worsening of liver disease (5.3). However, it does not specify acute liver injury per se in the detailed adverse reactions section from the clinical trials (6.1). Lab abnormalities, such as increased SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT), which can be indicators of liver injury, were observed in clinical trials as shown in Table 4, but these don't directly translate to clinically significant acute liver injury.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
In the postmarketing experience (6.2), hepatobiliary disorders like hepatitis and liver failure are listed as identified adverse reactions. While acute liver injury is not stated explicitly, hepatitis and liver failure can be considered severe forms of acute liver injury, supporting a relationship between the drug and potential liver damage.

Additional Relevant Information:
There are multiple warnings about pancreatitis, which can sometimes be related to liver complications, however, since pancreatitis is a distinct condition, it is not directly relevant to acute liver injury evidence. Similarly, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis mentioned in the warnings may contribute to or coexist with acute liver injury but represent broader terms for liver abnormalities.

Conclusion:
The evidence from postmarketing surveillance substantiates the relationship between didanosine exposure and hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatitis and liver failure, which can be associated with acute liver injury. Evidence from clinical trials predominantly pertains to laboratory indicators of liver dysfunction but falls short of explicitly documenting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Caution should be exercised when prescribing didanosine to patients with preexisting liver conditions or those with risk factors for liver dysfunction.",NA
acute liver injury,dimethyl fumarate,,"Evidence Supporting the Relationship Between Acute Liver Injury and Dimethyl Fumarate Exposure:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
Clinical trials have noted the occurrence of elevated hepatic transaminases (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate. During the first six months of treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, there was an increased incidence of these liver enzyme elevations, mostly < 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and balanced between the dimethyl fumarate and placebo groups. No elevations in transaminases ≥ 3 times the ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times the ULN were observed in controlled trials. Discontinuation due to elevated hepatic transaminases was similar for both dimethyl fumarate treated patients (< 1%) and placebo.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
In the post-marketing experience, clinically significant cases of liver injury, including liver function abnormalities and elevations in transaminases (≥ 3 times ULN) with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin (> 2 times ULN), have been reported with dimethyl fumarate use. These events varied in onset, ranging from a few days to several months after the initiation of the treatment. Some of these reported cases required hospitalization, but no instances of liver failure, liver transplant, or death associated with liver injury and dimethyl fumarate were reported.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label for dimethyl fumarate advises obtaining serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels before initiating treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter. Liver injury is listed as a warning and precaution, and the label recommends discontinuing dimethyl fumarate if clinically significant liver injury induced by the drug is suspected.

Summary:
There is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that supports a relationship between exposure to dimethyl fumarate and the risk of acute liver injury. This evidence includes observed increases in liver enzyme levels during clinical trials and reports of clinically significant liver injury in the post-marketing setting. Consequently, the drug label for dimethyl fumarate includes warnings about the potential for liver injury and provides guidance for monitoring liver function.",NA
acute liver injury,dimethyl fumarate,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and dimethyl fumarate (brand name Tecfidera) consists of data from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trials Experience**:
According to the drug label information provided, during controlled clinical trials, there was an observed increase in the incidence of elevated hepatic transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate, particularly within the first six months of treatment. However, most transaminase elevations were less than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and the frequency of elevations was similar between the dimethyl fumarate and placebo groups. There were no reported elevations of transaminases to more than three times the ULN with concurrent elevations in total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, which is a known predictor of serious liver injury. Discontinuations due to elevated hepatic transaminases were less than 1% and were similar in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate or placebo.

**Postmarketing Experience**:
In the post-approval setting, there have been reported cases of liver injury in patients taking dimethyl fumarate, including elevated hepatic transaminases and bilirubin levels. These laboratory abnormalities have ranged from mild to significant elevations, with some cases necessitating hospitalization. The liver injury onset varied from a few days to several months after initiation of the drug. Notably, all reported cases of liver injury resolved following discontinuation of dimethyl fumarate, and none resulted in liver failure, liver transplant, or death.

**Liver Injury Warning**:
The drug label includes a specific warning (5.5 Liver Injury) regarding clinically significant cases of liver injury that have been reported postmarketing. Patients are advised to obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels before beginning treatment and during treatment as clinically indicated. Clinicians are instructed to discontinue dimethyl fumarate if they suspect clinically significant liver injury induced by the drug.

In summary, the evidence demonstrates an association between dimethyl fumarate and elevations in hepatic transaminases observed in clinical trials and reports of clinically significant liver injury in the postmarketing experience. This data suggests that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction to dimethyl fumarate, and monitoring liver function is recommended in patients receiving this medication.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for dimethyl fumarate (TECFIDERA), evidence refuting a direct relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure is not explicitly detailed. The drug label mentions liver injury as an adverse reaction to be aware of and to monitor (section 5.5). It states that while clinically significant liver injury has been reported in the postmarketing setting, signs and symptoms of liver injury, including elevated serum aminotransferases and total bilirubin, resolved upon discontinuation of the drug. It is noted that none of the reported cases of liver injury resulted in liver failure, liver transplant, or death.

Furthermore, section 6.1 of the label indicates that while there was an increased incidence of elevations in hepatic transaminases in patients treated with TECFIDERA during clinical trials, most of these elevations were less than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Importantly, there were no instances of transaminase elevations greater than or equal to 3 times the ULN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin levels over 2 times the ULN, which would be more indicative of severe liver injury.

Thus, while there is a recognition of liver injury as a potential adverse reaction, with monitoring recommended, there is no conclusive evidence presented in these sections directly refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and dimethyl fumarate exposure. Postmarketing surveillance and clinical trial data indicate that any elevations in liver enzymes were typically mild to moderate and resolved with discontinuation of the drug.

Given the absence of data specifically refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and dimethyl fumarate in the provided drug label sections, the evidence to explicitly refute such a relationship is not available in the presented text. Clinical judgment, based on comprehensive assessment and monitoring of individual patient cases, remains essential for detecting and managing potential liver injury related to dimethyl fumarate usage."
acute liver injury,diroximel fumarate,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and diroximel fumarate (known by the brand name VUMERITY), which shares the same active metabolite as dimethyl fumarate, can be distilled from the drug label sections provided, primarily from clinical trial data and post-marketing experiences.

**Clinical Trials Experience with Dimethyl Fumarate:**
Clinical trials have observed elevated hepatic transaminases (liver enzymes) in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate, especially within the first six months of treatment. These elevations were generally less than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), with similar discontinuation rates due to elevated hepatic transaminases in both treatment and placebo groups (<1%). While significant liver injury, such as elevations in transaminases ≥3 times the ULN with concurrent elevations in total bilirubin >2 times the ULN, was not observed during these trials, it is a noted point of vigilance in the clinical context.

**Postmarketing Experience with Dimethyl Fumarate:**
In the postmarketing phase, clinically significant liver injury has been reported with the use of dimethyl fumarate. The liver injury presented as elevated aminotransferases greater than five-fold ULN and bilirubin levels greater than two-fold ULN, resolving upon discontinuation of treatment. Some cases required hospitalization. The onset of liver injury ranged from a few days to several months after initiation of treatment, highlighting a causal link between drug exposure and liver injury.

**Drug Label Warnings and Precautions:**
The drug label explicitly lists liver injury as a condition to monitor for both before and during treatment with diroximel fumarate. It advises obtaining measures of serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin prior to commencement of the drug and monitoring during treatment as clinically indicated. The instructions are to discontinue the medication if there is suspicion of clinically significant liver injury induced by diroximel fumarate. This serves as a scientifically grounded recommendation based on both the clinical trial observations and postmarketing reports associated with dimethyl fumarate, which shares the same pharmacologically active metabolite.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between acute liver injury and diroximel fumarate exposure is supported by evidence from clinical trial observations and postmarketing reports related to dimethyl fumarate. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended to promptly identify and manage potential liver injury in patients under treatment with diroximel fumarate. The exact incidence rate of acute liver injury specifically due to diroximel fumarate is not clearly stated, but the shared pharmacologic profile with dimethyl fumarate suggests caution is warranted and provides a directly relevant clinical foundation for monitoring and intervention strategies.",NA
acute liver injury,disopyramide,,"The provided drug label information does not specifically mention acute liver injury as a reported adverse reaction to disopyramide phosphate. However, there is mention of less than 1% of patients experiencing elevated liver enzymes, which could be an indicator of hepatocellular injury or dysfunction. There is no explicit linkage provided between disopyramide phosphate and instances of acute liver injury within the extracted label sections. Mention of reversible cholestatic jaundice is made, indicating that liver-related issues, although they may be reversible and infrequently occurring, have been observed.

The label includes a variety of adverse reactions that were reported during clinical trials involving 1,500 patients with disopyramide. These adverse reactions range from frequent anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth and urinary hesitancy, to cardiovascular issues like hypotension and congestive heart failure. The document also includes a general warning of hypoglycemia and infrequent occurrences of reactions such as reversible cholestatic jaundice and fever, which are relevant to hepatic function.

Cholestatic jaundice, directly mentioned in less than 1% of patients, can be associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). While the label does not discuss acute liver injury in depth, it should be noted that cholestatic jaundice can be a manifestation of liver dysfunction or injury, albeit the causality with disopyramide is not characterized as direct within the information provided.

To evaluate the relationship between acute liver injury and disopyramide exposure further, additional data sources such as peer-reviewed clinical study publications, post-marketing surveillance reports, and case studies would need to be reviewed. Such evidence could present more detailed insight into the incidence, severity, and mechanisms of potential liver injury related to disopyramide usage.

In summary, based on the drug label alone, there is insufficient evidence to establish a direct relationship between acute liver injury and disopyramide exposure. There is, however, a small percentage of patients who experienced elevated liver enzymes and reversible cholestatic jaundice, which suggests that liver-related adverse reactions are possible, although apparently rare. For a comprehensive safety assessment, additional data sources should be considered.","NA

The drug label information provided does not include acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of disopyramide; therefore, there is no evidence presented here to refute a relationship between acute liver injury and disopyramide exposure. However, it should be noted that the label does mention the occurrence of reversible cholestatic jaundice and elevated liver enzymes in less than 1% of patients, which could be indicative of hepatic issues, although acute liver injury specifically is not mentioned. If detailed investigations and post-marketing surveillance data are not available or provided, it cannot be conclusively stated that there is no relationship. In such cases, it would be important to consult the wider medical literature, including case reports, database reviews, and post-market surveillance data for any evidence of an association between acute liver injury and disopyramide use."
acute liver injury,disulfiram,1.0,"The evidence for a potential relationship between acute liver injury and disulfiram exposure can be summarized based on the information provided from drug labeling, which likely reflects data from clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance:

1. **Clinical Trials**: The labeling doesn't specifically mention data from clinical trials regarding acute liver injury. It is common for labels to reference such reactions if they were observed during clinical trials.

2. **Case Studies**: The label notes that ""Multiple cases of hepatitis, including both cholestatic and fulminant hepatitis, as well as hepatic failure resulting in transplantation or death, have been reported with administration of disulfiram."" These cases manifest as case study reports in the literature, indicating that there is evidence correlating disulfiram use with severe liver injury.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: The inclusion of liver injury in the labeling suggests that post-marketing reports of acute liver injury related to disulfiram have been significant enough to warrant inclusion. Post-marketing surveillance data are essential for identifying adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials due to their larger and more varied patient population.

The presence of this information in the label's ""Adverse Reactions"" section is a direct indication that the relationship between acute liver injury and disulfiram has been observed and reported. Health professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities (for instance, the FDA's MedWatch program in the U.S.), suggesting ongoing monitoring of this potential adverse effect.

However, detailed data from clinical trials or the number of post-marketing reports that led to the inclusion of liver injury warnings is not provided here. The label does emphasize the severity of the liver injury cases, pointing to them being significant enough to contribute to transplantation or death, which indicates a clinically relevant concern.

In conclusion, the labeling for disulfiram states there have been multiple reported cases of severe liver injury, including hepatitis of various types, associated with its administration. These cases, documented through post-marketing reports and possibly case studies, provide the evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to disulfiram. While specific data from clinical trials or the exact number of post-marketing incidents is not detailed in the provided summary, the inclusion of such warnings in the label indicates that healthcare professionals should exercise caution and monitor for liver-related adverse reactions during disulfiram treatment.","NA

The provided drug label sections clearly describe acute liver injury, including hepatitis, cholestatic and fulminant hepatitis, as well as hepatic failure resulting in transplantation or death, as reported adverse reactions associated with the administration of disulfiram. Given that evidence of a potential adverse reaction is acknowledged in the label, there is no refuting evidence to summarize regarding the non-relationship between acute liver injury and disulfiram."
acute liver injury,docetaxel,,"The drug label for docetaxel provides substantial information indicating that hepatic impairment, including liver injury, can occur with docetaxel use:

1. **Toxic Deaths and Hepatic Impairment Warning**: The label contains a boxed warning that states treatment-related mortality increases with abnormal liver function. Specifically, the warning advises against the use of docetaxel if bilirubin levels are higher than the upper limit of normal (ULN), or if the AST and/or ALT are greater than 1.5 times the ULN in conjunction with an alkaline phosphatase level greater than 2.5 times the ULN. This information explicitly links poor liver function to increased risk when using docetaxel, consistent with acute liver injury concerns.

2. **Hepatic Reactions**: The label reports that in patients with normal liver function tests at baseline, elevated bilirubin and significant elevations in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatize were observed during treatment with docetaxel. It is noted, however, that the correspondence of these changes to the drug or underlying disease is not firmly established.

3. **Dose Modification for Abnormal Liver Function**: The drug label indicates that patients with elevated liver enzymes should not receive docetaxel, and dose modifications should be considered for patients with isolated elevations of transaminase levels. Bilirubin, AST or ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels are supposed to be measured before each treatment cycle, demonstrating the acknowledged risk of hepatic adverse effects and the need for caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

In addition to the information provided in the drug label, the development of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to docetaxel can also be derived from:

- **Clinical Trials Experience**: The adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, including changes in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, suggest that liver function may be impacted by docetaxel. Hematologic and other toxicity is reported to increase with higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests.

- **Postmarketing Experience**: Liver-related adverse reactions, including hepatitis, sometimes fatal, primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been identified during postmarketing surveillance. While this evidence is less controlled than clinical trial data, it offers real-world insights into the potential risks associated with docetaxel use.

In summary, evidence for a relationship between acute liver injury and docetaxel exposure is present in the form of warnings about toxic deaths associated with hepatic impairment, reported hepatic reactions including changes in liver enzymes, required monitoring of liver function, and postmarketing experiences of liver-related reactions. This evidence comes from the drug label itself, which is the result of comprehensive clinical trials and ongoing surveillance. Therefore, the relationship between docetaxel and the potential for acute liver injury, while not characterized as a common adverse event, is recognized and associated with dose adjustments, contraindications, and warnings within the drug's prescribing information.",NA
acute liver injury,dofetilide,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, there is no direct evidence within clinical trials indicating that dofetilide causes acute liver injury. The clinical program involving approximately 8,600 patients does not report acute liver injury as a frequent adverse reaction. Instead, it identifies other side effects as common, such as headache, chest pain, dizziness, respiratory tract infection, dyspnea, and nausea, among others. While there is mention of ""liver damage"" as an adverse event reported with a frequency of less than or equal to 2% in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, this adverse event does not specify acute liver injury and is not further elaborated upon in terms of causality or the nature of the liver damage.

In terms of liver-related laboratory test abnormalities, the label states, ""No clinically relevant effects were noted in serum alkaline phosphatase, serum GGT, LDH, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, total protein,"" indicating no significant hepatic effects were observed in the clinical trials of dofetilide.

Given this information from the drug label, there is no strong evidence from clinical trials to suggest a relationship between dofetilide exposure and acute liver injury. Post-marketing surveillance details are not mentioned, nor are there any specific case studies provided that might support such a relationship.

For the most precise and updated information, further investigation into post-marketing surveillance reports, case studies, and medical literature might be necessary to conclusively determine if there is a relationship between acute liver injury and dofetilide. If recent case reports or surveillance data indicate such an association, that information was not included within the scope of the provided drug label sections.

To report a suspected adverse reaction related to dofetilide, the label directs individuals to contact AvKARE, Inc., or the FDA's MedWatch program, which indicates a system for ongoing monitoring of adverse events. However, based on the given information, there is no clear evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and dofetilide.",NA
acute liver injury,dolutegravir,,"Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to dolutegravir is mentioned in the drug labeling for TIVICAY, the branded formulation of dolutegravir. Below is a summary of the available evidence from the provided sections of the label:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- The clinical trials for dolutegravir did not specifically list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in treatment-naïve subjects (Section 6.1).
- Treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced subjects had some adverse events related to the liver, such as elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST), but acute liver injury was not explicitly reported in the summarized data (Sections 6.1, Table 6).

Postmarketing Experience:
- The postmarketing experience, which captures adverse events reported once the drug is used in the broader population, has identified cases of acute liver failure and hepatotoxicity in patients taking dolutegravir (Section 6.2). This data suggests a relationship between dolutegravir and liver injury, including severe cases.

Warnings and Precautions:
- Hepatotoxicity, a broader term that could include acute liver injury, has been reported in patients receiving dolutegravir. The label notes that hepatotoxicity could be more pronounced in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C and recommends monitoring for this condition (Section 5.2).

Based on this information, it can be concluded that while acute liver injury was not a highlighted adverse reaction in clinical trials, there is post-marketing evidence that supports its occurrence in patients taking dolutegravir. It is recommended to monitor patients receiving dolutegravir for signs of hepatotoxicity. Keep in mind that the post-marketing surveillance data cannot establish a causal relationship with certainty due to the spontaneous and voluntary nature of reporting, and the lack of control groups for comparison. However, the inclusion of acute liver failure and hepatotoxicity in the drug label post-marketing experience section suggests that health professionals should be aware of this potential risk.",NA
acute liver injury,dolutegravir,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and dolutegravir exposure can be found within the provided drug label information under several sections. It is important to note that the relationship between drug exposure and adverse reactions such as acute liver injury typically involves an integration of data from clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and other studies. Here is a concise summary based on the provided sections:

1. **Warnings and Precautions (5.2):** The label indicates that hepatotoxicity, which encompasses a range of liver injuries including acute liver failure, has been reported in patients receiving dolutegravir-containing regimens. It specifically mentions that patients with underlying hepatitis B or C are at increased risk for transaminase elevations, a marker of liver injury. In some cases, liver injury was consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation, especially when anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. There is also a mention of drug-induced liver injury leading to liver transplant reported with TRIUMEQ, which includes dolutegravir as one of its components.

2. **Postmarketing Experience (6.2):** Postmarketing reports have identified adverse reactions such as acute liver failure and hepatotoxicity in patients on dolutegravir. The voluntary nature of these reports means the exact frequency of such events cannot be reliably estimated, but they nonetheless contribute to the body of evidence associating dolutegravir with potential liver injury.

3. **Adverse Reactions (6.1):** Within the Hepatobiliary Disorders subtitle, hepatitis is listed as an adverse event. Though it occurred in less than 2% of subjects, it's included because of its seriousness and the assessed potential causal relationship.

4. **Clinical Trials Experience:** From the data provided, hepatotoxicity concerns were acknowledged, particularly in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Elevations in liver enzymes (ALT/AST), which are indicative of liver injury, were observed at higher rates in this subgroup.

5. **Table 6 (Selected Laboratory Abnormalities, Grades 2 to 4):** Some patients in the SPRING-2 and SINGLE trials experienced ALT and AST elevations - markers of liver function - that reached levels of concern (Grades 2 to 4). Although these tables show a minority of patients affected, they demonstrate evidence of hepatotoxicity.

6. **Laboratory Abnormalities:** It also mentions Grade 3 to 4 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities, including elevated ALT and AST, in patients in the VIKING-3 trial.

While the data show an association between dolutegravir and liver injury, it is important to recognize that post-marketing surveillance and clinical trial experiences are subject to limitations in establishing causal relationships. These can include underreporting, lack of control groups, and confounding factors. Therefore, while there is evidence to suggest a relationship between dolutegravir exposure and acute liver injury, further studies would be beneficial to understand the incidence, mechanism, and risk factors for this adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,donepezil,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and donepezil exposure is not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections. Acute liver injury is not mentioned among the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials (section 6.1) or in the list of conditions described under warnings and precautions (section 5). Furthermore, acute liver injury is not listed as a side effect in the post-marketing experience section (6.2), which includes other hepatobiliary conditions like hepatitis.

In the post-marketing experience (section 6.2), hepatitis is mentioned as a voluntarily reported adverse reaction but without information on the frequency or establishing a clear causal relationship to donepezil exposure. Hepatitis can encompass a variety of liver injuries, which may range from mild to severe, but this does not directly denote acute liver injury.

Therefore, based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no direct evidence presented that links donepezil exposure to acute liver injury. For healthcare professionals and patients, this lack of evidence suggests that, while there are hepatobiliary adverse events reported like hepatitis, donepezil is not commonly associated with acute liver injury in the data derived from clinical trials, spontaneous reporting, or within known warnings and precautions for the drug. To fully ascertain the drug's safety profile regarding liver injury, accessing the full scientific literature, additional pharmacovigilance data, and more substantial epidemiological studies would be necessary.","NA

Acute liver injury is not listed as an adverse reaction in the provided drug label sections for donepezil. The sections provided detail a variety of potential adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, and genitourinary conditions, as well as specific common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, but acute liver injury is not mentioned among them. Therefore, based on the information from the drug label, there is no evidence to suggest that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction of donepezil. However, this does not establish definitive proof that donepezil cannot cause acute liver injury, as postmarketing reports and future studies may reveal additional information not currently listed in the label. It is also important to note that postmarketing surveillance data mention hepatitis but do not provide enough detail to establish a causal relationship or to definitively refute the possibility of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. It is critical for patients to report any suspected adverse reactions to their healthcare provider and for providers to report these events to regulatory agencies, which helps to continually update drug safety profiles."
acute liver injury,dotatate,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for dotatate (Lutathera), evidence concerning acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the drug can be summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In clinical trials, including NETTER-1 and another study involving ERASMUS data, hepatotoxicity was monitored as a potential adverse reaction. The occurrence of significant liver-related adverse reactions was notably low. However, liver function test abnormalities such as increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were observed.
- In NETTER-1, the incidence of Grade 3-4 (severe) elevations of GGT was 20%, AST was 5%, and ALT was 4% among patients receiving Lutathera (N=111) compared to those receiving high-dose long-acting octreotide.
- In ERASMUS, less than 1% of patients were reported to have hepatic tumor hemorrhage, edema, or necrosis, with one patient experiencing intrahepatic congestion and cholestasis.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
Adverse reactions identified in the post-marketing setting are reported voluntarily, and therefore, it is difficult to assess their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure. The label specifically mentions hepatotoxicity (which can include acute liver injury) and advises monitoring liver function.

In conclusion, the provided sections of the drug label indicate that hepatotoxicity is a recognized risk of dotatate, with abnormalities in liver enzymes observed in clinical trial patients, and potential for severe liver-related adverse reactions noted in the post-market setting. The evidence suggests that while acute liver injury might not be the most common adverse reaction, it is a potential risk factor and healthcare providers are advised to monitor liver function in patients treated with Lutathera. Monitoring transaminases, bilirubin, serum albumin, and the international normalized ratio (INR) is recommended during treatment, and adjustments to the dosing of Lutathera may be necessary based on the severity of hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,doxazosin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for doxazosin, acute liver injury is mentioned under ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" as ""hepatitis cholestatic,"" which can be an indication of liver injury associated with drug exposure.

Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
Clinical trials conducted with doxazosin in patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension did not report acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. In BPH patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions more than 1% higher than placebo included dizziness, somnolence, hypotension, and others. In hypertensive patients, similarly, dizziness, somnolence, rhinitis, polyuria, and fatigue were more commonly reported than placebo but did not include liver injury.

Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
In the postmarketing phase, where adverse reactions are voluntarily reported by patients, hepatitis cholestatic was identified as an adverse reaction. Cholestatic hepatitis is a form of liver injury characterized by impaired bile flow and can present as acute liver injury. While the exact frequency of this adverse reaction is uncertain due to voluntary reporting, it establishes a potential link between doxazosin and liver injury post-drug exposure.

Warnings and Precautions (Section 5):
The sections of warnings and precautions did not specifically mention acute liver injury as a concern with the administration of doxazosin.

Conclusion:
While the clinical trial data (Section 6.1) for doxazosin does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, there is evidence from postmarketing surveillance (Section 6.2) indicating that acute liver injury, manifesting as hepatitis cholestatic, has been reported after doxazosin was approved for use. It should be noted that postmarketing reports do not always provide conclusive evidence of a causal relationship due to the voluntary and often anecdotal nature of these reports. However, they do suggest a potential association that may warrant further investigation or close monitoring in patients using doxazosin.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction associated with doxazosin. The label details various other adverse reactions and warnings from clinical trial experience and postmarketing experience, but acute liver injury is not listed among them. Thus, there appears to be no evidence within the provided sections of the label that refutes or supports the relationship between acute liver injury and doxazosin exposure. To make a definitive statement about the absence of this relationship, further investigation into broader medical literature, clinical trial data, and postmarketing surveillance reports beyond the label would be required."
acute liver injury,doxycycline,,"Acute liver injury is a type of hepatotoxicity which is a rare adverse reaction to doxycycline. The evidence for the association between doxycycline exposure and acute liver injury primarily comes from post-marketing surveillance, as liver injury has been reported infrequently in the context of tetracycline use, including doxycycline.

**Clinical Trials**: Clinical trials with doxycycline have not commonly reported acute liver injury as a side effect. Most side effects observed in clinical trials have been related to the gastrointestinal system, as mentioned in the drug label.

**Case Studies**: Case reports and case series in medical literature occasionally document instances of drug-induced liver injury associated with doxycycline use. These reports are important because they provide detailed clinical data on individual cases, allowing for an assessment of possible causality. However, they are not sufficient to establish a definitive link, and incidence rates cannot be derived from case studies alone.

**Post-marketing Surveillance**: Hepatotoxicity has been reported ""rarely"" as per the adverse reactions section of the drug label, indicating that instances of liver injury have emerged in the post-marketing experience. This implies that acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of doxycycline has been observed outside of clinical trials, but the frequency is low. Such cases may not have been anticipated during clinical trials, or they occurred at rates below the detection limits of these studies.

While the specific mechanism by which doxycycline might cause acute liver injury is not fully understood, it is important to consider that drug-induced liver injury is an idiosyncratic reaction, meaning that it is unpredictable and might not be dose-related.

Healthcare providers generally rely on these sources of evidence to evaluate the potential risks of drug use. When prescribing doxycycline, they should consider the rare possibility of acute liver injury and monitor patients for symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, nausea, or right upper quadrant pain, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for hepatotoxicity.

**Summary**: Acute liver injury has been reported as a rare adverse reaction to doxycycline, primarily based on post-marketing surveillance data. Clinical trials have not frequently reported this adverse reaction, and while case studies provide individual instances of this occurrence, they cannot establish causality or frequency. The drug label indicates the hepatotoxicity has been observed with tetracyclines and, therefore, patients should be monitored for signs that may indicate liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,dronedarone,,"Evidence supports the relationship between acute liver injury and dronedarone (Multaq) exposure primarily through postmarketing experience, as indicated by the drug label sections provided. The relevant sections summarize findings from clinical trials and postmarketing reports, as follows:

1. Clinical Trials (Section 6.1):
The safety of dronedarone was evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) across five placebo-controlled studies including ATHENA, EURIDIS, ADONIS, ERATO, and DAFNE. Among 3282 patients treated with dronedarone, there were 11.8% who prematurely discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 7.7% in the placebo group. However, the most common reasons for discontinuation were gastrointestinal disorders and QT prolongation. There is no explicit mention of liver injury or hepatotoxicity within these trial results. Therefore, these clinical trials do not provide direct evidence of acute liver injury related to dronedarone usage.

2. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
The postmarketing experience, which collects voluntary reports from a larger and less controlled population, identified liver injury as an adverse reaction in patients treated with dronedarone. The incidence and establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure are not definitive due to the nature of voluntary reporting and unknown sample size. However, the inclusion in the labeling implies recognition of a potential relationship.

3. Liver Injury Warning (Section 5.5):
The drug label explicitly warns of hepatocellular liver injury associated with dronedarone, including severe cases that require liver transplantation. Patients are advised to be vigilant for symptoms of hepatic injury and healthcare providers are recommended to monitor liver function periodically, especially within the first 6 months of treatment. This warning, based on postmarketing reports, signifies that there is evidence of a link between dronedarone and liver injury, even though specific rates and comparative data are not provided.

In summary, while clinical trials did not explicitly report acute liver injury as a finding, postmarketing surveillance has provided evidence that this adverse reaction can occur in patients exposed to dronedarone. Consequently, the drug label includes strong warnings and precautions regarding liver injury, indicating recognition of this risk by health authorities based on the evidence obtained from patient use after the drug's approval.",NA
acute liver injury,dronedarone,,"Evidence suggests that dronedarone, an antiarrhythmic medication marketed under the name MULTAQ, has been associated with adverse hepatic effects including acute liver injury. This evidence includes clinical trial observations and postmarketing reports.

From the clinical trials perspective, the safety evaluation of dronedarone is based on data from five placebo-controlled studies (ATHENA, EURIDIS, ADONIS, ERATO, and DAFNE) involving a total of 6,285 patients. The most common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal and general conditions such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and asthenia. Although hepatotoxicity was not highlighted as a common adverse reaction in these studies, these controlled environments provide extensive data monitoring and are typically not as comprehensive in detecting rare adverse events as postmarketing surveillance.

The postmarketing experience is especially pertinent in understanding the relationship between acute liver injury and dronedarone use. Post-approval surveillance of MULTAQ has identified cases of liver injury, including severe hepatocellular liver injury and acute liver failure requiring transplant. Due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reporting, it is challenging to establish the frequency of these adverse reactions or prove a causal relationship between drug exposure and liver injury. Nonetheless, since the drug label explicitly warns about liver injury and requires monitoring for symptoms suggesting hepatic injury, this is a recognized concern.

Moreover, the drug’s labeling advises immediate discontinuation of MULTAQ if hepatic injury is suspected, supported by evidence of hepatotoxicity that has occurred in patients treated with dronedarone, highlighting serious liver-related adverse effects.

In conclusion, the relationship between acute liver injury and dronedarone exposure is substantiated by postmarketing case reports and explicit warnings in the drug label. However, these adverse hepatic effects do not seem to be commonly reported in controlled clinical trials, which suggests that they may be rare or detected only after longer-term use or in broader patient populations. It is essential for healthcare providers to monitor for signs of liver injury in patients taking dronedarone and for patients to be aware of the symptoms associated with hepatic adverse reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,duloxetine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury has been identified as a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of duloxetine—an antidepressant and nerve pain medication. Here’s the available evidence summarizing the relationship between duloxetine and acute liver injury:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:**

   Clinical trials have provided evidence of liver function test abnormalities. Among patients treated with duloxetine, there have been reports of hepatic failure, some fatal. These cases have manifested as hepatitis with various symptoms such as abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevation of transaminase levels substantially above the upper limit of normal. The medication should be discontinued in patients who develop jaundice or other signs of significant liver dysfunction.

2. **Postmarketing Experience:**

   Postmarketing surveillance has detected instances of severe liver injury, including fatalities, temporally associated with the use of duloxetine. These reports serve as real-world evidence complementing the controlled environment of clinical trials and indicate that there is a risk of hepatic failure associated with duloxetine use.

3. **Warnings and Precautions:**

   The drug label specifically warns about the risk of hepatotoxicity with duloxetine use. The recommendation is to avoid prescribing duloxetine to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease. Liver function tests show that duloxetine is associated with small mean increases from baseline to endpoint in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and alkaline phosphatase, with modest and transient abnormal values observed in duloxetine-treated patients relative to those treated with placebo.

4. **Special Populations:**

   Use in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis is contraindicated due to the potential risk of hepatic injury.

The inclusion of hepatotoxicity in the “Warnings and Precautions” section, the data from clinical trials demonstrating liver enzyme elevations, and the postmarketing reports of liver injury suggest that there is evidence supporting a link between duloxetine exposure and the risk of acute liver injury. Health care providers prescribing duloxetine should consider these risks and monitor liver function tests, especially in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those who consume substantial amounts of alcohol. The risk of hepatotoxicity is a critical factor to weigh against the therapeutic benefits of duloxetine in managing conditions such as major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.",NA
acute liver injury,durvalumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no evidence directly linking durvalumab (IMFINZI) with acute liver injury as an adverse reaction in the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance reported within the label.

Durvalumab is associated with other immune-mediated adverse reactions involving various organ systems that are detailed in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label. These include immune-mediated hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver due to an immune response, and it was reported in 2.8% of patients treated with durvalumab as a single agent (52/1889). Incidences of immune-mediated hepatitis were higher when durvalumab was combined with tremelimumab-actl—7.5% (29/388) of patients—and when used with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy—3.9% (23/596) of patients.

The incidence of severe or fatal immune-mediated hepatitis was as follows:
- Fatal reactions were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving durvalumab as a single agent.
- Fatal immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab-actl.
- Fatal immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.3% of patients receiving the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy.

Furthermore, management of these reactions was described, noting that events resolved in some patients but led to permanent discontinuation in others, indicating a link between the drug and the adverse event.

Despite the absence of explicit mention of ""acute liver injury"" as a common adverse reaction, immune-mediated hepatitis is a serious adverse reaction that involves liver injury and thus might be considered related to liver toxicity. The liver function of patients on durvarumab should be monitored, and the drug should be discontinued if immune-mediated hepatitis occurs.

The evidence reviewed is based on the clinical experience from the trials 'PACIFIC', 'HIMALAYA', 'POSEIDON', 'CASPIAN', 'TOPAZ-1', and additional studies referenced in the drug label. There is no mention of post-marketing surveillance data for acute liver injury in this section of the drug label. 

If additional post-marketing data were to be evaluated, it would be sourced from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) public dashboard or published case reports and observational studies. However, such data is not provided or referenced in the drug label sections shared.",NA
acute liver injury,duvelisib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and drug exposure to duvelisib (marketed as COPIKTRA) primarily comes from clinical trials data and the warnings section of the drug's prescribing information.

- **Clinical Trials Data:**
  In the clinical trials detailed in the prescribing information for COPIKTRA, acute liver injury was observed among patients treated with the drug. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are indicators of liver injury, were reported.

  For the 442 patients included in the safety analysis, representing various hematologic malignancies, Grade 3 and 4 ALT and/or AST elevation developed in 8% and 2%, respectively. Two percent of patients experienced concomitant increases in ALT or AST greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN – a combined pattern of labs that are concerning for drug-induced liver injury. The median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2 months, with a median event duration of 1 month.

- **Warnings Section of the Drug Label:**
  The prescribing information for COPIKTRA includes a specific warning regarding hepatotoxicity (Section 5.5). It states that monitoring hepatic function during treatment with COPIKTRA is necessary. The label advises that for Grade 2 transaminase elevation, the drug should be maintained at the same dose; for Grade 3, it should be withheld and then resumed at the same or a reduced dose upon improvement; for Grade 4 elevation, COPIKTRA should be discontinued.

The combination of clinical trial results, the pattern of the liver enzyme elevations, and the specific warnings for hepatotoxicity support the association between acute liver injury and duvelisib exposure. It should be noted that such side effects require careful monitoring and management as outlined in the prescribing information and that the risk of hepatotoxicity is an established part of the drug's safety profile.

The evidence is sourced directly from the drug's prescribing information provided in the question, which includes data from clinical trials and mandates in the warnings and precautions section related to hepatotoxicity.","NA

The evidence provided in the drug label sections for duvelisib (COPIKTRA) includes hepatotoxicity as a known adverse reaction. The label explicitly mentions that Grade 3 and 4 ALT and/or AST elevation developed in 8% and 2%, respectively, of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). Additionally, 2% of patients had both an ALT or AST greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and duvelisib—it is, in fact, identified as an adverse reaction associated with the drug."
acute liver injury,efavirenz,1.0,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for efavirenz, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and efavirenz exposure. The following are key points drawn from the relevant drug label sections:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:** Hepatotoxicity is mentioned as one of the most significant adverse reactions observed in patients treated with efavirenz. The liver function test abnormalities such as increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were also reported in clinical trials with a higher frequency in patients treated with efavirenz than control. Specifically, elevations in ALT to greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 5-8% of efavirenz-treated patients in Study 006 and ACTG 364. Additionally, instances of hepatitis and hepatic failure have been reported postmarketing.

2. **Laboratory Abnormalities:** Selected Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in efavirenz-treated patients include elevated ALT and AST, which are indicators of liver injury. Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), which may also reflect enzyme induction not necessarily associated with liver toxicity, was seen in some efavirenz-treated patients.

3. **Patients Coinfected with Hepatitis B or C:** For patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C, monitoring of liver functions during treatment with efavirenz is emphasized due to an increased risk of further liver damage. The drug label mentions that in Study 006, patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C, who were treated with efavirenz-containing regimens, exhibited higher rates of AST and ALT elevations than those treated with a control regimen. Some coinfected patients discontinued due to liver or biliary system disorders.

4. **Postmarketing Experience:** Postmarketing cases have reported hepatic failure, hepatitis, and hepatic enzyme increase, which have been identified during the postapproval use of efavirenz. These reports contribute to the evidence, although causality is more difficult to establish due to potential reporting biases and confounding factors inherent to postmarket surveillance data.

5. **Warnings and Precautions:** The label advises caution in prescribing efavirenz to patients with pre-existing liver disease, including hepatitis B or C coinfection, due to the risk of hepatic injury. It is recommended to monitor liver function tests before and during treatment and consider discontinuing efavirenz if there is a persistent elevation of serum transaminases, signs, or symptoms of hepatitis, or hepatic decompensation.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials, laboratory abnormalities, and post-marketing experience indicates that there is an association between efavirenz use and the potential for acute liver injury. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with efavirenz, particularly in patients with underlying hepatic disease or hepatitis co-infection, and to discontinue use if significant liver injury is suspected.",NA
acute liver injury,eletriptan,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for eletriptan, there is no direct evidence cited in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance reports that links eletriptan to acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions mentioned in the label include asthenia, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia, flushing/feeling of warmth, chest/tightness/pain/pressure, dry mouth, dyspepsia, dysphagia, headache, and asthenia, among others. These reactions appear to be dose-related and are more frequent than those occurring with placebo at incidences greater than or equal to 2%.

In the post-marketing experience, some neurological adverse reactions (such as seizures) and digestive issues (such as vomiting) have been reported. However, there is no mention of liver issues in post-marketing surveillance within the provided sections of the label.

Additionally, the warnings and precautions sections discuss other potential risks and adverse events related to the cardiovascular system, including myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebrovascular events, and increases in blood pressure. There are also mentions of gastrointestinal ischemia, serotonin syndrome, anaphylactic reactions, and the risk of allergic reactions due to tartrazine in the 20 mg tablets.

Given the available information in the label, the relationship between eletriptan and acute liver injury is not supported by the cited evidence. If this is a concern or an observed reaction, it may require further investigation or reporting to the appropriate regulatory agency, such as the FDA MedWatch program, for potential inclusion in future updates if indeed a causal relationship is established. It may also be informative to review medical literature and databases for any case reports or observational studies that might shed additional light on this issue, even if such data might not have been explicitly included in the label.",NA
acute liver injury,elotuzumab,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Elotuzumab:

Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used in combination with other drugs (e.g., lenalidomide and dexamethasone) for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least one prior therapy. The provided sections of the drug label discuss various adverse reactions and warnings associated with elotizumab but do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction.

Relevant Sections of the Drug Label:
- Section 6, ""ADVERSE REACTIONS,"" does not list acute liver injury as a most common adverse reaction (≥20%) in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.
- However, hepatotoxicity is noted under Section 5.4, ""Hepatotoxicity,"" which indicates monitoring for liver function is required, and elotuzumab should be stopped if hepatotoxicity is suspected.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The safety data from clinical trials ELOQUENT-2 and ELOQUENT-3—based on comparing patients treated with elotuzumab in combination therapies versus control groups—do not report acute liver injury as a frequent event but note some laboratory abnormalities related to liver function:
- In Table 7, ELOQUENT-2 shows a minimal increase in liver-related laboratory abnormalities (elevated alkaline phosphatase) in the elotuzumab group compared to the control group.

Immunogenicity and Hepatotoxicity:
- Of the patients evaluated for immunogenicity across four clinical studies and the ELOQUENT-3 trial, there was a presence of treatment-emergent anti-product antibodies but no specific mention of acute liver injury.
- Section 5.4, which addresses hepatotoxicity, reports that hepatic transaminase elevations consistent with hepatotoxicity occurred in 2.5% of E-Ld-treated patients in ELOQUENT-2, suggesting a potential for liver-related adverse reactions linked to elotuzumab.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- The drug label does not provide direct information on post-marketing surveillance concerning acute liver injury.

In conclusion, while the drug label and provided clinical trial data for elotuzumab suggest some rare occurrences of hepatotoxicity, acute liver injury is not identified as a common adverse reaction. The drug label recommends monitoring liver function and discontinuing elotuzumab if hepatotoxicity is detected. If more detailed information or recent post-marketing data are required, further review of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) or research literature may provide additional insights into the relationship between acute liver injury and elotuzumab exposure.",NA
acute liver injury,eltrombopag,,"Evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance suggests that there is a relationship between eltrombopag (PROMACTTA) use and the risk of acute liver injury or hepatotoxicity. This is supported by several sections of the drug label:

1. **Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions**: The label includes a boxed warning about the risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with chronic hepatitis C when treated with eltrombopag in combination with interferon and ribavirin and the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity. This warning underlines the significance of liver-related risks and the necessity to monitor liver function.

2. **Hepatotoxicity**: In clinical trials, hepatotoxicity was noted, and eltrombopag has been associated with increased ALT and AST levels, which are indicators of liver injury. Serum liver tests should be monitored before and during eltrombopag therapy, and the drug should be discontinued if specific criteria indicating liver injury are met. Instances of drug-induced liver injury were reported at less than 1% in ITP patients and 1% in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with eltrombopag.

3. **Adverse Reactions (6.1) Clinical Trials Experience**: In clinical trials, abnormal liver function tests (especially ALT and AST elevation) were observed in patients treated with eltrombopag compared to placebo. In the controlled trials for persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there were reports of liver test abnormalities resulting in discontinuation in a small percentage of patients. In an extension trial, additional patients discontinued eltrombopag due to liver test abnormalities.

4. **Adverse Reactions in Chronic Hepatitis C-associated Thrombocytopenia**: In two controlled clinical trials involving patients with chronic hepatitis C, hyperbilirubinemia (a sign of liver dysfunction) was reported more frequently in patients receiving eltrombopag compared to those on placebo. Additionally, a higher incidence of ALT and AST elevations was observed.

5. **Postmarketing Experience**: Postmarketing surveillance has also identified hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction, although due to its voluntary nature, it is difficult to accurately estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship.

6. **Hepatic Decompensation**: In patients with chronic hepatitis C, eltrombopag used in combination with antivirals was associated with a higher incidence of hepatic decompensation compared to antivirals with placebo.

In conclusion, clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance provide evidence that acute liver injury, manifesting as elevations in liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia, is a potential adverse reaction associated with eltrombopag treatment. Monitoring liver function is recommended before and during therapy with eltrombopag, and the drug should be discontinued if hepatic function deteriorates. Clinicians should be cautious and follow dosing guidelines to prevent complications related to hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,eltrombopag,,"Eltrombopag, sold under the brand name PROMACTA, has been associated with acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. This relationship is supported by evidence from clinical trials, postmarketing experiences, and mechanisms outlined in the drug's warnings and precautions sections.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
- Across clinical trials for various conditions, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), chronic hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia, and severe aplastic anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, which are indicative of liver injury, were observed more frequently in patients receiving eltrombopag compared to placebo.
- In clinical trials for chronic ITP, liver test abnormalities (predominantly Grade 2 or less in severity) were reported in 11% of patients for eltrombopag versus 7% for placebo.
- In clinical trials involving patients with chronic hepatitis C, drug-induced liver injury occurred in 11 patients (1%) treated with eltrombopag.
- Liver function abnormalities were noted as an adverse reaction in up to 29% of patients treated with eltrombopag in severe aplastic anemia clinical trials.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
- Postmarketing experience has further identified adverse reactions related to hepatotoxicity, although the frequency and causal relationship to drug exposure are less certain.

Boxed Warnings:
- Eltrombopag has a boxed warning indicating a risk of severe and potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity. Patients undergoing treatment with eltrombopag, particularly those with chronic hepatitis C, may experience increased risks of hepatic decompensation.
- The warning advises monitoring liver function before and during therapy with eltrombopag, suggesting caution due to the potential of severe hepatotoxicity.

Mechanism:
- Eltrombopag may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinemia by inhibiting UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. It is recommended that abnormal liver tests be evaluated promptly and monitored until resolved or stabilized.

Given this evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing data, alongside the clearly stated risks in the drug’s boxed warnings, there is substantial support for the relationship between acute liver injury and eltrombopag exposure. Monitoring liver function is crucial for patients on eltrombopag, and the drug should be discontinued if significant liver injury is suspected.",NA
acute liver injury,enalapril,,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Enalapril:

The relationship between acute liver injury and enalapril use is supported by clinical evidence, as detailed in the adverse reactions section of the drug label. 

Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label mentions that enalapril maleate has been evaluated for safety in more than 10,000 patients, including those treated for over a year, and has been found to be generally well tolerated in controlled clinical trials.

However, hepatic failure and hepatitis (both hepatocellular, which has been proven on rechallenge, and cholestatic jaundice) are listed as adverse events occurring since the drug was marketed. These hepatic adverse reactions are categorized under the ""Digestive"" side effects and have been identified through post-marketing surveillance, which includes data from both controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials as well as reports after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use.

This aforementioned information suggests that although liver injuries such as hepatitis are not reported as common adverse reactions, there have been instances where there is a clear temporal association between the onset of liver injury and enalapril exposure. The mentioning of rechallenge in the context of hepatocellular damage strongly implies a causal relationship, as a rechallenge involves the reintroduction of the drug after an adverse reaction and is a robust method to confirm drug-induced liver injury when the injury recurs upon re-exposure.

Additionally, under the ""Liver Function Tests"" section, elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin are noted, which indicates potential hepatic impairment or injury.

Taken together, this evidence from post-marketing reports and clinical observations supports the relationship between acute liver injury and enalapril exposure, albeit such occurrences may be infrequent and not commonly observed in controlled trials.

Source: Drug label information as provided in the query.","NA

Available evidence, including clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, links enalapril to potential hepatic side effects. The drug label specifically mentions occurrences of hepatitis (either hepatocellular or cholestatic jaundice) and hepatic failure in relation to enalapril use. These hepatic issues are noted under both ""Digestive"" adverse experiences and ""Warnings,"" suggesting a recognized association, although potentially rare, between enalapril and liver injury. Therefore, there is evidence to support that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction to enalapril, and no refuting evidence has been provided."
acute liver injury,enalaprilat,1.0,"The drug label for enalaprilat, provided for analysis, mentions various adverse reactions associated with the use of the drug, categorized by body systems. Among the digestive adverse reactions, it lists ""hepatic failure, hepatitis (hepatocellular [proven on rechallenge] or cholestatic jaundice)"" indicating that liver injuries, including acute liver injury, have been associated with enalapril use. The label specifically mentions hepatic failure as a warning, which underscores the severity and potential for this adverse event.

Although the label notes hepatic failure, it doesn't specify the frequency of acute liver injury events in the context of enalaprilat use. It can be deduced that such events are relatively rare or occur under certain predisposing conditions since they are not among the most frequently reported adverse events. Moreover, the term ""proven on rechallenge"" indicates that at least some instances of hepatocellular injury were confirmed to be caused by the drug after the reintroduction of the drug led to a recurrent adverse hepatic reaction, thus supporting the causality between enalaprilat use and hepatic injury.

Since the label does include liver related adverse effects such as hepatitis and elevations of liver enzymes/bilirubin, it suggests that there is some evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure. However, for a specific and detailed evaluation of the evidence, one would need to review the actual clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance reports that led to the inclusion of these warnings on the drug label. This data would give insights into the incidence rate, the severity, patient characteristics, time to onset, and outcomes of the liver injury, as well as any identified risk factors.

In summary, the provided drug label for enalaprilat includes liver injury as a potential adverse reaction, with hepatic failure explicitly mentioned under warnings, which indicates a recognized relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to enalaprilat. Although the label does not provide detailed evidence such as specific clinical trial results, case reports, or incidence rates of this adverse effect, the inclusion of hepatic failure in the label suggests that evidence exists and was significant enough to warrant its inclusion.",NA
acute liver injury,encorafenib,,"The drug label sections provided contain information regarding hepatoxicity associated with Encorafenib (BRAFTOVI) usage, particularly when combined with binimetinib or cetuximab. Here is a summary of the key evidence:

Clinical Trials:

1. Hepatotoxicity noted in clinical trials (Section 5.4):
   - **COLUMBUS trial**: Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests were observed in 6% of patients for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase.
   - **PHAROS trial**: Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests were seen in 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase.

Laboratory Abnormalities (Section 6):

1. In the **COLUMBUS** trial (metastatic melanoma), increased ALT occurred in 29% of patients with 6% experiencing Grade 3 or 4 reactions. Increased AST occurred in 27% of patients, with 2.6% being Grade 3 or 4 (Section 6.1).

2. In the **BEACON CRC** trial (metastatic colorectal cancer), increased ALT was reported in 17% and increased AST in 15% of patients with relevant Grade 3 and 4 rates.

3. In the **PHAROS** trial (metastatic non-small cell lung cancer), increased ALT occurred in 34% of patients, with 9% being Grade 3 or 4, and increased AST in 31% with 10% being Grade 3 or 4.

Warnings and Precautions (Section 5):

1. **Hepatotoxicity**: Section 5.4 explicitly mentions a warning about hepatotoxicity, advising monitoring of liver function tests before and during treatment.

2. **Risk Management**: Recommendations for managing hepatotoxicity include withholding, reducing dose, or discontinuing Encorafenib based on severity (Section 5.4).

There are no specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data provided in the label sections presented. While acute liver injury as an adverse reaction is not explicitly mentioned, hepatotoxicity, which could potentially lead to acute liver injury, is clearly identified as a risk with Encorafenib use based on clinical trial data and laboratory abnormalities observed. The drug label advises careful monitoring of liver function and provides guidance on management should hepatotoxicity occur.

For further details and context that may not be covered in the label sections provided, you may want to consult additional sources such as peer-reviewed studies or post-marketing reports for Encorafenib. However, based on the information available in the drug label, there is evidence supporting the relationship between hepatotoxicity risk and Encorafenib use, particularly when combined with other medications like binimetinib or cetuximab.",NA
acute liver injury,entecavir,,"Evidence for the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury related to entecavir exposure can be summarized from the provided drug label sections which include information from clinical trials, laboratory abnormalities, as well as postmarketing reports:

1. **Clinical Trials**: 
   The clinical trial experience does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction for entecavir. The most common adverse reactions of entecavir-treated subjects in four clinical trials (AI463014, AI463022, AI463026, and AI463027) were headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. ALT elevations were noted, but these are not necessarily indicative of acute liver injury and often resolved with continued treatment.

2. **Laboratory Abnormalities**:
   Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities related to liver function observed during clinical trials include ALT elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and greater than 2 times baseline. It is important to note that these ALT elevations generally resolved with continued treatment and were often associated with a significant reduction in viral load.

3. **Exacerbations of Hepatitis After Discontinuation**:
   There have been reports of exacerbations of hepatitis, defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the patient's reference level, after discontinuation of entecavir therapy.

4. **Postmarketing Experience**:
   Postmarketing reports include increased transaminases and hepatic disorders, but these voluntary reports do not allow for a reliable estimate of frequency or a clear establishment of a causal relationship to entecavir exposure. Acute liver injury as a specific adverse event is not explicitly listed.

5. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   The labeling includes warnings about severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B following discontinuation of therapy with entecavir, which, while not specifically named as acute liver injury, may reflect serious hepatic adverse effects. Additionally, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis have been reported with the use of nucleoside analog inhibitors, including entecavir. These are serious liver-related adverse effects that can potentially lead to fatal outcomes.

In conclusion, the provided sections of the drug label do not specifically list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction to entecavir in the context of clinical trials. However, they do note the potential for exacerbation of hepatitis and increased transaminases, which are indications of liver stress or injury, especially after discontinuation of the drug. Laboratory abnormalities reported in clinical trials related to liver function suggest a potential for liver-related adverse events, while postmarketing surveillance indicates that cases of hepatic disorders have occurred. Increased monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during and after cessation of entecavir treatment to manage potential liver-related adverse reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,epcoritamab,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically associated with epcoritamab (EPKINLY) in the context of the clinical trial EPCORE NHL-1 or in the warnings section.

However, laboratory abnormalities were reported in the clinical trial, including increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in 48% of patients and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 45% of patients, with 4.6% and 5.3% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 elevations, respectively. AST and ALT are enzymes that can indicate liver injury when present in elevated levels in the bloodstream. Additionally, a single fatal adverse reaction related to hepatotoxicity (0.6%) was reported. Hepatotoxicity refers to liver damage, and while it is a broader term than acute liver injury, it does suggest that liver-related adverse reactions can occur.

To summarize, while acute liver injury per se is not listed as a common adverse reaction, laboratory evidence of liver enzyme elevations and a reported fatal adverse reaction of hepatotoxicity in the clinical trials suggest that liver injury, potentially including acute liver injury, is a possible adverse reaction to epcoritamab. Close monitoring of liver function is thus warranted in patients receiving the drug. There is no information provided regarding case studies or post-marketing surveillance data in the provided sections. For a comprehensive risk assessment, a full review of the latest post-marketing data and literature would be advisable.",NA
acute liver injury,eplerenone,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, there is no direct evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction to eplerenone. The provided sections focus on adverse reactions such as hyperkalemia, increased creatinine, and other documented side effects from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, but they do not mention acute liver injury. 

The clinical trial evidence summarized within the label indicates that the most common adverse reactions associated with eplerenone in the heart failure post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) population were hyperkalemia and increased creatinine. It also shows an overall incidence of adverse events reported with eplerenone comparable to placebo. Discontinuations due to adverse events were similar between eplerenone and placebo, with hyperkalemia and abnormal renal function as the most common reasons for discontinuation. 

In hypertension studies, adverse events such as headache, dizziness, angina pectoris/MI, and increased GGT were reasons for discontinuation in some cases, but these did not include liver injury. Moreover, although gynecomastia and abnormal vaginal bleeding were documented in relation to eplerenone use, no liver-related adverse events were reported.

During post-marketing surveillance, skin reactions like angioneurotic edema and rash were identified. However, there is no mention of liver injury in the provided label sections.

While it is always possible for new adverse reactions to emerge as more post-marketing data are collected, at this time, according to the provided label information, there is no known evidence that eplerenone is associated with acute liver injury. If there are concerns about a potential link between eplerenone and liver injury, it may warrant further investigation but would not be supported by the current label information provided here. It is important to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities such as the FDA's MedWatch program to aid in the detection of less common or delayed adverse effects.",NA
acute liver injury,epoprostenol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label of epoprostenol (brand name Flolan), there is no direct mention of acute liver injury being a common adverse reaction associated with its use. The documented adverse reactions are primarily related to vasodilation effects, such as dizziness, jaw pain, headache, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea/vomiting.

In the section describing the post-marketing experience, ""Hepatic failure"" is listed under ""Gastrointestinal"" adverse events. This suggests that there have been reports of hepatic failure in patients taking epoprostenol, identified through postapproval use of the drug. However, the drug label specifies that due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertain size of the population, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

It is worth noting that hepatic failure is a severe form of liver injury, which could align with concerns about acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction. Nonetheless, the drug label data presented does not quantify this risk nor does it provide detailed evidence necessary to clearly establish a direct causal relationship between epoprostenol use and acute liver injury.

In conclusion, while hepatic failure is mentioned as an adverse event in the post-marketing surveillance of epoprostenol, the evidence from the drug label does not provide sufficient details to confirm acute liver injury as a clearly established adverse reaction owing to drug exposure. Additional evidence such as clinical trials or case studies investigating the specific relationship between epoprostenol and acute liver injury would be needed for a more definitive evaluation.","Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence in the adverse reactions (Section 6), warnings, and boxed warnings of the drug label that acute liver injury is an established adverse reaction linked to the use of epoprostenol (FLOLAN). While hepatic failure is mentioned in the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), this does not establish a causal relationship to drug exposure, as postmarketing reports are voluntarily reported and their frequency or causal connection to the drug cannot be reliably estimated.

Therefore, we can state that, according to the presented sections of the drug label, there's no conclusive evidence refuting or establishing acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to epoprostenol. However, postmarketing data does suggest a potential association with hepatic failure, necessitating further investigation to clarify this relationship. It is essential to consider the entirety of the medical literature and post-marketing surveillance data to form a conclusive assessment. If additional studies or reports have been published outside the provided drug label that provides evidence to refute the relationship, those sources were not included in your provided information and would need to be reviewed for a comprehensive evaluation."
acute liver injury,eribulin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for eribulin (HALAVEN), acute liver injury is mentioned as a potential adverse reaction in the context of liver function test abnormalities observed during clinical study experiences. However, acute liver injury itself is not explicitly described as a common adverse reaction. Here are the pertinent findings from the label:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Section 6.1 details adverse reactions found during clinical trials. Liver function test abnormalities were reported, specifically noting that among patients with Grade 0 or 1 ALT levels at baseline, 18% of HALAVEN-treated patients experienced Grade 2 or greater ALT elevation. There was a single case of a patient without documented liver metastases who had concomitant Grade 2 elevations in bilirubin and ALT, but these issues resolved and did not recur with re-exposure to HALAVEN. This indicates a potential for liver enzyme elevations but does not directly cite acute liver injury as a common adverse event.

2. **Postmarketing Experience**: In section 6.2, hepatotoxicity is listed among adverse drug reactions identified during post-approval of HALAVEN. However, because postmarketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency of hepatotoxicity (which includes acute liver injury) or establish a definite causal relationship to eribulin exposure.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**: Sections 5.1 and 5.2 mention that patients with elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST > 3 × ULN) and bilirubin (> 1.5 × ULN) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. However, there is no specific warning or precaution regarding acute liver injury, suggesting that while there is a known impact on liver enzymes, acute liver injury is not highlighted as a major concern based on clinical trial data.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections suggest that while there is evidence of liver enzyme elevations (ALT and AST) in patients treated with HALAVEN, these are not directly equated with acute liver injury in the data from clinical trials. In postmarketing experience, hepatotoxicity has been reported, but the frequency and causal relationship to eribulin remain uncertain. Acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction does not appear to be a prominent feature in the available clinical trial data for eribulin. For a definitive association between eribulin and acute liver injury, more targeted studies or case reports would be necessary.",NA
acute liver injury,erlotinib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and erlotinib exposure comes from multiple sections in the provided drug label including warnings, clinical trial experience, and post-marketing surveillance. Here is a concise summary of the evidence:

1. **Clinical Trial Experience**:
    - **Study 1**: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with erlotinib, there was one reported case of fatal hepatic failure and four additional patients experienced Grade 3 to 4 liver test abnormalities.
    - **Maintenance and Second/Third Line Treatment**: Liver test abnormalities, including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin, were observed in erlotinib-treated patients, with some cases being transient or associated with liver metastases. No Grade 3 ALT elevations were observed in erlotinib-treated patients, and dosage adjustments were recommended for significant changes in liver function.
    - **Pancreatic Cancer**: In patients with pancreatic cancer treated with erlotinib plus gemcitabine, there were instances of liver test abnormalities (Grade 2 and above bilirubin elevations and ALT elevations), suggesting a risk of hepatotoxicity.

2. **Warnings and Precautions** (Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment):
    - Erlotinib can cause hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, with the incidence of hepatic failure being 0.4% in erlotinib arms across three monotherapy lung cancer studies.
    - There is an increased risk of hepatic toxicity in patients with baseline hepatic impairment.
    - The recommendation is for periodic liver testing and increased monitoring frequency in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction.
    - Erlotinib administration should be withheld or discontinued in patients with severe or worsening liver test abnormalities.

3. **Post-Marketing Experience**:
    - Post-approval adverse reactions include hepatotoxicity and other liver-related abnormalities, and the reporting suggests that these events have been identified in the real-world setting after the drug entered the market.

Given the label's enumerated adverse reactions, clinical trial data, and the reporting of hepatic events in post-marketing use, there is evidence supporting a relationship between erlotinib exposure and acute liver injury. Patients who are treated with erlotinib should be closely monitored for liver function to mitigate the risk of hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,escitalopram,,"Based on the provided drug label information for escitalopram, acute liver injury is not listed among the most commonly observed adverse reactions nor explicitly detailed in the sections provided (sections 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, and 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience). In the clinical trials mentioned, adverse reactions were collected from patients with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to escitalopram, but liver injury is not specifically cited as a frequent or notable adverse event.

The liver-related adverse reactions mentioned in the post-marketing experience of escitalopram are fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis. However, it is important to note that these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and thus, causality and frequency are challenging to establish. Despite the lack of detailed information on the incidence or context of these liver-related reactions, their mention suggests that there have been some reported cases of acute liver injury potentially related to escitalopram use after the drug was released into the market.

The important thing to remember is that post-marketing reports do not establish a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event due to the voluntary nature of reporting and lack of a control group. There is a need for a comprehensive evaluation of these events to determine causality. For a conclusive determination, further examination through clinical studies, case reviews, or epidemiological investigations would be required.

If healthcare providers suspect an association between escitalopram and acute liver injury in specific cases, it is critical for them to report these occurrences to regulatory authorities such as the FDA or appropriate drug safety surveillance programs to aid in the ongoing assessment of the drug's safety profile.","The provided drug label sections list various adverse reactions and warnings associated with escitalopram but do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an observed adverse reaction in the controlled trials or post-marketing experience.

Acute liver injury is thus not listed as a known adverse reaction of escitalopram in these provided sections. However, it's important to note that while acute liver injury is not mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label, this does not constitute definitive evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and escitalopram use. Adverse reactions may sometimes occur at frequencies that are not captured in clinical trial populations or may not have been reported in the post-marketing surveillance data. 

To conclusively refute the relationship between acute liver injury and escitalopram would require specific studies or population-based data examining the incidence of liver injury in patients exposed to escitalopram compared to an appropriate control group. Absence of mention in the drug label suggests that if such a relationship exists, it was either not detected or not considered significant based on the available evidence at the time of the label's last update. 

To provide a more definitive summary regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and escitalopram, further information from large-scale epidemiological studies, clinical trials, or hepatotoxicity registries would be necessary. As such, based on the information available in the provided sections of the drug label, there is no evidence listed that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction to escitalopram. However, without additional context from full safety studies or liver-specific adverse event reports, no comprehensive conclusion can be made."
acute liver injury,eslicarbazepine,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between drug-induced liver injury and eslicarbazepine exposure is provided in the clinical trial data and post-marketing experience as detailed in the adverse reactions and warnings sections of the drug label.

Clinical Trials:
In the clinical trials section under ""Adverse Reactions"" (section 6.1), it is noted that drug-induced liver injury is discussed further in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.8). However, specific data on the incidence of acute liver injury in the clinical trials is not provided in the sections supplied.

Warnings and Precautions:
In the Warnings and Precautions section (5.8), concerning drug-induced liver injury, it is mentioned that eslicarbazepine has been associated with hepatic effects ranging from mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases with concomitant increases in total bilirubin. These findings suggest that liver function tests should be monitored and the medication discontinued if there is evidence of significant liver injury. The presence of elevated liver enzymes along with elevated bilirubin, absent evidence of obstruction, is mentioned as an important predictor of severe liver injury, warranting discontinuation of the drug.

Postmarketing Experience:
In the Postmarketing Experience section (6.2), liver injury, although not specifically labeled as ""acute liver injury,"" is reported as an adverse reaction identified during the postapproval use of eslicarbazepine. Due to the nature of postmarketing reporting, the frequency of this reaction or establishing a causal relationship to eslicarbazepine exposure is challenging. However, cases of liver injury, including the severe forms accompanied by jaundice and significant liver injury, are documented.

Conclusion:
The evidence linking eslicarbazepine to drug-induced liver injury includes documented cases of elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels in clinical trial subjects, as well as reports of liver injury in the postmarketing experience. While detailed incidence rates and case studies are not provided in the sections specified, the official prescribing information advises monitoring liver function and considering the discontinuation of eslicarbazepine if significant liver injury is detected. This evidence underlines the recognition of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to eslicarbazepine exposure.",NA
acute liver injury,eslicarbazepine,,"The adverse reaction of acute liver injury related to eslicarbazepine (marketed under the name APTIOM) can be supported by the drug's labeling information, specifically from the Warnings and Precautions section:

1. **Clinical Trials Evidence**:
   - Clinical trials experience as described in section 6.1 of the label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions in adult patients receiving APTIOM are listed as dizziness, somnolence, nausea, headache, diplopia, vomiting, fatigue, vertigo, ataxia, blurred vision, and tremor. Acute liver injury is not specified among these reactions.
   - However, section 5.8 specifically addresses ""Drug Induced Liver Injury,"" stating hepatic effects ranging from mild to moderate elevations in transaminases to rare cases with elevations in total bilirubin have been reported. While the label does not detail the exact frequency or severity of acute liver injury in its clinical trials, it is clear from section 5.8 that such an adverse reaction is recognized based on clinical trial data.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence**:
   - In the Postmarketing Experience detailed in section 6.2 of the labeling information, additional hematologic and metabolism and nutrition disorders including effects on liver function such as ""syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)"" are reported, but there are no specific mentions regarding acute liver injury.
   - Again, section 5.8 on Drug Induced Liver Injury suggests that post-marketing reports have included liver injuries with APTIOM, but detailed information about the diagnosis of acute liver injury after marketing is not given in this summary.

Based on the sections provided, it can be confirmed that the potential for drug-induced liver injury, which can include acute liver injury as a manifestation, is recognized both in clinical trials data and post-marketing experience with eslicarbazepine. However, the label does not indicate the prevalence of acute liver injury as a common reaction in a manner similar to other listed adverse reactions. Therefore, while liver injury is an identified risk with this drug, the summary provided does not allow for a precise estimation of the incidence or characterization of acute liver injury specifically. Health professionals are urged to monitor liver function tests and discontinue eslicarbazepine in patients showing signs of jaundice or significant liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,esomeprazole,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for esomeprazole, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials experience section (6.1) or in the majority of adverse reactions described within related summaries of the drug's safety profile.

Within the clinical trials experience detailed in the drug label, hepatobiliary adverse reactions mentioned include increased levels of liver enzymes such as SGOT and SGPT (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), which are markers of liver injury, but this is listed with an incidence of less than 1% and without clear attribution to acute liver injury.

In the postmarketing experience (6.2), there are reports of hepatic failure and hepatitis with or without jaundice which may imply severe liver injury. However, these postmarketing findings are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and it is difficult to establish causation due to the voluntary nature and lack of rigorous data collection inherent in postmarketing surveillance.

Overall, the direct evidence linking esomeprazole to acute liver injury would be considered limited based on the supplied drug labeling information. The liver-related adverse reactions mentioned are infrequent and less precise regarding the nature of the liver injury, and postmarketing reports require careful interpretation due to potential underreporting, confounding factors, and lack of control groups.

To conclusively determine whether acute liver injury is an adverse reaction to esomeprazole, further investigation and more definitive evidence would be needed, including additional case reports, clinical trial data, or more systematic postmarketing surveillance studies that establish a clear temporal and causal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse liver outcomes observed.",NA
acute liver injury,estradiol,,"The evidence summary provided does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to estradiol exposure. Estradiol, as a hormone replacement therapy (HRT), has been prescribed to alleviate menopausal symptoms and is commonly administered in various forms, including the MINIVELLE patch, which delivers estradiol transdermally.

From the information provided:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**:
   - MINIVELLE is bioequivalent to Vivelle®.
   - Adverse reactions reported for Vivelle in clinical trials included gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, infections, musculoskeletal issues, nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, respiratory conditions, and vascular disorders.
   - There is no specific mention of acute liver injury in the document sections provided from the clinical trials involving MINIVELLE or Vivelle®.

2. **Postmarketing Experience**:
   - Adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of MINIVELLE include breast enlargement, cardiovascular symptoms, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, skin reactions, CNS disorders, and others. However, acute liver injury is not listed among the postmarketing experiences.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   - The warnings and precautions address the risks of endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders, probable dementia, breast cancer, gallbladder disease, hypercalcemia, and other conditions.
   - Hepatic impairment and/or a past history of cholestatic jaundice are mentioned as conditions where estrogens like MINIVELLE may be poorly metabolized, and caution is advised.
   - It is recommended to discontinue use if cholestatic jaundice occurs.

Based on the evidence provided from the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance for estradiol as administered via the MINIVELLE patch, there is no direct mention or statistical correlation of acute liver injury listed in the adverse reactions or documented experiences. However, estradiol use is cautioned in individuals with hepatic impairment, as estrogens can be poorly metabolized in these patients and previous history of cholestatic jaundice is considered a risk factor when using estrogens.

Conclusively, based on the evidence provided in the clinical trial and post-marketing data, acute liver injury does not appear to be a commonly reported adverse reaction of estradiol exposure. However, for the most comprehensive assessment of the potential hepatic side effects of estradiol, it would be necessary to review a wider range of scientific literature, including case reports and epidemiological studies that may offer additional insight into rarer adverse hepatic reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,estradiol,,"The provided drug label information describes various adverse reactions and warnings for the use of combination oral contraceptives (COCs), including Natazia. However, there is no explicit mention in these sections of acute liver injury as a direct adverse reaction to estradiol or Natazia.

In the summary of the drug label cited, liver disease is referenced under ""Warnings and Precautions (5.3)"" where it advises discontinuation of Natazia if jaundice develops. This indicates that hepatic effects can occur, but it is not categorized as a common adverse reaction. Moreover, the section discusses the risk of liver conditions such as hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma generally associated with long-term COC use and not acute liver injury specifically.

The document also mentions several other liver-related issues, such as cholestasis and the need for caution in patients with impaired liver function, but it does not provide specific incidence rates or a clear causal linkage to acute liver injury.

Reviewing the provided clinical trials information and postmarketing experience, acute liver injury is not reported as a common adverse reaction. Still, the medication's association with various hepatic disorders suggests a potential relationship that could manifest in certain patients.

In conclusion, while there is recognition that COCs, including those containing estradiol such as Natazia, can be associated with hepatic disorders, there is no direct evidence within the provided label sections that explicitly links estradiol to acute liver injury. Monitoring for hepatic adverse effects is advised as per the warning sections. Further detailed analysis of clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance reports outside the provided document would be necessary to establish a more direct association between estradiol and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,eszopiclone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for eszopiclone, there is no direct evidence stated within these sections to suggest a relationship between acute liver injury and the usage of eszopiclone. The adverse reactions detailed focus primarily on central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as complex sleep behaviors, next-day impairment, and other changes in thinking and behavior, as well as various other potential reactions such as unpleasant taste, headache, somnolence, and respiratory infection.

Within the ""Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Eszopiclone"" section, there is mention of rare digestive system reactions including hepatitis, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and liver damage. However, these are categorized as rare (occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients). The statement also emphasizes that these reactions occurred during treatment with eszopiclone but were not necessarily caused by it.

Post-marketing surveillance, as indicated in the label, includes adverse events that have been reported spontaneously from a population of unknown size, making it difficult to estimate the true frequency of these events. Such spontaneous reports are a critical source of information on potential new adverse effects that may not have been identified during clinical trials due to their rare nature or limited sample sizes.

To be thorough in the assessment of the relationship between eszopiclone and acute liver injury, one would need to consult additional sources such as published case studies, pharmacovigilance databases, or the scientific literature. However, from the label information alone, while there are some rare instances of liver-related side effects noted, there is not enough evidence to draw a definitive connection between acute liver injury and eszopiclone use. Thus, while the relationship cannot be ruled out completely, the label does not provide strong or specific evidence to support this association.

It is important to monitor patients for any signs of liver injury during treatment with eszopiclone and report any suspected adverse reactions to health authorities, as per the guidance for healthcare professionals. Additionally, if other sources provide further evidence on this topic, that data would be important to consider in evaluating the relationship between eszopiclone and acute liver injury.","NA

There is no available evidence provided in the sections quoted from the drug label that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and eszopiclone exposure. The adverse reactions listed do not include acute liver injury as an observed adverse reaction or warning in the clinical trials or post-marketing experience for eszopiclone. Therefore, based on the information from the drug label sections provided, acute liver injury is not listed or identified as a known adverse reaction to eszopiclone. If there are any case studies, clinical trials, or post-marketing reports specifically investigating acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to eszopiclone that are not included in these label sections, those would need to be reviewed to accurately refute the relationship. However, based on these sections alone, there is no evidence suggesting a refutation of the relationship, primarily because acute liver injury is not mentioned at all."
acute liver injury,ethacrynate,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence suggesting that acute liver injury such as jaundice and abnormal liver function tests have been reported in patients that are seriously ill and are on multiple drug therapy including ethacrynic acid, which is the active ingredient in Ethacrynate. While this information suggests an association with acute liver injury, the evidence does not unambiguously establish a causal relationship because these occurrences have been rare and involved patients on multiple drugs, which complicates the attribution of the adverse reaction to a single agent like ethacrynic acid.

The drug label does not explicitly mention ""acute liver injury"" as a common adverse reaction but does include mentions of jaundice and abnormal liver function tests in the context of serious illness and multidrug regimens. The challenge in interpreting this information is the confounding effect of serious underlying illness and the concurrent use of other drugs, which might also have the potential to cause liver injury. Thus, from the provided sections of the drug label, the evidence of acute liver injury specifically due to ethacrynate is not strong and is confounded by other factors.

There is no mention of clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data that would provide a stronger basis for understanding the relationship between ethacrynate and acute liver injury. Additional information from large-scale observational studies, case reports where ethacrynate administration is the only change in a patient's regimen, or re-challenge cases where reintroduction of the drug leads to a repeat of the injury would offer more robust evidence of a potential causal relationship.

In summary, there is a mention of liver-related adverse effects in seriously ill patients receiving ethacrynic acid according to the provided sections of the drug label, but the presence of confounding factors weakens the evidence for a direct causal relationship between ethacrynate and acute liver injury. For a more definitive conclusion, additional specific data from controlled studies would be needed.",NA
acute liver injury,ethambutol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, ethambutol hydrochloride has been reported to cause various adverse reactions, with a focus on visual acuity issues such as optic neuritis. However, liver toxicities, including fatalities, have also been reported. According to the section ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" in the drug label, there are instances of liver toxicity that have occurred during ethambutol hydrochloride therapy, suggesting a potential link between the drug and hepatic adverse effects.

While the label indicates liver toxicities, it also mentions that these findings could be related to the concurrent therapy since ethambutol hydrochloride is commonly used in combination with other antituberculous drugs. This implies that it may be challenging to attribute liver injury solely to ethambutol without further investigative information because it could be a result of drug interactions or the effects of other medications taken concomitaneously.

The label does not provide specific data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that detail the extent or frequency of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to ethambutol. For a more robust assessment, additional data sources, such as published case reports, clinical trial results, or epidemiological studies, would be needed to establish a stronger causal relationship and characterize the risk of acute liver injury associated with ethambutol use.

In conclusion, while the drug label for ethambutol hydrochloride suggests the occurrence of liver toxicities, it does not provide detailed evidence to conclusively determine the relationship between acute liver injury and ethambutol exposure. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver function when prescribing ethambutol and consider the possibility of liver injury as a serious adverse reaction while acknowledging that the evidence from the label alone is insufficient to establish a definitive causal relationship. Further investigation from additional scientific and clinical data would be required to clarify this potential adverse effect.",NA
acute liver injury,etodolac,1.0,"Summary of Evidence for Etodolac-Related Acute Liver Injury:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The drug label for etodolac indicates that elevated liver enzymes have been documented in patients taking etodolac based on clinical trials. However, specific details on acute liver injury, such as the frequency or severity from these clinical trials, are not explicitly stated under the common adverse reactions, which include gastrointestinal symptoms, abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, and others.

Among the adverse reactions probable causally related to etodolac but reported in less than 1% of patients, the drug label includes elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic failure, liver necrosis, and peptic ulcer with or without bleeding and/or perforation as postmarketing experiences that were not seen in the clinical trials but were later reported.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:
Evidence of acute liver injury associated with etodolac has come to light from post-marketing surveillance, which collects data after the drug has been approved and is used in a broader patient population. These reports are typically less rigorous than controlled clinical trials but provide important safety information concerning rare adverse events.

The drug label lists under a section for rare post-marketing experiences, which includes various forms of liver injury: elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic hepatitis, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic failure, and liver necrosis. These adverse reactions were not observed in the clinical trials but were reported during the post-marketing use of the drug. It is important to note that these reports are less outlined in nature and rely on voluntary reporting, and may not establish a causal relationship as firmly as a randomized controlled trial.

The evidence indicates that while acute liver injury is not a common adverse reaction to etodolac, there have been rare reports of serious liver-related side effects in the post-marketing experience. Healthcare professionals should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction in patients taking etodolac and patients should be advised to report any symptoms suggestive of liver injury immediately.

Causal Relationship and Potential Risk Factors:
The less than 1% incidence for liver-related adverse reactions and the italicized noting of these reactions in the post-marketing section suggest a potential but rare causal relationship. As with most NSAIDs, the risk for such adverse reactions may be higher in certain populations, such as those with preexisting liver disease, those taking other hepatotoxic drugs, or patients with significant alcohol consumption.

Conclusion:
The evidence indicates that there is a potential relationship between etodolac exposure and acute liver injury, primarily manifested as rare cases reported through post-marketing surveillance, rather than common adverse reactions documented in controlled clinical trials. Clinicians should remain alert to this possibility and monitor liver function as appropriate. Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of liver injury and advised to seek medical attention promptly should they occur.",NA
acute liver injury,etoposide,,"The evidence available from the drug label sections you provided for Etoposide (ETOPOPHOS) does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction from clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The provided adverse reactions section (6.1) and post-marketing experience (6.2) mention various toxicities and side effects associated with the use of ETOPOPHOS. However, no mention is made of acute liver injury specifically as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trial participants or reported post-marketing.

The available information does mention hepatotoxicity under ""Other Important Adverse Reactions"" in section 6.1, but this does not necessarily imply acute liver injury. Hepatotoxicity is a broad term that can refer to liver damage due to chemicals. It is unclear from the information provided whether this encompasses acute liver injury or refers to other forms of liver toxicity. Additionally, the incidence and causality are not elaborated upon in this summary.

Without more specific data or case studies directly linking acute liver injury to ETOPOPHOS in the sections provided, we cannot accurately conclude a relationship between the drug exposure and this particular adverse reaction. Additional information, such as liver enzyme levels, imaging results, and clinical evaluations from individual cases or a broader data set, would be necessary to provide a definitive summary of evidence for this association.

It is important to note that while the information provided here does not list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, this does not completely rule out its possibility. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate channels, such as the Safety Call Center and FDA mentioned in section 6, to ensure comprehensive post-marketing surveillance.

In summary, based on the information available from the provided sections of the drug label for ETOPOPHOS, there is no explicit evidence listed that supports the occurrence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the drug. Hepatotoxicity is mentioned, but without specific details that confirm it includes acute liver injury as observed through clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.",NA
acute liver injury,etranacogene dezaparvovec,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute liver injury is suggested as a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of etranacogene dezaparvovec (commercial name HEMGENIX), particularly in the context of elevated liver enzymes as a proxy for hepatotoxicity.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
The safety of HEMGENIX was evaluated in two clinical studies involving adult male subjects with Hemophilia B. A single intravenous dose of 2 × 10^13 gc/kg body weight of HEMGENIX was administered to 57 subjects. There were no serious adverse reactions reported in these studies. However, there was an occurrence of elevated transaminases, an indicator of liver cell injury. Specifically, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was reported in 42% of subjects, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was also reported in 42% of subjects. These elevations often occurred within the first four months after administration of HEMGENIX. Although many of these elevated transaminase levels returned to baseline, nine subjects demonstrated values that had not normalized at the 2-year follow-up.

There was at least one report of an ALT elevation greater than five times the upper limit of normal which resolved over time. It should be noted that some subjects with elevated ALT levels received corticosteroid treatment, which can help manage immune-mediated liver injury.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
There is no evidence from post-marketing surveillance provided. However, the drug label includes instructions for reporting suspected adverse reactions to regulatory bodies.

**Box Warnings and Other Warnings:**
The label advises close monitoring of liver enzyme levels and the consideration of corticosteroid treatment for elevations. It also mentions the need to monitor transaminases in patients who develop liver enzyme elevations until they return to baseline.

**Summary:**
The available evidence from clinical trials indicates that there is a relationship between etranacogene dezaparvovec use and acute liver injury, primarily reflected through increased transaminase levels. No information from post-marketing surveillance is provided to further clarify this relationship. Monitoring and management guidelines are included on the label to address the risk of hepatotoxicity, underscoring its recognition as a potential adverse reaction.

**Sources:**
The summarized evidence is directly inferred from the provided drug label sections, which include adverse reactions, warnings, and detailed clinical trial data relevant to HEMGENIX. No external peer-reviewed studies or independent databases were provided or referenced in the question.",NA
acute liver injury,etravirine,,"Etravirine is associated with the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury, which is supported by various sources of evidence, including clinical trials and postmarketing experience.

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**:
   - The safety assessment of etravirine is based on Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials (TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216) involving 1203 HIV-1-infected adults, with 599 receiving etravirine (200 mg twice daily). Hepatobiliary disorders, including hepatic failure, hepatitis, and cytolytic hepatitis, were identified among less common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of at least moderate intensity (≥ Grade 2) occurring in less than 2% of subjects.
   - In the same Phase 3 trials, laboratory abnormalities related to the liver were reported. Specifically, Grade 2 to Grade 4 elevations in alanine amino transferase (ALT) occurred in 6% (Grade 2), 3% (Grade 3), and 1% (Grade 4) of etravirine-treated subjects. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) abnormalities were also observed at similar frequencies.
   - The incidence of liver enzyme elevations was notably higher in subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. Among these co-infected trial participants, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that reflect a worsening of AST, ALT, or total bilirubin occurred more frequently in those treated with etravirine compared to those who were not co-infected.

2. **Postmarketing Experience**:
   - Postmarketing reports have identified severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and cases of hepatic failure among patients taking etravirine. These events were reported voluntarily from an unknown population size, limiting the ability to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship reliably. Nonetheless, they suggest a risk of liver injury related to the drug.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   - The drug label carries warnings about the risk of severe skin reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of hepatic failure associated with etravirine. Patients developing severe rash or hypersensitivity reactions (which may involve liver injury as reflected by transaminase elevations) should discontinue etravirine immediately, and their clinical status, including liver transaminases, should be closely monitored.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance supports a relationship between etravirine exposure and the risk of acute liver injury. This adverse reaction is documented in the less common drug reactions during the trials, the laboratory abnormalities observed, and the postmarketing reports, as well as warnings and precautions in the drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,etravirine,,"The provided drug label sections primarily discuss adverse reactions associated with etravirine, an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. However, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury in the sections provided. Nonetheless, some information on hepatobiliary disorders is mentioned, and these can be used to infer potential liver-related adverse reactions.

Clinical trials data (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) indicate that etravirine has been associated with some hepatic adverse reactions. Less common adverse reactions observed in less than 2% of subjects in the clinical trials include hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatic failure, hepatomegaly, cytolytic hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis. Moreover, laboratory abnormalities in treatment-experienced patients showed Grade 2 to Grade 4 increases in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

Among patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus, there were more frequent abnormalities in AST and ALT levels. Grade 2 or higher abnormalities that represented worsening from baseline were reported in 27.8%, 25.0%, and 7.1% of etravirine-treated co-infected subjects for AST, ALT, and total bilirubin, respectively.

The postmarketing experience (Section 6.2) highlights severe hypersensitivity reactions reported with etravirine, including Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and cases of hepatic failure.

Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.1) also warn of severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions, which sometimes feature organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. These cases of hepatic failure could be indicative of severe liver injury.

In conclusion, although acute liver injury as a specific condition is not directly mentioned in the provided sections, there is evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and product warnings that etravirine can be associated with liver-related adverse effects, including hepatitis and hepatic failure, particularly in patients with preexisting liver conditions or co-infections. Therefore, there is a plausible link between etravirine exposure and liver-related adverse reactions, which can potentially include acute liver injury.

Sources of evidence are as follows:
- Clinical Trials (Sections 6.1)
- Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2)
- Warnings and Precautions related to severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions (Sections 5.1)",NA
acute liver injury,everolimus,,"The drug label information provided does not directly list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of everolimus. However, it does mention liver transplantation and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) under Warnings and Precautions (5.5), which indicates that liver-related complications are of concern in the context of everolimus treatment. HAT has been associated with the use of mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus, usually occurring within the first 30 days post-transplant, and can lead to graft loss or death.

The clinical trials experience section for liver transplantation details the adverse reactions observed in an open-label, randomized trial of liver transplant patients exposed to everolimus. The adverse reactions relevant to hepatic issues include abnormal liver function tests, hepatobiliary disorders such as bile duct stenosis, bilirubin increased, cholangitis, cholestasis, and hepatitis (non-infectious). These findings indicate a potential impact of everolimus on liver function, but they do not specifically equate to acute liver injury.

In terms of post-marketing experience (section 6.3), while it’s indicated that various adverse reactions have been identified, including angioedema and pancreatitis, acute liver injury is not explicitly reported here. Nevertheless, given the recognized risks of liver-related adverse events that could potentially lead to severe liver injury, it seems plausible that liver injury could occur as a result of everolimus therapy.

No further details are provided on acute liver injury in the evidence from the drug label itself. Therefore, based on the provided label, there is no direct evidence linking everolimus with acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction. Nonetheless, the risks presented for liver issues suggest that monitoring liver function is essential during everolimus treatment. This is due to the potential for severe liver-related adverse effects, including those that could culminate in acute liver injury. 

For a definitive determination of whether acute liver injury is an adverse reaction of everolimus, additional sources such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports of adverse events, or a review of post-marketing surveillance data beyond the label may provide further evidence. If such information were available, it would need to be reviewed to ascertain the relationship between everolimus and acute liver injury.","NA
"
acute liver injury,everolimus,,"The information provided includes an extensive list of adverse reactions and clinically significant risks associated with the use of everolimus (AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ). However, there is no explicit listing or mention of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction specifically linked to everolimus in the provided drug label sections. Here are the key points summarized from the information based on clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Serious adverse reactions including non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, severe hypersensitivity, and other effects are described, with stomatitis being one of the most common adverse reactions across all indications.
- Laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and increased liver enzymes (AST and ALT) have been noted.
- Renal failure, including acute renal failure, has been reported with its use.
- Deaths due to various causes, including hepatic failure, were noted in the section detailing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) trial (RADIANT-3), though there is no direct attribution to everolimus for the cause of hepatic failure.

Postmarketing Experience:
- Adverse reactions reported during post-approval use of everolimus include hepatitis and hepatic steatosis, among others.
- However, the postmarketing section does not cite acute liver injury directly.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The label warns of various serious conditions including non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, hypersensitivity reactions, angioedema, impaired wound healing, metabolic disorders, myelosuppression, and the potential risk of impaired immune response or infection from vaccinations.
- There are mentions of hepatobiliary disorders (cholecystitis and cholelithiasis), which relate to the liver and gallbladder, in the postmarketing experience section, providing some evidence of everolimus potential effect on hepatic systems.

Box Warnings:
- There is no box warning related to liver injury or hepatotoxicity.

In conclusion, while there is evidence of liver enzyme abnormalities, hepatobiliary disorders like cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, and a single mention of hepatic failure in the context of PNET trials, there is no clear and direct evidence stated in the label that acute liver injury is an identified adverse reaction of everolimus. Additionally, the mention of hepatic failure in the PNET trial does not explicitly link the failure to everolimus. Therefore, while liver-related issues have been reported, the summary does not yield a definitive link between acute liver injury and everolimus based on the available sections of the label. Further investigation into the full clinical trial data, case reports, or expanded post-marketing surveillance data would be required to accurately determine if acute liver injury is truly a potential adverse reaction of everolimus.",NA
acute liver injury,ezetimibe,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatic transaminase elevations) and ezetimibe exposure includes data from clinical trials and post-marketing reports, as detailed in the provided drug label sections.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
1. Monotherapy: In placebo-controlled clinical trials of ezetimibe monotherapy involving 2,396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia, the reported adverse reactions did not specifically list acute liver injury; only upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, arthralgia (joint pain), sinusitis, pain in extremity, fatigue, and influenza were listed as common adverse events occurring at an incidence of ≥2% and greater than placebo.

2. Combination with Statins: In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe with statins (11,308 patients), the incidence of consecutive increased transaminases (≥3 times the upper limit of normal, ULN) was 1.3% in patients receiving ezetimibe with statins compared to 0.4% in patients on statins alone, suggesting a potential relationship between ezetimibe use and liver enzyme elevation.

3. Combination with Fenofibrate: Clinical trials involving the coadministration of ezetimibe and fenofibrate showed clinically important elevations in hepatic transaminase levels (≥3 X ULN, consecutive) at incidence rates of 2.7% for patients treated with both medications, compared to 4.5% for fenofibrate monotherapy, after adjusting for treatment exposure.

Post-Marketing Experience:
Post-marketing reports (which are voluntary and of uncertain frequency) have identified cases of elevations in liver transaminases, hepatitis, cholelithiasis, and cholecystitis associated with the use of ezetimibe, which support the observation from clinical trials that ezetimibe can be associated with hepatic adverse reactions.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label warns of liver enzyme abnormalities with the use of ezetimibe and advises liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated. Increases in serum transaminases have been reported, and there is a recommendation for withdrawal of ezetimibe if elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) of ≥3 X ULN persist.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials showing an increase in liver enzyme elevations in patients treated with ezetimibe, particularly when used in combination with statins or fenofibrate. Post-marketing surveillance has also reported instances of hepatic-related adverse reactions. These findings indicate a potential relationship between ezetimibe use and acute liver injury. Healthcare providers are advised to monitor liver enzyme levels and consider discontinuing ezetimibe if significant liver enzyme abnormalities are detected.",NA
acute liver injury,famciclovir,,"The query requests evidence for the association of acute liver injury with the use of famciclovir. The drug label excerpts provided focus on various adverse reactions and warnings related to famciclovir, but there is no box warning for liver injury associated with its use.

From the provided sections:

1. **Clinical Trial Experience (6.1):** The safety of famciclovir was evaluated across several clinical studies with different patient populations and indications. Within these trials, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse event. The most frequently reported adverse events by more than 10% of adult patients treated with famciclovir in at least one clinical trial included headache and nausea. Selected laboratory abnormalities related to liver function include elevated AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) in a small percentage of patients (2.3% and 3.2%, respectively), which may suggest potential liver enzyme disturbances, but acute liver injury is not explicitly stated.

2. **Postmarketing Experience (6.2):** The section lists adverse events reported during post-approval use of famciclovir. Hepatobiliary disorders reported include abnormal liver function tests and cholestatic jaundice. Although these reports indicate potential liver issues, they do not confirm acute liver injury directly, and the frequency or causal relationship to famciclovir exposure is not established.

3. **Warnings and Precautions (5):** The label discusses acute renal failure, especially in patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher doses relative to their renal function, but there are no warnings related to acute liver injury.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials lists elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), but acute liver injury is not a common reported adverse event in the provided sections of the drug label. Post-marketing data report hepatobiliary disorders, which could potentially include acute liver injury, but specific incidence or causality is not clearly established. Without explicit clinical trial data, case reports, or a specified frequency of acute liver injury, a definitive conclusion about the relationship between famciclovir and acute liver injury cannot be made based on the provided excerpt. Additional data sources, literature reviews, and post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary to further clarify this relationship.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is not listed as an adverse reaction of famciclovir. The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities sections focus mainly on issues like headache, nausea, and renal function disturbances. While hepatobiliary disorders, including abnormal liver function tests and cholestatic jaundice, are mentioned under postmarketing experiences, acute liver injury is not specifically cited. Therefore, there is no provided evidence supporting or refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and famciclovir exposure in these sections. It is important to note that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; thus, a lack of reporting in this label does not definitively rule out the potential for famciclovir to cause acute liver injury. Monitoring and reporting of adverse events should continue to ensure safety."
acute liver injury,famotidine,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and famotidine exposure is as follows:

Clinical Trials (Section 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience):
- Elevated liver enzymes were reported as an adverse reaction in less than 1% of patients during clinical trials. This is indicative of potential liver injury but does not specifically qualify as acute liver injury.

Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience):
- In the post-approval use of famotidine, there have been voluntary reports of more serious liver-related adverse reactions, including cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis. Although these are indicators of liver injury, it is important to note that postmarketing data is less controlled and relies on voluntary reporting, which can make it difficult to determine the actual incidence and establish a definitive causal relationship to famotidine exposure.

No Box Warnings or Specific Warnings (Sections 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS):
- There are no box warnings related to liver injury for famotidine, and the warnings and precautions section does not specifically mention acute liver injury.

In conclusion, there is some evidence of liver-related adverse reactions in the form of elevated liver enzymes in clinical trial data and reports of hepatitis and jaundice in postmarketing surveillance for famotidine. However, the evidence is limited, and no specific data is provided that characterizes these as acute liver injuries, nor is there sufficient information to assess the frequency or establish a clear causal relationship between famotidine and acute liver injury. Therefore, while there is some evidence suggestive of potential liver injury, the extent and nature of this association with famotidine remain unclear based on the provided drug label information. Additional data from more robust studies or detailed case reports would be required to better establish this relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,febuxostat,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and febuxostat exposure comes from both clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials:
In the clinical trials mentioned in section 6.1 of the drug label, liver function abnormalities were reported as an adverse reaction to febuxostat. Specifically, among patients treated with febuxostat, 6.6% of those on the 40 mg dose and 4.6% on the 80 mg dose experienced liver function abnormalities. These rates are significantly higher compared to the placebo group, where only 0.7% experienced similar issues.

The section also states that liver function abnormalities were the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy, accounting for 1.8% of discontinuations in patients treated with the 40 mg dose of febuxostat and 1.2% in patients treated with the 80 mg dose. These values are higher compared to the discontinuation rate due to liver function abnormalities in patients treated with allopurinol, which was 0.9%.

Warnings and Precautions:
In section 5.3, the label warns about cases of both fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat. It also notes that during controlled studies, significant transaminase elevations (greater than three times the upper limit of normal) were observed in febuxostat-treated patients.

Post-marketing Experience:
As detailed in section 6.2, during the post-approval use of febuxostat, adverse reactions of serious liver disorders have emerged. These include reports of hepatic failure (some cases being fatal), jaundice, and elevations in liver function tests. Post-marketing reports are valuable as they can include a larger and more diverse patient population than those in clinical trials. However, it should be noted that these reports are voluntary and the actual frequency of adverse reactions cannot be accurately determined.

In conclusion, there is evidence from both clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance that suggests a relationship between febuxostat exposure and the risk of acute liver injury. The evidence includes increased incidence rates of liver function abnormalities found in clinical trial participants, the severity of these abnormalities leading to medication discontinuation, and reports of hepatic failure in the post-marketing setting. Healthcare providers should monitor liver enzyme levels before and during treatment with febuxostat and manage as recommended in the prescribing information.",NA
acute liver injury,febuxostat,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and exposure to febuxostat (marketed as ULORIC) can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- The drug label indicates that during controlled clinical trials, liver function abnormalities occurred in patients treated with febuxostat. Specifically, abnormalities were noted in 6.6% of patients on a 40 mg daily dose and in 4.6% of patients on an 80 mg daily dose, which were at least 0.5% greater than those experienced by patients on placebo.
- There were instances where these liver function abnormalities led to discontinuation from therapy, with 1.8% of patients on the 40 mg dose and 1.2% on the 80 mg dose discontinuing treatment due to liver function abnormalities, compared to 0.9% on allopurinol.
- Additionally, during these trials, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (2% AST and 3% ALT in patients treated with febuxostat).
- These findings suggest a possible causal relationship between febuxostat use and liver function abnormalities, highlighting the need for monitoring liver enzymes during treatment.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- The drug label also reports postmarketing observations, which include cases of hepatic failure (some fatal), jaundice, and serious cases of abnormal liver function test results, further indicating a potential relationship between liver injury and febuxostat use. However, due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the uncontrolled conditions of postmarketing surveillance, it is difficult to reliably estimate the frequency of these events or establish a definitive causal relationship to the drug.
- The labeling explicitly states that causality cannot be excluded in these postmarketing reports, indicating that there is at least some level of concern regarding the drug's potential to cause liver injury.

Given the evidence from both clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance, there is support for a relationship between febuxostat and acute liver injury. Health professionals are advised to monitor liver function in patients being treated with febuxostat and to consider discontinuation of the drug if liver injury is detected.

The sources of evidence are directly from the drug label sections provided, namely the sections detailing adverse reactions from clinical trials (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience and Table 1) as well as postmarketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), which are customary sections where such information is reported and subject to regulatory review.",NA
acute liver injury,felbamate,1.0,"The relationship between acute liver injury and felbamate exposure is supported by post-marketing surveillance data indicating an association with the use of felbamate. In the ""Warnings"" section of the drug's label, it is noted that evaluation of post-marketing experience suggests that acute liver failure is associated with the use of felbamate. The label cites a reported rate of liver failure leading to death or transplant at about 6 cases per 75,000 patient years of felbamate use (although it acknowledges that this may be an underestimate due to underreporting). 

The details provided in the warning section describe severe cases of liver injury, with about 67% of these reports resulting in death or the need for a liver transplant, typically within five weeks of the onset of symptoms. It was noted that the earliest onset of severe hepatic dysfunction followed by liver failure was three weeks after initiation of felbamate. Furthermore, some cases reported nonspecific prodromal symptoms such as anorexia, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms, while others did not clearly indicate if any prodromal symptoms preceded jaundice.

Aside from the post-marketing reports, the label does not appear to contain specific information from clinical trials regarding the incidence of acute liver injury directly attributable to felbamate. However, it is mentioned that increased liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT) were observed as frequent digestive adverse events in patients exposed to felbamate.

Given this information from the label, particularly from post-marketing surveillance, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and felbamate exposure. The prescribing physician is advised to monitor liver function tests periodically for early detection of hepatic injury and to discontinue the drug if serum transaminases exceed twice the upper limit of normal or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver failure are observed. The label underscores the risk and advocates caution by suggesting that felbamate only be initiated in individuals without active liver disease and with normal baseline serum transaminases.
",NA
acute liver injury,fenofibrate,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, there is evidence to suggest that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction associated with fenofibrate use. This evidence comes from clinical trial data, post-marketing experience, and the drug's warnings and precautions:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: In the adverse reactions section (section 6.1), it is reported that during placebo-controlled trials, there were significant increases in abnormal liver function tests in patients treated with fenofibrate compared to those receiving placebo (7.5% vs. 1.4%). Specifically, there were increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), which are indicators of liver injury. It is noted that these increases may lead to discontinuation of treatment and may be dose-related.

2. Hepatotoxicity Warning: The warnings and precautions section (section 5.2) describes serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI) that has been reported with fenofibrate, which in some cases has necessitated liver transplantation or led to death. The patients exhibited signs and symptoms such as jaundice, which is indicative of significant liver injury. The section advises monitoring liver function tests and discontinuing fenofibrate if signs of liver injury develop.

3. Postmarketing Experience: In postmarketing experience (section 6.2), there have been voluntary reports of adverse reactions such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, although the frequency and causal relationship to fenofibrate exposure are uncertain due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

The evidence from these sections suggests that there is a potential relationship between fenofibrate exposure and the development of acute liver injury. Health care professionals are advised to monitor liver function tests before and during treatment and to discontinue fenofibrate if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop. The information provided does not quantify the risk but indicates that there is a recognized risk of hepatotoxicity associated with fenofibrate use.","NA

The label information provided outlines clear evidence of a potential link between fenofibrate and acute liver injury, listing hepatoxicity as a serious adverse reaction, and including cases of serious drug-induced liver injury reported postmarketing with fenofibrate. Hence, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and fenofibrate exposure in the provided label information."
acute liver injury,fenoprofen,,"The information provided from the drug label sections indicates that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) fenoprofen, which is marketed under the brand name Nalfon. The evidence supporting this relationship includes:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
Clinical trial data is one source of evidence for potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Elevations of liver enzymes, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) three times the upper limit of normal, have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. Less severe elevations (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients. This indicates the potential for fenoprofen to cause liver enzyme elevations, which can be a marker of hepatotoxicity.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label mentions that rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, have been reported with fenoprofen use. These reports are typically sourced from post-marketing surveillance, which tracks adverse events once a drug is released to the general population. Such surveillance can provide valuable information on rare and serious ADRs that may not have been captured during clinical trials.

3. Boxed Warnings and Standard Warnings:
The label issues a standard warning (Warnings and Precautions: 5.3 Hepatotoxicity) to inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, instructing discontinuation of fenoprofen if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.

4. Specific Reports:
While the sections provided do not give specific instances or case studies, the aggregate data from clinical trials along with post-marketing surveillance and the clear warnings regarding hepatotoxicity on the drug label support the relationship between fenoprofen and the potential for acute liver injury. These details fulfill the regulatory requirements of the FDA for disclosing known adverse reactions and are based on cumulative evidence from various sources, including clinical and post-marketing experiences.

In summary, the evidence supporting the association between fenoprofen and acute liver injury is derived from clinical trial data showing liver enzyme elevations, post-marketing reports of severe hepatic injury, and the presence of a standard warning regarding hepatotoxicity on the drug label.","NA  

The provided drug label for Nalfon (fenoprofen) specifically includes hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction under the section ""Warnings and Precautions (5.3)"". It cites occurrences of ALT or AST elevations, and rare cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Therefore, evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and fenoprofen exposure is not applicable, as the relationship is established and acknowledged in the drug labeling."
acute liver injury,ferric carboxymaltose,,"Based on the provided labeling information, acute liver injury does not appear to be listed as a common adverse reaction to ferric carboxymaltose, known by the brand name Injectafer. The adverse reactions section (6.1) lists common adverse reactions from clinical trial data, including nausea, hypertension, flushing, injection site reactions, erythema, hypophosphatemia, and dizziness in adults, and hypophosphatemia, injection site reactions, rash, headache, and vomiting in pediatric patients. ""Hepatic enzyme increased"" is mentioned as an adverse reaction reported by ≥1% of treated patients, which may be an indirect indication of liver function alterations. 

In the table summarizing the findings from the studies included under section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience, ""hepatic enzyme increased"" is mentioned, which suggests that there may be a potential impact on liver enzymes. This could be an indirect indicator of liver function changes; however, this finding does not directly correlate with acute liver injury.

Post-marketing experience (6.2) has identified additional adverse reactions reported voluntarily and hence less reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Among these, liver function test increased is also listed as an adverse reaction that occurred in the post-marketing period. 

While an increase in liver enzymes and liver function test abnormalities can be suggestive of liver injury, the labeling does not provide definitive evidence that directly associates ferric carboxymaltose with acute liver injury. It is important to note that ""increase in hepatic enzyme"" may or may not indicate acute liver injury and that a causal relationship is not firmly established from the above-cited data.

There are no box warnings or specific warnings and precautions listed in the labeling that pertain to liver injury. Hypersensitivity reactions, symptomatic hypophosphatemia, and hypertension are the topics primarily addressed in the Warnings and Precautions section related to ferric carboxymaltose.

Without clear evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or robust post-marketing surveillance directly linking ferric carboxymaltose to acute liver injury specifically, it is not possible to affirm a definite relationship. Healthcare professionals should consider potential liver issues based on individual patient factors and monitor liver function as part of standard care when administering any medication, including Injectafer. If acute liver injury is suspected, it should be reported accordingly as it may contribute to a better understanding of the drug's safety profile through post-marketing surveillance.","NA

The available labeling information for ferric carboxymaltose (Injectafer) does not include acute liver injury as a commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions that are most commonly associated (>2% in adult patients and ≥4% in pediatric patients) with ferric carboxymaltose include nausea, hypertension, flushing, injection site reactions, hypophosphatemia, dizziness, and in pediatric patients also rash, headache, and vomiting. Hepatic enzyme increase is noted (1.2% in adult patients) but this does not specifically equate to acute liver injury. Furthermore, during post-marketing experience, there has been no indication of acute liver injury being reported as an adverse reaction to ferric carboxymaltose.

However, the absence of acute liver injury in these documents does not definitively refute the possibility of this adverse reaction occurring. It may either be extremely rare or not yet identified or reported in the context of the studies and post-marketing surveillance data referenced in the drug's label."
acute liver injury,ferric derisomaltose,,"Based on the provided drug label information for ferric derisomaltose (Monoferric), evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the drug is not explicitly detailed either in the clinical trials or the post-marketing experience sections.

From the clinical trials section (Section 6.1), which discusses the safety of Monoferric evaluated in 3008 patients, there is no mention of acute liver injury being observed. The trials tracked adverse reactions reported in 8.6% (172/2008) of the patients treated with Monoferric, with the most commonly reported adverse reactions being rash (1%) and nausea (1.2%). Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported in a very small number of patients (0.3%), but none of these are described as acute liver injury.

In the post-marketing experience section (Section 6.2), various adverse reactions have been reported; however, they are categorized by body system, such as cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and more. The section does mention “hepatic enzymes increased” under the subcategory of investigations, which can be indicative of liver function alterations, but it does not specify acute liver injury as a particular outcome.

The warnings and precautions section (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), while not mentioning acute liver injury, includes advice against administering Monoferric to patients with iron overload, which highlights the importance of avoiding excessive iron accumulation that could potentially lead to liver damage, among other complications.

In summary, based on the drug label sections provided, there is no documented evidence that explicitly associates acute liver injury with the administration of ferric derisomaltose within clinical trial data or reported post-marketing experiences. Any potential link between the drug and acute liver injury would require further clinical investigation and data analysis to establish causation. Therefore, at this point, acute liver injury should not be characterized as a known adverse reaction to ferric derisomaltose based on the available evidence in the label.",NA
acute liver injury,fexinidazole,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to fexinidazole. Here is a summary of the relevant evidence:

### Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)
In the clinical trial data presented:

- **Population**: A total of 749 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with age ranging from 6 to 73 years, treated with fexinidazole for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to T. brucei gambiense.
- **Exclusions**: Patients with AST/ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal were excluded from the trials, which could indicate a recognition of the potential hepatotoxicity associated with fexinidazole.
- **Adverse Reactions**: Among the list of adverse reactions, there is a specific mention of elevations of liver transaminases (less than 2% of patients aged 15 years and older) which are enzymatic biomarkers for liver injury, indicating cases of hepatotoxicity.

### Warnings and Precautions (5.5)
- **Potential for Hepatotoxicity**: It is recommended to evaluate liver-related laboratory tests at the beginning of and during treatment, suggesting a concern for possible liver damage linked with the use of fexinidazole. This indicates recognition by regulators and manufacturers of hepatotoxicity as a concern.

### Postmarketing Experience (6.2)
- **Metronidazole**: Although the post-marketing experience is regarding another nitroimidazole agent (metronidazole), which is structurally related to fexinidazole, it is included in the label due to reports of severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure associated with metronidazole. This serves as an indirect supportive evidence, given the structural and potentially pharmacological similarities between the two drugs, raising the index of suspicion concerning hepatotoxicity for fexinidazole.

### Summary
In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not reported as a common adverse reaction in fexinidazole-treated patients, the evidence from clinical trials does report less common instances of elevated liver enzymes indicative of potential liver damage. Cautionary language in the warnings and precautions section, and the inclusion of serious hepatotoxic events associated with a structurally similar drug in the postmarketing experience section, further supports the association between fexinidazole and potential hepatotoxicity including acute liver injury. Due to the nature of drug surveillance and reporting, it is important to continuously monitor for updated postmarketing data to more fully characterize the risk of acute liver injury with fexinidazole.",NA
acute liver injury,fidaxomicin,,"Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to fidaxomicin is not explicitly mentioned in the adverse reactions section of the summarized drug label for fidaxomicin (commercially known as DIFICID). To address the specific request for evidence relating liver injury to fidaxomicin use:

In clinical trials involving adults and pediatric patients, the label lists common adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, anemia, neutropenia, pyrexia (fever), and rash. Increased aminotransferases are mentioned as a selected adverse reaction occurring in ≥5% of pediatric patients, which can be an indicator of liver injury. However, the reported data does not explicitly classify these increased liver enzymes as a manifestation of acute liver injury.

Furthermore, in the post-marketing experience, hypersensitivity reactions, such as dyspnea, angioedema, rash, and pruritus, are reported, but no mention of acute liver injury or hepatotoxicity is made. While cases of increased hepatic enzymes are observed, there is not a clear or direct association established with acute liver injury within the provided sections of the drug label.

In terms of safety warnings, the label does not include any specific warnings or boxed warnings pertaining to the risk of acute liver injury.

Since the drug label sections provided do not expressly mention acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction linked to fidaxomicin, and no specific evidence of such a relationship from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance is cited, it can be concluded that there is no evidence within the label information to suggest a direct link between fidaxomicin exposure and acute liver injury. 

Additional data, such as published literature, clinical trial results not included in the label, or detailed post-marketing surveillance reports, would be necessary to further evaluate any suspected relationship between fidaxomicin and acute liver injury. If these additional sources provide evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, they were not provided in the sections of the label summarized above.",NA
acute liver injury,fidaxomicin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to fidaxomicin (marketed as DIFICID). The clinical trial experience detailed in the sections provided indicates that the most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥2% of adult patients treated with DIFICID in controlled trials were anemia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Similarly, for pediatric patients in controlled trials treated with DIFICID, the most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% were pyrexia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, increased aminotransferases, and rash.

While increased aminotransferases (liver enzymes) are listed in the pediatric population as a common adverse reaction, this does not necessarily indicate acute liver injury, which is a more severe condition. Increased aminotransferases could suggest some degree of liver stress or damage but may not reach the threshold of injury that would be clinically classified as acute liver injury.

In the post-marketing experience section, there are reports of increased hepatic enzymes among other more general adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions; however, these are based on voluntary reports, and the frequency or direct causal relationship to the drug exposure cannot be reliably estimated.

In summary, there is no direct evidence provided in these sections of the fidaxomicin drug label that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction associated with its use. It is possible that further research and post-marketing surveillance may provide additional insights into this potential relationship. Health care providers and patients are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to appropriate channels such as the FDA's MedWatch program to help monitor and ensure the safe use of medications.",NA
acute liver injury,fingolimod,,"Acute liver injury is listed as an adverse reaction of fingolimod, which is sold under the brand name Gilenya, used in the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Evidence supporting this is present in both clinical trials data as well as post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials Experience:
In clinical trials, liver transaminase elevations were observed in patients treated with Gilenya. The label indicates that in the placebo-controlled trials, the most frequent adverse reactions for Gilenya 0.5 mg included liver transaminase elevation (15%) notably above the incidence in the placebo group. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation included serum transaminase elevations at a rate of 4.7% compared to 1% on placebo. This indicates a significant increase in hepatic enzyme levels associated with fingolimod exposure.

Postmarketing Experience:
The drug's label mentions that clinically significant liver injury has occurred in the postmarketing setting, and signs of liver injury were noted as early as ten days after the first dose. Liver injury is explicitly listed under ""Hepatobiliary Disorders"" in the drug's adverse reactions postmarketing experience section, demonstrating that these findings are not limited to the controlled conditions of clinical trials and have been observed in the broader patient population after the drug's approval.

Warnings and Precautions:
The label recommends obtaining liver enzyme results before initiating treatment and then periodically during treatment due to the potential for fingolimod to cause liver injury. Clinicians are advised to closely monitor patients, especially those with severe hepatic impairment, and the label suggests discontinuing the drug if significant liver injury is evident without any other cause.

Severity and Reversibility:
The label states that in clinical trials, elevations in liver enzymes were usually reversible after discontinuation of Gilenya, typically occurring within 6 to 9 months of starting treatment. Persistent increases in liver enzymes warranted drug discontinuation.

In summary, the evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to fingolimod comes from clinical trials showing a higher incidence of liver transaminase elevations in users versus placebo, as well as postmarketing reports of significant liver injury. The drug label includes clear warnings and advisories for monitoring liver function and managing potential hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,flecainide,,"The provided drug label information for flecainide includes a variety of potential adverse effects, but acute liver injury is not prominently featured as a common adverse reaction. However, it does mention ""rare reports of hepatic dysfunction including reports of cholestasis and hepatic failure"" observed in foreign post-marketing surveillance studies. The label specifies that these adverse events are rare, and no causal relationship has been established between flecainide exposure and these hepatic events.

It is important to note the following points extracted from the drug label regarding hepatic adverse reactions:

1. Rare instances of hepatic dysfunction, cholestasis, and hepatic failure have been reported.
2. Isolated elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and transaminase levels have been observed. These instances were asymptomatic and not directly linked to flecainide with a cause-effect relationship.
3. It is advisable to discontinue flecainide in patients developing unexplained jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction to rule out the drug as the causative agent, even though a definitive relationship hasn't been established.

In summary, the evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and flecainide exposure is limited and based on rare post-marketing reports without established causality. There is no detailed information provided from clinical trials or case studies that establishes a clear connection between flecainide use and acute liver injury. Therefore, while there is a potential signal for liver-related adverse effects, more rigorous studies would be needed to confirm a direct causal link. Health professionals are encouraged to report any adverse reactions to pharmacovigilance authorities to contribute to the ongoing monitoring of drug safety.","NA

The provided drug label sections for flecainide do not include acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Instead, the label notes rare reports of isolated elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase and serum transaminases, indicating potential mild hepatic dysfunction, but no established cause-and-effect relationship with flecainide. Furthermore, there are rare reports of hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis and hepatic failure, as well as extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias from foreign postmarketing surveillance, but again without establishing a cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, based on this information, there is no substantial evidence to conclusively refute or confirm that acute liver injury is directly related to flecainide exposure. It is advisable to discontinue flecainide in patients who develop unexplained jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction to rule out the drug as the causative agent."
acute liver injury,floxuridine,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions for floxuridine in the drug label sections provided. However, there are indications in the label that liver dysfunction can occur as a result of using floxuridine, which is suggested by the inclusion of elevations in alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminase, and serum bilirubin in the ""Laboratory Abnormalities"" section. These laboratory findings can be indicative of hepatic injury or dysfunction. Additionally, procedural complications related to regional arterial infusion, such as hepatic necrosis and abscesses, point toward potential liver complications, which could feasibly include acute liver injury.

Despite not being directly listed as ""acute liver injury,"" these mentioned adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities suggest that liver impairment can be a side effect of using floxuridine, although it is not clear from the label alone how common such events are or the typical severity. To firmly establish the causal relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to floxuridine, one would typically look for information from clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance reports; however, such specific data is not provided here.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction to floxuridine, the presence of other liver-related adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities indicates that liver dysfunction, including potential acute liver injury, can occur. The evidence to support a direct causality is not provided in the excerpt of the drug label, and additional resources would be needed to further assess the relationship between acute liver injury and floxuridine exposure.",NA
acute liver injury,fluconazole,1.0,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is evidence to suggest that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction associated with fluconazole exposure, though it appears to be rare. Below is a summary of the evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance:

Clinical Trials:
- Hepatic abnormalities, including mild transient elevations in transaminases, have been observed during fluconazole treatment, though the clinical significance and relationship to the drug are uncertain.
- Rare cases of serious hepatic reactions, including hepatitis, cholestasis, and fulminant hepatic failure, have been reported, with instances of fatality noted primarily in patients with serious underlying conditions such as AIDS or cancer.
- Treatment-related liver function test abnormalities led to discontinuation in approximately 1.3% of patients over clinical trials of 7 days or more.
- In trials for cryptococcal meningitis relapse suppression, there was a statistically significant increase in median AST levels, with a rate of serum transaminase elevations over eight times the upper limit of normal being approximately 1%.
- These liver test elevations were more commonly seen in patients with severe underlying disease and in those taking other medications known to be hepatotoxic, such as rifampin, phenytoin, isoniazid, valproic acid, or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Post-marketing experience lists hepato-biliary events including cholestasis and hepatocellular damage but does not provide incidence rates.
- Although rare, there have been reports of serious and potentially fatal hepatic reactions during post-marketing surveillance of fluconazole.
- It has been noted that transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no identifiable risk factors other than drug exposure.

The evidence indicates that while the majority of fluconazole exposure does not result in severe liver injury, there is a potential relationship between fluconazole and adverse hepatic effects. These effects seem to be more pronounced in patients with serious underlying conditions and/or concomitant intake of other hepatotoxic drugs. Given the nature of adverse reaction reporting and post-markarket surveillance, the true incidence and risk factors for such events may be underreported. It is important to monitor liver function in patients taking fluconazole, particularly those at higher risk for liver complications.","NA

The provided drug label sections discuss the occurrence of hepatic reactions, including serious events and transient elevations in liver enzymes, in association with the use of fluconazole. The label explicitly mentions rare cases of serious hepatic reactions and instances of fatal hepatic reactions primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Additionally, there is a mention of elevated serum transaminases in clinical trials. Based on the information provided, there is evidence of a relationship between fluconazole and acute liver injury, rather than evidence refuting it."
acute liver injury,flucytosine,,"Based on the drug label sections provided for Flucytosine Capsules USP, there is evidence that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of flucytosine. The gastrointestinal section of the adverse reactions explicitly mentions ""acute hepatic injury including hepatic necrosis with possible fatal outcome in debilitated patients,"" indicating that liver injury has been observed in the course of treatment with flucytosine. Additionally, it lists ""hepatic dysfunction"" and ""jaundice"" as possible adverse reactions, which further implicates potential liver-related issues.

The warning section underscores the need for caution in patients with impaired renal function and specifies the importance of close monitoring of hematologic, renal, and hepatic status in all patients. This indicates recognition of the risk of hepatic adverse reactions and underlines the necessity of vigilant monitoring for signs of liver injury.

Although the summary of adverse reactions provides a general acknowledgment of the potential for acute liver injury during flucytosine treatment, specifics about the frequency of these events or detailed findings from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance are not included in the text provided. To comprehensively assess the relationship between flucytosine and acute liver injury, a thorough review of additional clinical data, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary.

For a robust evaluation of the strength of the evidence, sources such as peer-reviewed studies, clinical trial data, case reports detailing individual instances of liver injury following flucytosine exposure, and analyses of adverse event databases would be crucial. However, based on the label information given, there is at least some evidence supporting a relationship between flucytosine administration and the risk of acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,fludarabine,,"The provided drug label sections for fludarabine do not explicitly state acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction; however, it does mention hepatobiliary disorders with elevations of hepatic enzyme levels being reported. This suggests there may be some impact on liver function, although acute liver injury is not specified among the most frequent adverse reactions.

Supporting evidence for hepatobiliary adverse reactions includes the following:

1. Clinical Trials Data:
   According to the provided clinical trial data, elevations of hepatic enzyme levels have been reported (Section 6.11). However, there is no mention of clinical trial data specifically indicating acute liver injury. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is an indication of possible hepatobiliary effects, but clinical trial evidence for acute liver injury specifically related to fludarabine is not detailed in the label provided.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   While the drug label includes adverse reactions observed during post-marketing surveillance, it does not provide explicit cases or a clear incidence rate of acute liver injury. Liver-related concerns are generally encompassed under hepatobiliary disorders with abnormal liver function tests being noted (Section 6.11).

3. Case Studies:
   The label does not provide any case studies detailing instances of acute liver injury linked to fludarabine exposure, so there is no case study evidence provided for this specific adverse reaction.

In conclusion, the drug label mentions alterations in liver function tests as a possible adverse reaction to fludarabine, falling under the broader category of hepatobiliary disorders, which could potentially include acute liver injury. However, explicit evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking fludarabine to acute liver injury is not provided in the sections made available. Given the absence of clear reference to acute liver injury, it is possible that such an adverse reaction may be rare or not conclusively established within the data provided. Health professionals may need to refer to additional sources or post-marketing data for more detailed information on the incidence and characterization of acute liver injury associated with fludarabine.",NA
acute liver injury,fluoxetine,,"The provided drug label sections for fluoxetine do not specifically list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or through post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions section primarily details common and treatment-emergent side effects, such as gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea, anorexia), nervous system-related (insomnia, anxiety, somnolence), sexual dysfunction, among others, but does not explicitly mention hepatotoxicity or liver injury.

In terms of warnings and precautions, the drug label does mention rare reports of systemic reactions, which could potentially involve liver injury. However, these seem to be part of broader systemic conditions rather than isolated liver injury cases. Post-marketing experience lists “hepatic failure/necrosis” without a causal relationship established, indicating that there have been reports of severe liver injury, but the frequency or the definitiveness of the relationship between fluoxetine and liver injury remains unclear based on this labeling information alone.

Considering that drug labels include information based on clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, the absence of acute liver injury as a highlighted concern suggests that if such an association exists, it may be rare or not conclusively established. For a definitive assessment of causality, references to scientific studies, case reports, or database analyses, which are not provided in the drug label, would be required. In conclusion, the drug label for fluoxetine does not provide direct evidence supporting a strong or frequent association between fluoxetine use and acute liver injury.

To ascertain the relationship between fluoxetine and acute liver injury, it would be necessary to review additional scientific literature, such as hepatotoxicity case reports related to fluoxetine, population-based studies, or analyses from pharmacovigilance databases, which are not provided within the scope of the drug label information shared.",NA
acute liver injury,fluphenazine,,"Acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of fluphenazine, which is a first-generation antipsychotic medication belonging to the phenothiazine class. The drug label you provided mentions liver damage as one of the adverse reactions of fluphenazine under the ""Hepatic"" section. It specifically mentions that liver damage manifested by cholestatic jaundice may occur, particularly during the first few months of therapy. The recommendation is to discontinue treatment if this occurs.

However, the provided sections do not detail the incidence rates or provide specific clinical trial data related to acute liver injury due to fluphenazine. It is possible that such data might exist in the primary literature or in broader summaries of the drug's safety profile, but it is not explicitly provided in the snippets you presented.

Moreover, the label indicates that there can be an increase in cephalin flocculation, sometimes accompanied by alterations in other liver function tests, in patients receiving fluphenazine hydrochloride without clinical evidence of liver damage. This suggests a monitoring strategy might be indicated to detect liver function abnormalities early in patients taking fluphenazine.

It should be noted that liver damage, including acute injury, is a serious issue and could be life-threatening. Post-marketing surveillance is crucial in identifying and characterizing such adverse reactions, especially since rare or long-term effects may not be detected during pre-approval clinical trials due to their limited duration and sample size.

For healthcare providers and patients, any signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, dark urine, severe fatigue, or abdominal pain, should prompt immediate medical attention and likely discontinuation of the drug. It is also important that healthcare providers follow up with appropriate laboratory tests to monitor liver function in patients taking fluphenazine.

Given the information from the drug label and without additional data, we can assert that there is evidence to support that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction of fluphenazine, and healthcare providers should be aware of this risk and monitor for signs of liver damage during treatment. If additional sources of evidence are available, such as peer-reviewed studies or a complete review of post-marketing surveillance data, they would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the association between fluphenazine and acute liver injury.","NA

The information provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections of the drug label for fluphenazine does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and fluphenazine exposure. In fact, the label explicitly mentions that ""Liver damage as manifested by cholestatic jaundice may be encountered, particularly during the first months of therapy,"" indicating that hepatic issues, including acute liver injury, are recognized as potential adverse reactions to fluphenazine."
acute liver injury,flurbiprofen,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution, which is utilized for ocular conditions, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction within the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings sections of the label. The label does report adverse reactions such as transient burning, stinging upon instillation, ocular irritation, fibrosis, hyphema, miosis, mydriasis, and ocular hyperemia. Also, there is a warning about the increased bleeding tendency of ocular tissues in conjunction with ocular surgery.

Since there is no specific mention of acute liver injury in the supplied labeling information, it suggests that either the complication is not known to be associated based on the data collected for this particular formulation and route of administration or that it has not been a frequently reported or recognized issue.

For a more comprehensive assessment, it would be necessary to consult additional sources such as peer-reviewed clinical trial data, case reports, or larger-scale post-marketing surveillance studies that specifically investigate the relationship between flurbiprofen systemic exposure (often used as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug - NSAID) and acute liver injury.

In the treatment of systemic conditions, NSAIDs including flurbiprofen, in general, have been associated with potential liver-related side effects, although these occurrences tend to be rare. If the question pertains to the systemic use of flurbiprofen, literature and case reports should be consulted to identify any established link between the drug and acute liver injury.

In summary, based on the label information provided for the flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution, there is no indicated evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse effect. Further investigation into additional sources would be required to determine if such a relationship has been established for systemic uses of flurbiprofen.",NA
acute liver injury,flutamide,1.0,"The relationship between acute liver injury and the use of flutamide (Eulexin™) is supported by multiple sources of clinical evidence, including adverse event reporting during clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings issued for the drug.

Clinical Trials:
Evidence from clinical trials does not explicitly highlight acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction during the trial phases. However, adverse experiences related to the liver and biliary system, such as hepatitis and jaundice, were reported as occurring in less than 1% of patients during treatment with Eulexin™ in combination with an LHRH agonist. Laboratory abnormalities related to liver function, like elevated SGOT, SGPT, and bilirubin values, were also reported.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing reports of Eulexin™ have noted more serious hepatic adverse events. These include hospitalization and rare instances of death due to liver failure linked to the drug. Additionally, there have been observed cases of hepatic injuries that were often reversible after discontinuing therapy, although there have been reports of death following severe hepatic injury.

Warnings:
The drug labeling indicates that liver function tests should be performed before starting treatment with Eulexin™ and should not be recommended for patients with ALT levels more than twice the upper limit of normal. It is advised to monitor serum transaminase levels monthly for the first four months of therapy and periodically thereafter. Furthermore, immediate discontinuation of Eulexin™ with close liver function monitoring is recommended if jaundice is observed or if ALT levels rise above twice the upper limit of normal, indicating potential serious liver dysfunction.

These pieces of evidence suggest that there is a significant relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to flutamide, and the risks are serious enough to warrant detailed warnings and monitoring recommendations in the drug's labeling.",NA
acute liver injury,fluvastatin,,"The information provided from the drug labeling includes both clinical trial experience with fluvastatin and real-world post-marketing surveillance. However, while several adverse reactions are listed, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury beside other liver-related events, such as liver enzyme abnormalities, hepatitis, and caution regarding liver function monitoring. 

Clinical Trials:
In clinical studies of adult patients taking fluvastatin, there was a documented increase in liver enzyme levels, which can be an indirect indicator of liver stress or damage. Specifically, the labeling notes that approximately 1.1% of patients treated with fluvastatin developed dose-related, persistent elevations of serum transaminases (which include AST and ALT) to more than three times the upper limit of normal. These persistent elevations can signal liver cell injury and are often used as a surrogate marker for liver injury including acute liver injury.

Post-Marketing Experience:
Though the labeling does not directly correlate fluvastatin with acute liver injury, it does mention various liver-related issues occurring post-market, including hepatitis, hepatic failure, and increased liver enzymes. These types of reports in the post-marketing setting are significant because they reflect real-world usage of the drug outside the controlled conditions of a clinical trial, but they are limited by the spontaneous and voluntary nature of the reporting, which makes it difficult to establish causality or frequency reliably.

In summary, in clinical trials, there is observed evidence of liver enzyme abnormalities associated with fluvastatin use, which can be indicative of liver stress or damage. Post-marketing surveillance has noted cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure, which may include acute liver injury, although these effects are not quantified, and causality is difficult to establish definitively. Patients taking fluvastatin should have their liver enzyme levels monitored, and therapy should be discontinued if significant liver injury is suspected.

Sources of evidence:
- Clinical trial data as reported in the drug labeling.
- Post-marketing reports and observational data as reported in the drug labeling. 

Please note that while acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction to fluvastatin, related liver issues are indicated, and thus there is a suggestion of the potential for acute liver injury to occur, albeit rarely. Always consult the most current label and research data for updates on drug safety profiles.","NA

Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and fluvastatin since the drug label itself lists increases in serum transaminases (liver enzymes) as a potential adverse reaction of the drug. The label also notes that rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including fluvastatin, have occurred. Furthermore, it states that patients with active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations should not use fluvastatin, indicating a recognized potential for liver-related adverse effects. Thus, it would not be accurate to claim that there is evidence refuting a relationship between acute liver injury and fluvastatin exposure."
acute liver injury,fluvoxamine,,"The provided label information for fluvoxamine does not directly list acute liver injury as a commonly observed adverse reaction. Most common adverse reactions of fluvoxamine include nausea, somnolence, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, dyspepsia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, anorexia, tremor, and vomiting, among others mentioned for specific patient populations.

However, in section 6.9 'Postmarketing Reports', there is mention of several adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets that are of unknown causal relationship to the medication due to being voluntarily reported. Among these reactions, hepatitis is listed, which can be associated with acute liver injury. It should be noted that because these reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, it’s challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a clear causal relationship to drug exposure.

No specific clinical trials, case studies, or details from post-marketing surveillance are provided that directly link fluvoxamine exposure to acute liver injury. Therefore, while hepatitis is mentioned as a post-marketing report, there is no conclusive evidence in the provided label that establishes a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between fluvoxamine and acute liver injury. Medical professionals should remain vigilant for signs of liver dysfunction in patients and report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate channels such as the FDA MedWatch program.",NA
acute liver injury,fosfomycin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and laboratory changes, here is a summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and fosfomycin exposure:

Clinical Trials Evidence: 
The clinical trial data provided does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse event for patients treated with fosfomycin. Adverse events reported in more than 1% of the fosfomycin-treated study population include diarrhea, vaginitis, nausea, headache, dizziness, asthenia, and dyspepsia. The less frequent adverse events, which occurred in less than 1% of patients, include increases in SGPT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase), which is an enzyme found in the liver and can indicate liver injury. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned in this clinical trial summary.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence: 
From the post-marketing experience, there are a few serious but rare adverse events that have been reported, including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and angioedema. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatic necrosis are conditions related to liver damage. Although these reports are rare, they suggest a possible relationship between fosfomycin exposure and acute liver injury. However, due to the nature of post-marketing surveillance data, causality cannot be established with certainty.

Laboratory Changes: 
Significant laboratory changes reported without regard to drug relationship include alterations in liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, such as increased SGPT and increased bilirubin. These could be indicative of liver injury; however, the information provided does not specify whether these laboratory changes were associated with clinical manifestations of liver injury or specifically classified as acute liver injury.

Conclusion:
There is some evidence from post-marketing surveillance suggesting a potential association between fosfomycin and acute liver injury, as seen in reports of cholestatic jaundice and hepatic necrosis. Additionally, increased liver enzymes noted in clinical trials could indicate potential liver changes. Nonetheless, these findings are based on rare reports, and a direct causal relationship is not conclusively established through the provided data. Therefore, while there is a suggestion of a possible association with acute liver injury, this is not definitively supported by the clinical trial evidence, and causation should be further investigated through comprehensive studies.",NA
acute liver injury,fosinopril,,"Based on the drug label information provided for fosinopril, a medication used to treat hypertension and heart failure, there is evidence suggesting a potential link between fosinopril exposure and acute liver injury; however, the incidence appears to be low.

Clinical Trials:
During clinical trials, there were reports of elevated transaminases, which are enzymes indicative of liver injury. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In terms of liver function, elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin were observed. These elevations were generally described as mild and transient, and they resolved after discontinuation of therapy. The label indicates that in many cases, these abnormalities were either present at baseline or associated with other factors, but some were possibly related to fosinopril therapy.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
Specific data from post-marketing surveillance regarding acute liver injury and fosinopril is not provided in the provided label information. However, liver-related issues such as hepatitis and hepatomegaly are listed among the gastrointestinal adverse effects that were probably or possibly related to fosinopril in clinical trials.

Case Studies:
No specific case studies are mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label. To evaluate individual instances of acute liver injury potentially associated with fosinopril, scientific literature searches would be required.

Summary:
While acute liver injury is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction to fosinopril, the clinical trials indicated a small percentage of patients experienced liver enzyme elevations that led to discontinuation of the medication. However, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury in the sections provided. It should be noted that such adverse reactions are typically rare and may not be reported in the context of controlled clinical trial data if not frequently observed. If a more detailed evaluation of acute liver injury associated with fosinopril is necessary, it would be advisable to conduct a comprehensive search of the literature including case reports, registry data, and larger-scale epidemiological studies.","NA

Given the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and the use of fosinopril. The label does indicate that elevations of transaminases and other liver function tests have been reported and that fosinopril therapy was discontinued due to serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. Although these elevations were generally mild and transient, this still suggests that liver injury can potentially occur as an adverse reaction to fosinopril. Therefore, it is not accurate to conclusively state that acute liver injury is not related to fosinopril exposure based on this label information.

It is important to consider the entirety of available clinical and post-marketing data to make a comprehensive assessment of drug-related adverse reactions. The presented drug label does not provide data to refute the potential association between fosinopril and liver injury; on the contrary, it indicates that liver abnormalities have been observed in fosinopril-treated patients."
acute liver injury,fosphenytoin,,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Fosphenytoin:**

Acute liver injury is identified as an adverse reaction of fosphenytoin within the provided drug label. Hepatic injury is explicitly mentioned under the Warnings and Precautions (section 5.8), stating that cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin, the active metabolite of fosphenytoin. It points out that these events may occur in isolation or as part of a spectrum of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms). Common manifestations related to hepatic injury include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical outcomes of acute phenytoin-induced hepatotoxicity can range from recovery to fatal outcomes.

The same section further instructs that fosphenytoin should be immediately discontinued if acute hepatotoxicity is observed, indicating a strong advisory based on observed reactions.

The Post-marketing Experience (section 6.2) also acknowledges cases of acute liver injury identified during the post-approval use of fosphenytoin. Albeit such reports are voluntarily submitted and the frequency of occurrence is uncertain, they do establish that there have been instances of acute liver injury related to fosphenytoin or phenytoin use.

**Clinical Trials, Case Studies, and Post-marketing Surveillance:**

1. **Clinical Trials:** Clinical trials' data, as presented in the labeling under section 6.1, mainly discuss the most frequently observed adverse reactions, such as nystagmus, dizziness, pruritus, somnolence, and ataxia. There is no explicit mention of acute liver injury being observed in clinical trials within the provided sections.

2. **Case Studies:** The label does not provide specific case study references for acute liver injury associated with fosphenytoitn. 

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:** Post-marketing surveillance, as noted above, includes reports of acute liver injury and even hepatic failure, signifying a recognized association between the drug and hepatic adverse events.

It should be noted that while post-marketing reports do establish some level of evidence for an association between fosphenytoin and acute liver injury, they are not as robust as controlled clinical trials due to potential reporting biases and lack of confirmatory details. Moreover, the spontaneous nature of reporting means that causality often cannot be established conclusively.

**Conclusion:**
The drug label for fosphenytoin acknowledges acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to the drug, with specific mention in the Warnings and Precautions section. Post-marketing reports further corroborate the existence of this adverse effect. However, the provided evidence in the label does not detail the frequency of this reaction or the specifics of clinical trial observations regarding it.",NA
acute liver injury,fostamatinib,,"The drug label for fostamatinib, marketed as TAVALISSE, identifies hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction and advises monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) during treatment. The following evidence from clinical trials supports the relationship between fostamatinib (TAVALISSE) exposure and acute liver injury:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1 of the label):
   - In placebo-controlled studies, maximum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 9% of patients receiving TAVALISSE.
   - Table 4 in the label delineates the incidence of elevated hepatic transaminases during the placebo-controlled clinical studies, showing:
     - 3% of patients on TAVALISSE had ALT and/or AST elevations greater than three and up to five times the ULN.
     - 5% of patients on TAVALISSE had ALT and/or AST elevations greater than five and up to ten times the ULN.
     - 1% of patients on TAVALISSE had ALT and/or AST elevations equal to or greater than ten times the ULN.
   - The label also notes that for most patients, transaminase levels returned to baseline within two to six weeks of dose modification.

2. Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.2 of the label):
   - The label explicitly warns of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of TAVALISSE and advises monitoring liver function tests monthly during treatment.
   - If ALT or AST levels increase to more than three times the ULN, physicians are advised to manage hepatotoxicity by interrupting fostamatinib therapy, reducing the dosage, or discontinuing the drug.

No specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data are provided within the given label sections. However, the clinical trial data presented in the label demonstrates a quantitative relationship between TAVALISSE exposure and elevations in liver enzymes, which is considered as evidence of possible hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury.

For healthcare professionals and consumers, the label provides a contact mechanism for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions to Rigel Pharmaceuticals or the FDA. Continuous post-marketing surveillance is expected to further elucidate the adverse reaction profile of fostamatinib, including any cases of acute liver injury.

In summary, the clinician-submitted drug label for TAVALISSE indicates hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction, supported by clinical trial data showing an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations in patients treated with the drug. Monitoring of liver function tests is recommended for the management of this risk during treatment with fostamatinib.",NA
acute liver injury,fulvestrant,,"The evidence supporting the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury related to fulvestrant drug exposure includes elevated liver enzymes and hepatic events documented through clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Notably, the drug label sections provided do not specifically mention ""acute liver injury"" as a labeled adverse reaction but do report relevant hepatic-related adverse events.

In clinical trials, the following evidence is pertinent:

1. Increased Hepatic Enzymes: The labeling indicates that more than 15% of patients treated with fulvestrant experienced an increase in hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP). These increases were not dose-dependent and occurred with both the 250 mg and 500 mg dosages. Grade 3-4 liver enzyme increases were reported in 1-2% of patients (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience).

In the FALCON trial (a comparison of fulvestrant 500 mg vs. anastrozole 1 mg), grade 3-4 elevations in ALT and AST were observed in 1-3% of patients treated with fulvestrant (Table 3: Laboratory Abnormalities in FALCON).

2. Dose Adjustments for Hepatic Impairment: The labeling emphasizes the use of a reduced dose of fulvestrant (250 mg) for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, indicating an awareness that fulvestrant exposure can be higher and potentially more harmful in this population (Section 5.2 Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment). 

3. Postmarketing Experience: The label acknowledges that during post-approval use of fulvestrant (section 6.2), hepatotoxicity and liver failure have been reported, although infrequently (less than 1%). 

4. Box Warnings and Precautions: There are no box warnings specific to liver injury-induced by fulvestrant; however, there is a warning related to an increased exposure in patients with hepatic impairment, suggesting that fulvestrant is known to interact with hepatic function.

The evidence from post-marketing surveillance, which although not strictly controlled or always verifiable, includes cases of hepatotoxic events such as hepatitis and liver failure.

In summary, clinical trials have observed an increased incidence of elevated liver enzymes in patients treated with fulvestrant, with some cases reaching Grade 3-4 severity. The product labeling advises a reduced dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reflecting a recognized potential for harm to the liver. Post-marketing reports support these findings with rare cases of hepatotoxicity and liver failure. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly labeled as an adverse reaction. Instead, monitoring for liver-related adverse events is recommended. It is important to note that direct causality between fulvestrant and acute liver injury cannot be established from the information provided, and a healthcare provider should be consulted for individual risk assessment and monitoring plans.","Based on the provided label information, there is evidence that Fulvestrant can lead to increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), which was observed in more than 15% of patients across various clinical trials. The grade 3-4 increases (indicative of more severe liver damage) were observed in 1-2% of patients. However, the data provided in the label does not specifically describe acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. 

Crucially, there is mention of elevated liver enzymes leading to the discontinuation of treatment in a small percentage of patients, and recommendations for a reduced dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. These points suggest caution due to the potential for liver-related adverse effects, but do not directly refute or support the presence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of Fulvestrant. No evidence conclusively refuting the association between fulvestrant and acute liver injury is explicitly provided in the label's sections.

In conclusion, the label information highlights the possibility of liver enzyme elevations, which can be suggestive of hepatic stress, but it does not confirm acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction. Therefore, to definitively refute or confirm the relationship between acute liver injury and Fulvestrant, additional data and clinical studies focused on this specific outcome would be required. The absence of acute liver injury listed explicitly as an adverse reaction in the label information, however, suggests that if it does occur, it may not be a common or well-characterized effect of the drug."
acute liver injury,gabapentin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for gabapentin (marketed as HORIZANT), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The described adverse reactions mainly include effects on driving due to somnolence/sedation and dizziness, increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity, respiratory depression, and various other central nervous system-related adverse reactions.

In the clinical trials experience section (6.1), the safety of HORIZANT was evaluated in over 2,300 patients for conditions such as Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN). For RLS, the most common adverse reactions were somnolence/sedation and dizziness, while for PHN, they were dizziness, somnolence, and headache. Adverse reactions related to liver toxicity or injury are not listed in this section.

Post-marketing experience (6.2) of gabapentin lists breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, and bullous pemphigoid among adverse reactions reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression when gabapentin is taken with opioids or other CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment is also noted. However, acute liver injury is not mentioned as a post-marketing adverse reaction.

Furthermore, the warnings and precautions section (5) does not include liver injury or hepatotoxicity as a concern with gabapentin use.

To conclude, there is no available evidence within the provided sections of the gabapentin drug label that suggests an association between gabapentin exposure and acute liver injury. For confirmation beyond the drug label, one would need to review data from scientific literature, including case reports, case series, or other peer-reviewed studies that might have identified a possible connection between gabapentin and liver injury post marketing.","NA

The provided drug label information for HORIZANT (gabapentin enacarbil) does not include acute liver injury as an observed adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions reported are somnolence/sedation, dizziness, and headache. Other postmarketing adverse reactions mentioned are breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, and bullous pemphigoid. Respiratory depression is noted, especially when taken with CNS depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment. However, acute liver injury is not listed as a known adverse reaction from clinical trials or postmarketing experience. If acute liver injury were associated with gabapentin, it would generally be detailed in the warnings, adverse reactions, or postmarketing experience sections provided its presence was recognized through either clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance, but it is not mentioned in these contexts within the provided sections of the drug label."
acute liver injury,gabapentin,,"The drug label provided for gabapentin does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials. However, under the ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" section, the label notes that hepatobiliary disorders such as jaundice and elevated liver function tests have been identified during postmarketing use of gabapentin. These postmarketing experiences indicate that some patients have experienced liver-related adverse effects following gabapentin use. It is important to note that postmarketing reports are less controlled than clinical trials and can be influenced by various biases, but they do provide insight into rare or delayed adverse events not detected during clinical trials.

The relationship between gabapentin and acute liver injury can be described as follows based on the available information from the label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1): Acute liver injury was not reported as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials for gabapentin included in the drug labeling for postherpetic neuralgia or epilepsy.

2. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2): There have been reports of elevated liver function tests and jaundice, which could be indicative of liver injury. These hepatobiliary disorders suggest a potential relationship between gabapentin and adverse liver effects. However, because these reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to establish a clear frequency or causal relationship between gabapentin and acute liver injury.

In summary, while there is no direct evidence from clinical trials that links gabapentin to acute liver injury, there are postmarketing reports that suggest a potential association. These reports include instances of jaundice and elevated liver function tests, which may point to liver injury occurring after gabapentin exposure. Clinicians should remain vigilant for signs of liver injury in patients taking gabapentin, and patients are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities.",NA
acute liver injury,galantamine,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and galantamine usage is specifically mentioned under the ""Hepatobiliary Disorders"" section in the postmarketing experience subsection of the drug label. Here, hepatitis and increased hepatic enzymes are listed as adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of galantamine hydrobromide. These findings indicate that there have been reports of liver injury following the administration of galantamine. However, because such reports are from voluntary postmarketing surveillance, where the size and characteristics of the population are not well-defined, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of such reactions or to establish a definitive causal relationship between the drug exposure and the adverse event.

It is important to note that the clinical trials (section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) do not mention acute liver injury specifically as a commonly observed adverse reaction; instead, more common adverse reactions included gastrointestinal issues (such as nausea and vomiting), cardiovascular conditions (like bradycardia), and nervous system disorders (such as dizziness and headache).

In conclusion, there is some evidence from postmarketing surveillance that suggests a potential relationship between galantamine use and acute liver injury, evidenced by reports of hepatitis and increased hepatic enzymes. However, the evidence is limited, and no definitive causal relationship can be established due to the nature of voluntary reporting and lack of controlled studies specifically investigating this adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,ganciclovir,,"The provided drug label sections focus on various adverse reactions associated with Ganciclovir; however, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned. Below is a summary of evidence related to hepatic adverse reactions from the presented label information:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
From the clinical trials experience, the listed common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in patients treated with Ganciclovir do not include acute liver injury as a frequent event. Instead, the reported adverse reactions involve hematologic toxicity, renal impairment, gastrointestinal issues, among others (Section 6.1). Elevated hepatic enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) have been reported, which may suggest hepatic stress or injury, but acute liver injury is not specifically mentioned as a common adverse reaction.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
In the postmarketing experience, where adverse reactions have been identified during the broader use of Ganciclovir that were not observed in the clinical trials, hepatic failure and hepatitis are listed under hepatobiliary disorders (Section 6.2). These could be considered severe forms of liver injury, but acute liver injury per se is not specified.

Warnings and Precautions:
The Warnings and Precautions do not specifically list acute liver injury, but they do mention abnormal hepatic function and provide instructions to monitor for hepatic enzyme elevations, possibly as an indicator of liver stress or damage that could precede acute injury (Section 5).

In summary, the drug label for Ganciclovir does not explicitly cite acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction based on clinical trials. However, postmarketing reports have identified cases of hepatic failure and hepatitis, indicating potential severe liver damage. Monitoring for elevated hepatic enzymes as a precaution is recommended in the label. It's important to further investigate individual case studies or the scientific literature for more detailed analysis of acute liver injury instances related to Ganciclovir exposure.

For a more comprehensive evaluation, one would need to examine published case reports, clinical trial data, and other scientific literature that are beyond the scope of the provided label sections.

Please note that this summary is based only on the information available in the provided sections of the drug label, and there may be additional sources or post-marketing data that could provide further evidence.",NA
acute liver injury,gefitinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and gefitinib exposure primarily comes from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials:
In the relevant clinical trials data provided, hepatotoxicity was identified as a potential adverse reaction, where 11.4% of patients had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 7.9% had increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 2.7% had increased bilirubin. Grade 3 or higher liver test abnormalities occurred in 5.1% of cases for ALT, 3.0% for AST, and 0.7% for bilirubin. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity was documented at 0.04%.

The trials specified indicate that these liver function test abnormalities are significant and merit caution. To mitigate the risk of severe liver injury, it is recommended that periodic liver function testing be conducted for patients on gefitinib therapy. Evidence from the clinical trials suggests that patients with liver function test abnormalities should have gefitinib withheld and potentially discontinued if they exhibit severe hepatic impairment.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
The post-marketing experience, although based on voluntary reports and therefore more difficult to quantify, aligns with the clinical trials data in recognizing hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction. However, specific rates or incidences from post-marketing surveillance data are not provided.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials to support the association between gefitinib and the potential for acute liver injury. Monitoring liver function tests is recommended, with the provision to withhold or discontinue gefitinib in cases of Grade 2 or higher ALT and/or AST elevations, or if severe hepatic impairment is present. Although post-marketing reports confirm these findings, the data from this source is less quantifiable. Overall, there is a clear signal that gefitinib can cause hepatotoxicity, though the absolute risk for an individual patient cannot be precisely determined from the provided data.",NA
acute liver injury,gemcitabine,1.0,"The provided drug label sections of gemcitabine reveal that hepatic toxicity, including liver injury, is a recognized adverse reaction associated with its use. Here is a summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between gemcitabine exposure and acute liver injury:

### Clinical Trials Experience

According to the adverse reactions section (6.1) of the label:

- **Single-Agent Gemcitabine Administration**: Among 979 patients treated with gemcitabine, increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were among the most common adverse reactions observed. The label indicates that increased AST occurred in 67% and increased ALT in 68% of the patients. While these laboratory findings suggest hepatic stress, they do not specifically mention acute liver injury as a standalone clinical condition.
- **Combination Chemotherapy**: While the label details several combination therapies involving gemcitabine for different cancers, there is no explicit enumeration of acute liver injury within the provided sections. However, increased liver enzymes were reported as adverse reactions in combination therapies, suggesting hepatic stress in those treatments as well.

### Post-Marketing Experience

Under section 6.2 (Post-Marketing Experience), hepatic failure is listed as an adverse reaction identified during use of gemcitabine post-approval. While the frequency is not provided due to the nature of voluntary reporting, the inclusion of hepatic failure indicates that severe liver injury has been observed in the clinical use of gemcitabine beyond initial clinical trials.

### Warnings and Precautions

Section 5.5 (Hepatic Toxicity) of the label notes that drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported with gemcitabine use alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.

### Source of Evidence

- **Clinical Trial Results**: Provided in the label, showing increased liver enzyme levels in patients treated with gemcitabine.
- **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Mention of hepatic failure, as reported by healthcare professionals and patients in a real-world setting, indicates that gemcitabine exposure has been associated with severe liver injury.
- **Warning and Precaution Notices**: Recognition in the label that gemcitabine can induce liver injury severe enough to potentially lead to liver failure and death.

In conclusion, although the term ""acute liver injury"" is not specifically used, the elevated levels of liver enzymes reported in clinical trials, the recognition of hepatic failure in the post-marketing experience, and explicit warnings about the potential for liver injury—including severe cases—provide evidence of a relationship between gemcitabine exposure and adverse hepatotoxic effects.",NA
acute liver injury,gemfibrozil,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and gemfibrozil exposure can be summarized by examining clinical trial data, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance information mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label – mainly from ""Adverse Reactions,"" ""Warnings,"" and ""Precautions.""

From the **clinical trials** specified in the adverse reactions section of the gemfibrozil label, it is noted that abnormal liver function tests were prevalent. While acute liver injury per se is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions in the provided excerpt, the label does state that hepatoma (a type of liver tumor) and cholestatic jaundice (which indicates liver dysfunction) are probable adverse reactions. Additionally, increased liver transaminases (AST, ALT) were reported, indicating potential liver injury.

In terms of **case reports** and **post-marketing surveillance**, these sources are not directly quoted in the provided label excerpt. Post-marketing surveillance often includes voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and patients, which could potentially have included instances of acute liver injury. However, this specific type of evidence is not detailed in the provided text.

Considering that the label mentions 'abnormal liver function tests' and 'hepatoma' as probable reactions related to gemfibrozil treatment, there is evidence to suggest an association, albeit not quantified in this text, between gemfibrozil and liver-related adverse reactions, which could include acute liver injury as one of the manifestations. It's important to evaluate this alongside current medical literature for a more comprehensive understanding, but based on the provided label sections, a direct statistical association between acute liver injury and gemfibrozil is not clearly established. 

It would be important for healthcare professionals to be cognizant of these potential risks and monitor liver function in patients taking gemfibrozil. This summary would benefit from additional information from the full drug label, as well as from peer-reviewed medical literature and other databases that track adverse drug reactions for more specific evidence regarding acute liver injury associated with gemfibrozil.","NA

Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a refuted adverse reaction in the provided drug label sections for gemfibrozil. Moreover, the label does mention abnormal liver function tests and cholestatic jaundice under the sections where causality with gemfibrozil is probable or has not been established. Thus, there's no supplied evidence to specifically refute the relationship between acute liver injury and gemfibrozil exposure."
acute liver injury,gemtuzumab ozogamicin,,"**Summary of Evidence: Acute Liver Injury and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin**

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
Clinical trials have reported hepatotoxicity associated with the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (MYLOTARG). In the ALFA-0701 adult study, veno-occlusive liver disease (VOD), a severe form of liver injury, occurred in 2% (3/131) of patients treated with MYLOTARG plus chemotherapy during induction and consolidation phases. No VOD events were observed during the consolidation courses solely. The median time to onset of VOD was 9 days, ranging from 2 to 298 days, with 3 fatal events. Notably, VOD was also seen in 2 patients who received MYLOTARG as therapy for relapsed AML in the control arm.

The AAML0531 pediatric study reported VOD in 5% (25/520) of patients receiving MYLOTARG and chemotherapy. VOD was fatal in 2 cases. Additionally, when HSCT was performed in the MYLOTARG treatment arm, VOD occurred within 30 days post-HSCT in 20 (11%) patients.

For monotherapy data, no specific incidence rates for VOD/liver injury were provided for the trials MYLOTARG monotherapy versus best supportive care (AML-19) and MyloFrance-1.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
Post-marketing experience has further corroborated the relationship between MYLOTARG therapy and liver injury, including severe and fatal hepatotoxic events and VOD. These events have been identified through voluntary reports, making it challenging to estimate their frequency reliably. However, they suggest an ongoing concern regarding MYLOTARG's hepatotoxic potential beyond the controlled settings of clinical trials.

**Warnings and Boxed Warnings on the Drug Label:**
The drug label includes a boxed warning for severe or fatal hepatotoxicity, including VOD, linked with MYLOTARG usage. Patients are to be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of VOD. The use of MYLOTARG may necessitate interruption or discontinuation if VOD or severe hepatotoxicity arises.

**Risk Analysis:**
Analysis indicates a higher risk for VOD in patients with previous higher doses of MYLOTARG monotherapy, patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment before receiving MYLOTARG, and those who underwent HSCT either before or after MYLOTARG treatment. The findings highlight the importance of liver function monitoring before and after MYLOTARG dosing, especially around HSCT periods.

**Conclusion:**
Both clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance provide evidence supporting the association between gemtuzumab ozogamicin and acute liver injury, including severe hepatotoxicity and VOD. Warnings and boxed warnings on the drug label reinforce the gravity of the risk and the need for vigilant monitoring.",NA
acute liver injury,gilteritinib,,"Based on the provided label for gilteritinib (XOSPATA), there is evidence to support a relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure from clinical trial data. The safety profile outlined in the label comes from 319 patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were treated with gilteritinib at a dose of 120 mg daily across three clinical trials.

The label mentions that increased transaminase levels, which are indicators of liver injury, were one of the most common non-hematological adverse reactions associated with gilteritinib. Transaminase elevation was observed in 51% of patients at any grade, with 21% experiencing grade ≥3 transaminase increases, which are considered to be severe. Problems related to liver enzymes were also a common reason for dose interruptions (aspartate aminotransferase increased in 6%, alanine aminotransferase increased in 6%) and led to the discontinuation of gilteritinib treatment in about 2% of patients for both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase increases.

In the safety assessment of patients in the ADMIRAL Trial during the first 30 days, elevated transaminases were reported at a frequency of 31% (any grade) and 10% (grade ≥3) among patients pre-selected for high intensity chemotherapy. Similarly, among the patients pre-selected for low intensity chemotherapy, elevated transaminases were reported in 36% (any grade) and 9% (grade ≥3) of cases.

There were no specific mentions of acute liver injury, hepatic failure, or hepatotoxicity beyond transaminase elevations. However, increased transaminase levels can be indicative of liver injury, including the possibility of acute liver injury.

In conclusion, the clinical trial data provided in the label indicate that liver enzyme elevation, which can be a sign of acute liver injury, is a potential adverse reaction of gilteritinib, and requires monitoring and potential intervention. While the information does not detail explicit cases of acute liver injury beyond enzyme alterations, these findings suggest a link between gilteritinib exposure and potential liver injury. No specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data were mentioned in the text provided, so the evidence is primarily derived from clinical trial experiences.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is not specifically mentioned as an adverse reaction to gilteritinib. However, the label does indicate that increased transaminase levels were common, and hepatotoxicity is grouped under ""transaminase increased."" These findings suggest that liver-related adverse effects, which could potentially include acute liver injury, are related to the drug exposure. Therefore, no evidence refuting the relationship between gilteritinib and acute liver injury is available from the provided sections."
acute liver injury,glimepiride,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and glimepiride exposure is not directly mentioned in the commonly reported adverse reactions of glimepiride from clinical trials. In the provided clinical trial experience in Section 6.1 of the drug label, the common adverse reactions include hypoglycemia, headache, nausea, and dizziness, with no specific mention of acute liver injury.

However, the drug label does note that elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed in 1.9% of glimepiride-treated patients in the pooled placebo-controlled trials (compared to 0.8% of placebo-treated patients), which signifies liver enzyme elevations and potential liver dysfunction.

Furthermore, in the postmarketing experience detailed in Section 6.2 of the drug label, ""impairment of liver function (e.g., with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure,"" is listed among adverse reactions that have been identified after the approval and widespread use of the drug. These reports suggest that there have been observations of liver injury, including acute liver injury, although the frequency of such events and the establishment of a causal relationship to glimepiride exposure is uncertain due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the lack of controlled studies specifically investigating this outcome.

In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not among the most common adverse reactions of glimepiride observed in clinical trials, there is postmarketing evidence (voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size) that suggests an association between glimepiride exposure and liver injury, which in some cases, may progress to liver failure. These findings warrant further investigation and caution in clinical practice, particularly in monitoring liver function during treatment with glimepiride.","NA 

Based on the provided drug label sections for glimepiride, acute liver injury is not listed as a reported adverse reaction in clinical trial data nor mentioned in the postmarketing experience. Therefore, per the given request, no additional information is provided. If you need further assistance or a detailed analysis, please let me know."
acute liver injury,glipizide,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label of glipizide, evidence supports that liver injury is a potential adverse effect of glipizide use. However, the level of this evidence is obtained from post-marketing surveillance and not from controlled clinical trials. Below are the specifics:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
In clinical trials involving 580 patients with varying doses of glipizide extended-release tablets, there were no direct reports of acute liver injury being observed. However, mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes such as ALT (alanine transaminase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) were noted, though the relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide was reported as uncertain (Section 6.1).

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
Postmarketing data, which are derived from voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, mention cholestatic and hepatocellular forms of liver injury accompanied by jaundice as adverse reactions identified after approval use of glipizide extended-release tablets (Section 6.2). While this suggests a potential link between glipizide use and liver injury, the spontaneous and voluntary nature of these reports makes it difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causative relationship with glipizide.

**Drug Labeling Warnings:**
The drug label sections provided for adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, nor do they contain a boxed warning specific to liver injury risk. The warnings and precautions provided focus more on the risk of hypoglycemia, hemolytic anemia (particularly in patients with G6PD deficiency), and the potential increased risk of cardiovascular mortality with sulfonylureas, among others (Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3).

In summary, while clinical trials did not directly associate glipizide with acute liver injury, the post-marketing reports suggest that liver injury may be a potential adverse effect. Given that post-marketing reports are less controlled and can be less reliable than clinical trial data, the evidence should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, it is important to consider these findings in the context of glipizide therapy, especially in patients showing signs of liver injury, and to monitor liver function as appropriate.","NA
"
acute liver injury,glyburide,,"The drug label for glyburide indicates that hepatic adverse reactions have been reported, although they appear to be rare. Specifically, the label mentions ""cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progress to liver failure; glyburide tablets should be discontinued if this occurs."" Additionally, there have been reports of ""liver function abnormalities, including isolated transaminase elevations.""

These statements suggest that there is evidence supporting a relationship between glyburide exposure and adverse liver reactions, such as acute liver injury. The nature of these liver adverse reactions can range from benign liver function abnormalities to more severe conditions like hepatitis and liver failure, albeit occurring rarely. This evidence is primarily derived from post-marketing surveillance as is common with rare side effects that may not become apparent during pre-market clinical trials due to a limited number of patients and shorter duration of exposure.

Moreover, the need to discontinue glyburide in the event of liver injury indicates recognition of a potential causal relationship. As these incidents are classified as ""rare,"" the frequency is likely low, but healthcare providers are nonetheless advised to monitor liver function and consider the possibility of glyburide-induced liver injury in relevant clinical scenarios.

The label does not specify the exact incidence of these reactions or provide detailed data from clinical trials or case studies. However, the inclusion in the label reflects historical observations from post-marketing surveillance and possibly individual case reports submitted to the FDA or identified by the manufacturer that have established a sufficient level of concern to warrant the inclusion in the adverse reactions section of the product information.

In conclusion, the evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to glyburide primarily comes from post-marketing surveillance data as noted on the drug label. While the reactions are classified as rare, healthcare providers should be vigilant about monitoring liver function in patients taking glyburide and advise discontinuation of the drug if liver injury develops.",NA
acute liver injury,golimumab,,"The drug label for golimumab (SIMPONI) provides evidence to suggest a potential relationship between golimumab treatment and acute liver injury through elevated liver enzymes. These elevations are considered markers for liver injury or hepatotoxicity.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) through Week 16, it was observed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 0.7% of golimumab-treated patients, compared to 0.2% of control-treated patients. ALT elevations greater than or equal to 3 times ULN occurred in 2% of both golimumab and control-treated patients. During the same clinical trials, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were also reported.

In Phase 2/3 ulcerative colitis (UC) trials, the incidence of ALT elevations greater than or equal to 5 times ULN was approximately 1% for both golimumab-treated patients and placebo-treated patients, with ALT elevations greater than or equal to 3 times ULN occurring in 2.0% of golimumab-treated patients compared to 1.5% of placebo-treated patients.

It's important to note that patients in these trials may have been concurrently taking other medications known to cause liver enzyme elevations, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and methotrexate (MTX), which complicates the direct attribution of liver injury to golimumab.

**Postmarketing Surveillance:**
Postmarketing experience has included reports of severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, in patients receiving TNF blockers, which includes golimumab. However, the frequency of such events is not clearly established due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertain size of the population.

**Conclusion and Sources of Evidence:**
Clinical trials have provided evidence of elevated liver enzymes, an indicator of potential liver injury, in patients treated with golimumab compared to control groups, although the direct relationship with the drug is not conclusively clear due to the influence of other concomitant medications. Additionally, postmarketing data, though less quantifiable, has suggested severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver injury, associated with the use of golimumab.

The information is sourced from the provided sections of the drug label for golimumab, which summarize findings from controlled clinical trials (Section 6.1) and postmarketing experiences (Section 6.3).",NA
acute liver injury,golimumab,,"Based on the provided drug label for golimumab (SIMPONI), the evidence regarding acute liver injury as an adverse reaction can be summarized from the clinical trials and post-marketing experience detailed in the label:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- In controlled Phase 3 trials of golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) through Week 16, elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 0.2% of control-treated patients and 0.7% of golimumab-treated patients. ALT elevations greater than or equal to 3 times ULN were observed in 2% of control-treated patients and 2% of golimumab-treated patients.
- In Phase 2/3 ulcerative colitis (UC) trials, the incidence of ALT elevations greater than or equal to 5 times ULN was similar between golimumab-treated and placebo-treated patients (~1%). ALT elevations greater than or equal to 3 times ULN were observed in 2.0% of golimumab-treated patients compared to 1.5% of placebo-treated patients.

**Post-marketing Experience:**
- The label mentions reports of severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, in patients receiving TNF blockers, which include golimumab.

It is important to note that the label indicates difficulty in establishing a direct relationship between golimumab and liver enzyme elevations due to the fact that many patients in the trials were also taking other medications that can cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDs, methotrexate).

In conclusion, there is evidence suggesting a potential relationship between golimumab and liver injury based on reported increased liver enzyme levels in clinical trial participants and post-marketing surveillance reports of severe hepatic reactions. However, due to the possibility of confounding factors such as concomitant medications, a definitive causal relationship cannot be conclusively determined from the available label information. It is vital for healthcare professionals to monitor liver function tests in patients receiving golimumab and assess patient history and potential contributing factors to hepatic reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,granisetron,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and granisetron exposure can be summarized from the clinical trial data and post-marketing experience as provided in the drug label sections.

Clinical Trials Experience:
In clinical trials involving over 3,000 patients who were administered Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection across a dose range for emetogenic cancer therapies, hepatic adverse events were noted. Specific to hepatic enzyme elevations, the reported frequencies for elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than two times the upper limit of normal were 2.8% and 3.3%, respectively, following the administration of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection. These reported frequencies were not significantly different from those observed in patients receiving comparator drugs such as metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%).

Post-Marketing Experience:
While post-marketing data can provide insight into adverse reactions, it is characterized by voluntary reporting and an uncertain population size, making it difficult to reliably estimate the frequency of reactions or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The provided drug label does not contain specific information regarding post-market reports of acute liver injury related to granisetron.

Other Considerations:
As with many clinical trial assessments and post-marketing surveillance, attributing the cause of liver enzyme elevations directly to granisetron can be challenging due to potential confounding factors. These can include underlying medical conditions, concomitant medications, and the emetogenic cancer therapies themselves. Furthermore, the incidences of elevated hepatic enzymes in trials did not differ significantly from comparators, suggesting that while there might be an association with granisetron, it is not clearly more hepatotoxic than similar antiemetic regimens.

Conclusion:
The summary of the evidence from the provided drug label sections indicates that while there is an observable incidence of hepatic enzyme elevations in patients exposed to granisetron, the evidence to conclusively link granisetron to acute liver injury is not well-established, and no significant difference in the frequency of these elevations was noted compared with comparator drugs in the clinical trials. The drug label does not provide evidence that acute liver injury itself (beyond enzyme elevations) is an adverse reaction specifically associated with granisetron use, nor does it present such findings from post-marketing surveillance data. Therefore, while there is some indication of hepatic enzyme changes, there is insufficient evidence in the provided sections to support a definitive relationship between acute liver injury and granisetron exposure.
",NA
acute liver injury,griseofulvin,0.0,"The relationship between acute liver injury and griseofulvin exposure can be inferred from information within the drug label itself, specifically from post-marketing reports and the WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections.

According to the provided drug label sections, hepatic adverse events post-marketing have been associated with the use of griseofulvin. These hepatic adverse events presumably include acute liver injury since the label mentions hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be consequences or indicators of severe liver damage. Furthermore, the label advises that griseofulvin administration should be discontinued if hepatitis occurs, which further suggests a recognition of the potential relationship between griseofulvin use and liver injury.

The evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction is primarily from post-marketing surveillance, as seen from the provided text. This type of surveillance typically involves the collection of reports from healthcare providers, patients, and pharmaceutical companies after a drug has been approved and is in widespread use.

While no specific clinical trials are mentioned in the provided text, the accumulated data from post-marketing reports serve as a basis for recognizing the risk of liver injury. Clinical trials may have reported other side effects, but for the question at hand, the relevant evidence comes from post-marketing surveillance that has identified hepatic adverse events.

To accurately determine the frequency and establish a causal relationship between griseofulvin and acute liver injury, more detailed analyses of post-marketing data, case studies, and potentially further clinical trials would be required. Healthcare providers and patients are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions, which can be used to update the drug's safety profile.

In summary, based on the provided drug label information, there is evidence from post-marking surveillance that suggests a relationship between acute liver injury and griseofulvin use. The drug label mentions hepatitis and altered liver function indicators (elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia) which supports the relationship between griseofulvin and liver injury. However, detailed information regarding the frequency of this adverse reaction or the strength of the causal relationship is not provided in the text.",NA
acute liver injury,guanfacine,,"Based on the information provided, the relationship between acute liver injury and guanfacine exposure is not explicitly mentioned in the cited drug label sections. However, the ""LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM"" subsection under ""Postmarketing Experience"" does report ""abnormal liver function tests"" among the possible guanfacine-related events observed in the postmarketing study and/or spontaneously reported.

Although abnormal liver function tests can be an indicator of liver injury, these test results are non-specific and can occur due to many different etiologies. Since the summary of the ""Postmarketing Experience"" does not discuss acute liver injury directly, but mentions abnormal liver function tests, the evidence to support a definitive relationship between acute liver injury and guanfacine exposure remains insufficient within this document. There is no detail on the severity, frequency, or the clinical significance of these abnormal test results, and thus the evidence available here does not allow for a clear association specifically with acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to guanfacine.

To establish a relationship between guanfacine and acute liver injury, more detailed data including case reports with causality assessment, clinical trial data with liver-specific outcomes, and further epidemiological studies would be required to demonstrate incidence, causality, and pattern of liver injury. This evidence is not provided in the sections of the drug label that have been shared.

Therefore, based on the available information from the drug label, there is mention of abnormal liver function tests as a potential adverse effect post-marketing, but no conclusive evidence is available to support a direct relationship between guanfacine and acute liver injury. For a more accurate and comprehensive assessment, additional data sources and research would need to be reviewed.","NA

Based on the provided sections from the drug label, acute liver injury is not listed as an observed adverse reaction associated with guanfacine. The sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience do mention ""abnormal liver function tests"" under the heading ""LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM,"" but there is no specific mention of acute liver injury as a direct adverse reaction. It's also important to note that such abnormal liver function tests do not necessarily indicate acute liver injury, and the label does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between guanfacine and these liver function test abnormalities. Therefore, considering the evidence provided in the drug label, there is no disclosed evidence to support a refutation of the relationship between acute liver injury and guanfacine."
acute liver injury,haloperidol,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label regarding haloperidol, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between haloperidol and various adverse reactions; however, *acute liver injury* specifically is not extensively detailed within this summary of the label. 

The section titled ""Liver Effects"" does note that ""Impaired liver function and/or jaundice have been reported."" While this statement indicates that some liver-related adverse events have occurred, the summary is not explicit about the frequency or definitive causality related to haloperidol use. It also doesn't specify whether the reported liver impairment constitutes ""acute liver injury,"" which medically refers to the sudden loss of liver function in a person without pre-existing liver disease.

Since acute liver injury is a severe condition and the evidence as per the label is limited to jaundice and impaired liver function without significant detail, there is likely insufficient evidence to robustly confirm a direct and consistent causal relationship between haloperidol and acute liver injury based strictly on the label information.

To provide a more thorough evaluation, one would need to review additional sources such as published clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports that may offer more detailed insights into the incidence of acute liver injury in patients taking haloperidol. This would help to determine the frequency of such events and whether there is a higher incidence in patients using haloperidol compared to the general population or to patients using other antipsychotics.

Therefore, while the drug label hints at possible liver-related side effects, it does not offer clear and detailed evidence to confirm a strong association between acute liver injury and haloperidol use, necessitating further investigation for robust conclusions.",NA
acute liver injury,hydromorphone,,"The drug label provided for hydromorphone does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. It does, however, mention several potential side effects related to other systems of the body. In the hepatobiliary disorders category, the drug label references ""biliary colic"" but does not mention acute liver injury or hepatotoxicity explicitly. 

Clinical Trials Evidence:
There is no information provided from clinical trials specifically regarding the incidence of acute liver injury due to hydromorphone use.

Case Studies:
The provided drug label does not reference any case studies related to acute liver injury resulting from the use of hydromorphone.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
From the post-marketing reports listed in the drug label, adverse reactions have been identified, yet it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary nature of these reports. There is no direct reference to acute liver injury as part of these post-marketing adverse reactions.

Conclusion:
Based on the information provided in the drug label sections for hydromorphone, there is no explicitly stated evidence linking hydromorphone use to acute liver injury. Adverse reactions are noted in various bodily systems, and while hepatobiliary disorders are mentioned, they do not specifically include acute liver injury. Please note that the absence of a mention in the drug label does not conclusively prove that there is no risk; it simply indicates that such a reaction has not been sufficiently documented or established as directly associated with the drug based on the available data in clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance up to the knowledge cutoff date.

For the most accurate assessment, healthcare professionals would need to rely on the latest medical literature, clinical experience, and reporting through systems like the FDA's MedWatch for any additional evidence that might have emerged beyond the scope of the provided drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,hydroxychloroquine,,"Evidence for the adverse reaction of acute liver injury related to hydroxychloroquine comes from clinical experience during post-marketing surveillance and reports of adverse drug reactions. The hepatobiliary disorders section of the drug label mentions ""abnormal liver function tests"" and ""fulminant hepatic failure,"" indicating that there have been instances where liver function abnormalities were observed after the administration of hydroxychloroquine. These adverse reactions, however, are reported voluntarily from a population size that is uncertain, making it challenging to establish the frequency or a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

Specifically, within the warnings and precautions section (5.5), there is a clear mention of hepatotoxicity associated with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Cases have been reported where hydroxychloroquine was used in patients with PCT, showing significant elevations in transaminases, sometimes exceeding 20 times the upper limit of the reference range within days to a month of initiating hydroxychloroquine. Although these cases occasionally had other contributing factors for liver injury, such as alcohol use or other hepatotoxic medications, the association with hydroxychloroquine suggests a potential risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury.

The evidence does not come from controlled clinical trials but rather from observations in clinical practice and reports collected after the drug was approved and widely used (post-marketing surveillance). The label advises monitoring liver tests in patients who present symptoms indicative of liver injury and suggests discontinuing hydroxychloroquine if there is evidence of significant liver enzyme elevations.

In summary, while randomized controlled trials do not specifically document acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine, post-marketing data and case reports suggest a potential association. It is important to monitor liver function in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, especially in those with underlying hepatic conditions or concurrent risk factors for liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,hydroxyurea,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to suggest that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction associated with hydroxyurea exposure. Specifically, under Section 6.1 Postmarketing Experience, it is reported that hepatobiliary disorders, including elevation of hepatic enzymes, cholestasis, and hepatitis, have been identified during post-approval use of hydroxyurea capsules. These reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, and while the exact frequency cannot be reliably estimated, their occurrence signals a possible relationship between hydroxyurea exposure and hepatitis, which is a form of acute liver injury.

Additionally, Section 5.6 Warnings and Precautions mentions hepatotoxicity as a potential risk when hydroxyurea is used concomitantly with certain antiretroviral drugs in patients with HIV infection. Hepatotoxicity is a broad term referring to liver damage, and it reinforces the concern that hydroxyurea may contribute to liver injury under specific circumstances.

While the drug label does not provide detailed information from clinical trials specifically regarding acute liver injury, the postmarketing surveillance data and the safety warnings in the label suggest a recognized association between hydroxyurea use and adverse hepatic effects. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver function in patients on hydroxyurea and to consider these risks when prescribing the medication. It is important to note that adverse reactions reported in postmarketing experience do not establish a causal relationship but warrant further investigation and clinical awareness.

These sources, comprised of the drug label warnings, precautions, and postmarketing experiences, serve as the foundation for associating hydroxyurea with the potential risk of acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,ibrutinib,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing experience of patients treated with ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA) as noted in the provided drug label sections.

Specifically, the adverse reactions section (6) of the drug label lists various clinically significant side effects experienced by patients with B-cell malignancies and adult or pediatric patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), including hematologic toxicities, gastrointestinal symptoms, and infections, among others. No mention of acute liver injury is found in these sections.

In the warnings and precautions section (5), there are cautions about the risk of hemorrhage, infections, cardiac conditions, hypertension, cytopenias, second primary malignancies, tumor lysis syndrome, and embryo-fetal toxicity. However, there is no specific warning or precaution related to liver injury.

Finally, the post-marketing experience section (6.2) includes additional adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of IMBRUVICA, including hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatic failure and hepatic cirrhosis, but acute liver injury is not explicitly stated.

Given the provided sections of the drug label, it can be concluded that there is no known evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance included in the label that directly associates acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to ibrutinib. However, hepatic failure and hepatic cirrhosis are mentioned as hepatobiliary disorders identified in the post-marketing experience, indicating that liver-related adverse events have been reported, albeit not characterized specifically as acute liver injury in the provided text. Always refer to the most current prescribing information and drug label for comprehensive safety information.",NA
acute liver injury,ibuprofen,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ibuprofen use includes reported side effects from clinical trials, post-marketing experiences, and qualification under probable causal relationship classifications. Based on the label sections provided, ibuprofen has been associated with hepatotoxic effects such as hepatitis, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests. These hepatic adverse reactions are listed as probable causal relationships, although with an unknown precise incidence that is less than 1%. This classification implies that there has been either one positive rechallenge or at least three cases that might be causally related to ibuprofen. 

Furthermore, the ""Probable Causal Relationship"" criteria suggest a structured evaluation with a certain number of reported cases to include an adverse event in this category. Acute liver injury is therefore recognized as a potential adverse reaction to ibuprofen but with a lower incidence compared to gastrointestinal and other frequent adverse effects.

However, it is crucial to note that the exact incidence of hepatotoxicity related to ibuprofen is not specified among the adverse reactions occurring during clinical trials at an incidence greater than 1%. The more common GI side effects such as nausea and dyspepsia are clearly explicited, which indicates that liver injury is a less frequently observed outcome during ibuprofen use.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not among the most common adverse reactions to ibuprofen, evidence of its occurrence comes from clinical observation and post-marketing surveillance listed in the drug's label, demonstrating that there is a recognized, though rare, risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the drug. Cases may be underreported due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing surveillance reporting systems, and the true incidence may be difficult to determine. However, the inclusion of liver-related adverse reactions in the drug labeling reflects regulatory agencies' acknowledgment of the evidence supporting a relationship between ibuprofen exposure and hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,idelalisib,,"Evidence linking acute liver injury to idelalisib exposure predominantly originates from clinical trials, with further case studies and post-marketing surveillance providing additional insight.

Clinical Trials:
Clinical trial data suggest a link between idelalisib (Zydelig) and hepatotoxicity. As noted in the provided drug label:

1. In study sections 6.1 and 5.1, it is indicated that *fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity occurred in 16%* of patients treated with idelalisib, with some cases leading to discontinuation or dose adjustments of the drug. These adverse events primarily occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment.

2. Laboratory findings also support the association, with *ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) increases* observed in patients taking idelalisib as reported in Table 3 of section 6.1, reflecting liver enzyme elevations which are indicative of liver injury.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
According to section 6.2 of the provided label, hepatotoxicity has been identified during post-approval use of Zydelig. This confirms that the occurrence of liver injury is not confined to controlled clinical trial settings, underscoring real-world evidence for this adverse reaction.

The drug label highlights that providers should actively monitor liver function prior to and during treatment with idelalisib and that the drug should be discontinued or adjusted in case of liver enzyme elevations.

In conclusion, the evidence tying acute liver injury to idelalisib stems from clinical studies where a notable percentage of patients experienced serious hepatotoxicity, augmented by laboratory findings indicative of liver injury and supported by post-marketing reports. Continual monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended during treatment with idelalisib, and measures should be in place to mitigate the risk of severe liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,idelalisib,,"Acute liver injury has been recognized as a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of idelalisib (Zydelig). The available evidence for its hepatotoxic effects comes from clinical trials results, post-marketing experience, as well as the drug's warnings and precautions sections as detailed in the prescribing information.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
Idelalisib exposure has been associated with serious hepatotoxicity in clinical trials. Data from the Zydelig clinical trials showed that fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity occurred in 16% of patients when combined with rituximab or with other unapproved combination therapies. Liver enzyme elevations (ALT and AST) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed, with hepatotoxicity typically appearing within the first 12 weeks of treatment. Upon dose interruption, the hepatotoxicity was generally reversible. However, upon rechallenge or dose reduction, 26% of patients experienced recurrence of elevated liver transaminases (ALT and AST elevations). Several patients required discontinuation of Zydelig due to hepatotoxicity.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
Post-marketing reports indicate instances of hepatotoxicity, suggesting that hepatotoxic events may occur in clinical use subsequent to the completion of clinical trials. However, because these reports are voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal link to idelalisib exposure.

**Drug Label Warnings:**
The drug label for idelalisib includes hepatitis under Warnings and Precautions, emphasizing the need to monitor hepatic function prior to and during treatment. The label mandates monitoring liver enzymes every two weeks for the first three months, every four weeks for the next three months, and then periodically thereafter. In cases where hepatic enzymes rise notably, monitoring frequency should increase, with potential interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of dosage depending on the severity of liver enzyme elevations.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials indicates a risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, with the use of idelalisib. Post-marketing reports corroborate these findings, and the drug label contains explicit warnings of the risk of hepatitis. These sources establish a clear link between idelalisib exposure and acute liver injury. It is therefore crucial for healthcare providers to monitor liver function tests in patients receiving idelalisib and manage hepatotoxicity as recommended in the prescribing information.",NA
acute liver injury,ifosfamide,,"Evidence of Acute Liver Injury from Ifosfamide:

Clinical Trials:
Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction from ifosfamide can be gleaned from the section titled ""HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS"" in the provided label information. This section reports hepatotoxicity as outlined by elevations in various liver enzymes (serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), increased bilirubin, jaundice, and hepatorenal syndrome with a frequency of 1.8% (22/1190) among patients in clinical trials. Although the incidents are relatively low compared to other adverse reactions, they suggest that ifosfamide can lead to liver-related adverse effects, indicating a potential for acute liver injury.

Case Studies:
The provided drug label does not mention specific case studies detailing instances of acute liver injury. Case studies can serve as crucial sources of evidence for rare or serious adverse drug reactions not commonly seen in clinical trials due to limited sample size and short-term follow up. However, in this instance, we do not have data from individual case studies.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
In the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section, there is an indication of severe adverse reactions reported after the approval of the drug, including hepatobiliary disorders like hepatic failure, hepatitis fulminant, veno-occlusive liver
disease, portal vein thrombosis, cytolytic hepatitis, and cholestasis. While these are listed under the broader category of ""HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS,"" they provide post-marketing evidence that ifosfamide exposure can lead to severe liver injury. Due to the nature of post-marketing surveillance, the frequency of these reactions is often not well-established, and a causal relationship to drug exposure is more challenging to confirm as this data relies on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size.

In summary, clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance from the drug label indicate that ifosfamide treatment is associated with hepatotoxic effects, which could encompass acute liver injury. The documentation of increased liver enzymes, jaundice, and hepatorenal syndrome in clinical trials, along with post-marketing reports of hepatic failure and other serious liver disorders, supports the relationship between ifosfamide exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, although the precise incidence and causal relationship are less clear outside of controlled study environments.",NA
acute liver injury,imatinib,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and imatinib exposure is documented both in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to imatinib is included under the section of ""Warnings and Precautions"" in the label, specifically under ""5.4 Hepatotoxicity,"" indicating that hepatotoxicity, including severe cases, may occur with imatinib. The label advises the monitoring of liver function (transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) before treatment initiation and monthly thereafter. Furthermore, the section outlines that cases of fatal liver failure and severe liver injury requiring liver transplants have been reported with both short-term and long-term use of imatinib. 

Tables of adverse reactions from clinical trial data (such as Table 4 and Table 6) show incidents of elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, which are indicators of liver injury. For example, in Table 7, under ""Biochemistry Parameters"" for patients with myeloid blast crisis, accelerated phase, and chronic phase after interferon-alpha therapy, hepatic toxicity—including instances of Grade 3/4 elevation of transaminases and bilirubin—is reported. This implies that liver injury has been observed during clinical trials at different phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment with imatinib.

Additionally, post-marketing experience (Section 6.2) also provides real-world evidence of hepatotoxicity associated with imatinib. Here, severe cases have been reported, comprising liver function abnormalities severe enough to require liver transplants. The information specifies that there have been reports of acute liver failure and severe liver injury, indicating a clear relationship between imatinib and potential significant liver damage in the post-marketing phase.

In summary, evidence supporting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to imatinib includes documented cases from clinical trials, post-marketing reports of severe liver injury, and explicit cautions in the drug's labeling about the risk of hepatotoxicity. Liver function monitoring is recommended before and during treatment as a safety measure to manage this identified risk.",NA
acute liver injury,indapamide,,"The information provided in the label does not explicitly include acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction associated with the use of indapamide based on the controlled clinical trials listed. The adverse reactions reported with a cumulative incidence equal to or greater than 5% do not mention liver injury or associated symptoms. However, post-marketing experience and clinical usage reports, detailed beyond the context of controlled trials, do indicate infrequent instances of hepatic-related adverse reactions such as jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), hepatitis, and abnormal liver function tests. These hepatic events have been reported to be reversible upon discontinuation of indapamide, suggesting a relationship between the drug exposure and these hepatic events.

In summary, routine clinical trials of indapamide at doses of 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg for periods of 6 to 8 weeks and up to 40 weeks did not report acute liver injury as a frequent adverse reaction. However, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance and clinical usage that suggests a possible causal relationship between indapamide and acute liver injury, as indicated by reported cases of jaundice, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, which are reversible with the discontinuation of indapamide treatment. These reports are less structured than controlled trials and are based on clinical observations, patient reporting, and physician submissions to drug surveillance databases, so the frequency and causality are less defined. No information is provided regarding the incidence rate of these hepatic-related events in the population taking indapamide.

Upon assessing this evidence, it is important for clinicians to be aware of these potential hepatobiliary adverse reactions and monitor patient liver function as indicated, particularly in patients who may be at increased risk for such reactions or who present with symptoms suggestive of liver injury while taking indapamide. It is also crucial for healthcare providers to report any such adverse reactions to appropriate drug surveillance systems to improve the understanding of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute liver injury,indinavir,,"**Evidence Summary for Indinavir-associated Acute Liver Injury:**

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In clinical trials for Indinavir (marketed as CRIXIVAN), there are reports of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin ≥2.5 mg/dL), with incidence at approximately 14% of patients treated. This condition, characterized predominantly by elevated indirect bilirubin, implies potential liver involvement. However, less than 1% of these cases were associated with elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are more direct markers of liver injury.

**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
Post-marketing experience with Indinavir has documented liver function abnormalities and hepatitis, which could include acute liver injury. There have also been reports of hepatic failure, albeit without detailed incidence rates or a clear causality link established to Indinavir exposure.

**Box Warnings, Warnings, and Post-Marketing Experience Sections:**
While the label warnings primarily emphasize nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis and associated renal risks, liver function abnormalities and hepatitis are listed as potential adverse reactions to be aware of during Indinavir treatment. The label also includes warnings for fat redistribution, hyperglycemia, increased bleeding in patients with hemophilia, and hemolytic anemia, but it does not prominently highlight liver injury as a boxed warning.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggest a possible relationship between Indinavir and liver-related adverse reactions, such as asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia and liver function abnormalities. There are reports of hepatitis and hepatic failure, though these are less common. The connection to acute liver injury specifically is implied but not thoroughly quantified or characterized within the provided data; thus, causality is suggested but not conclusively established. Healthcare providers should monitor liver enzymes and overall liver function in patients receiving Indinavir, especially considering these potential risks.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for indinavir (CRIXIVAN), acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction, hence there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and indinavir exposure because acute liver injury is not claimed as a known adverse reaction. The label does mention liver function abnormalities and hepatitis (which can include hepatic failure) in the Post-Marketing Experience section, and these conditions are associated with liver injury. However, no specific evidence is presented in the label that would serve to refute a relationship between acute liver injury and the drug.

It should be noted that the lack of mention in the label does not conclusively prove the absence of a potential adverse reaction—only that it has not been recognized or reported in the context of the provided label information. Post-marketing surveillance and further studies would be needed for a comprehensive assessment of all potential adverse reactions."
acute liver injury,indomethacin,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for indomethacin, there is evidence that hepatotoxicity, which includes acute liver injury, is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of this medication. The specific evidence for indomethacin-related acute liver injury is detailed in the Warnings and Precautions (5.3) section of the drug label, which describes the following:

1. Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing Experience: Elevations of liver enzymes (ALT or AST) three or more times the upper limit of normal have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials. Additionally, rare cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, have been reported. These are of particular concern due to the potential severity and, in some cases, fatalities.

2. Monitoring Recommendations: The drug label advises monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, or right upper quadrant tenderness. Indomethacin should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations appear.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: Post-marketing reports have indicated cases of toxic hepatitis and jaundice, some of which were fatal, suggesting a causal relationship between indomethacin and acute liver injury.

The evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance underscores the fact that acute liver injury can occur with indomethacin use, although the incidence seems to be low. The data from clinical practice as detailed on the label points, albeit rarely, to the occurrence of severe liver reactions, including fatal cases. The drug label's emphasis on monitoring liver function tests and the inclusion of hepatotoxicity under Warnings and Precautions, fortifies the association between indomethacin use and the risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury.

Physicians prescribing indomethacin are cautioned to be vigilant for signs of liver dysfunction and to discontinue the therapy if such signs are evident, reiterating the recognized risk of liver-related adverse effects associated with this drug.","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, Acute liver injury is listed as an adverse reaction (Hepatotoxicity) under 'Warnings and Precautions (5.3)' for indomethacin. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and indomethacin administration in this context. The label specifically warns about the signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and advises discontinuation of indomethacin if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop."
acute liver injury,infliximab,1.0,"The evidence indicating a relationship between acute liver injury and infliximab exposure comes from several sources as detailed in the drug label provided.

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: Infliximab has been exposed to thousands of adult patients across various indications (RA, CD, AS, PsA, UC, Ps). Hepatotoxicity, including severe liver injury, acute liver failure, and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving infliximab. Although details on the incidence rate are not provided, the label explicitly mentions these severe adverse reactions.

2. **Postmarketing Experience**: Severe hepatic reactions such as acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis have been reported in the postmarketing setting, indicating that these events were identified once the drug was used in the broader patient population outside of clinical trials. These cases have included both fatal outcomes and some requiring liver transplantation.

3. **Laboratory Abnormalities in Clinical Trials**: ALT and AST elevations were observed more frequently in patients receiving infliximab compared to controls. The liver enzyme elevations were generally asymptomatic and resolved or decreased with the continuation or discontinuation of infliximab or modification of concomitant medications. The label presents a detailed table (Table 1) that shows differences in the proportion of patients with elevated ALT between those treated with infliximab and placebo across indications.

4. **Risk Management and Monitoring Recommendations**: The label contains warnings about the risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation and the need for testing prior to initiation of infliximab therapy. For patients with hepatitis B, close monitoring and possible initiation of antiviral therapy are recommended, highlighting the recognition of potential hepatic risks associated with infliximab.

5. **General Warnings and Precautions**: The label advises caution and monitoring for patients who develop symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction and recommends discontinuation of the drug if jaundice and/or significant liver enzyme elevations develop.

6. **Boxed Warnings and Contraindications**: While the boxed warnings prominently highlight serious infections and malignancy, they do not specifically address acute liver injury. However, the contraindications and warnings sections of the label cite the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe heart failure, where there is an increased occurrence of serious adverse reactions, including hospitalizations for worsening heart failure at higher doses (10 mg/kg).

In summary, the drug label for infliximab provides evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction to the drug. This is derived from clinical trial data, postmarketing surveillance reports, laboratory abnormalities observed during clinical trials, and the guidance provided for the management and monitoring of hepatic risks. The evidence suggests that while acute liver injury is not the most common adverse reaction, it is a serious concern that requires caution and careful monitoring.",NA
acute liver injury,inotersen,,"Evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to inotersen (marketed as TEGSEDI), an antisense oligonucleotide drug used for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) with polyneuropathy, is found in the provided drug label sections, specifically in section 5.6 ""Liver Injury.""

Clinical Trial Evidence:
The drug label states that in clinical trials, an increased level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a liver enzyme indicative of liver injury, occurred in 8% of TEGSEDI-treated patients, which was greater than the 3% observed in placebo-treated patients. Moreover, 3% of TEGSEDI-treated patients had ALT levels at least eight times the upper limit of normal (ULN), while no placebo-treated patients reached this level.

Case Reports:
The label mentions a specific clinical trial patient who experienced a greatly increased ALT more than 30 times the ULN. This patient showed normalization of ALT levels after cessation of TEGSEDI and a course of corticosteroids.
Additional cases mentioned include suspected immune-mediated biliary diseases in TEGSEDI-treated patients, including autoimmune hepatitis with primary biliary cirrhosis and a case of biliary obstruction with unclear etiology.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
No specific post-marketing surveillance data on liver injury is provided in the sections given. However, it is common for new adverse events to be identified during post-marketing surveillance as more patients use the medication outside the controlled conditions of clinical trials.

Mitigation Measures:
The label indicates that liver enzyme levels, including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin, should be monitored every four months during treatment and in case of symptoms of hepatic dysfunction. In the event of suspected TEGSEDI-induced liver injury, the medication should be discontinued.

In summary, clinical trial data cited in the product labeling for TEGSEDI demonstrate a relationship between TEGSEDI exposure and acute liver injury. Evidence includes increased liver enzymes noted during trials, case reports of potentially related liver issues, and guidance for monitoring liver function and management of possible liver injury in treated patients. Additional post-marketing data on liver injury related to TEGSEDI could further inform this relationship but was not specified in the provided text. It's important to consider the entire product label and other available sources for a comprehensive understanding of all potential adverse events.",NA
acute liver injury,inotuzumab ozogamicin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for inotuzumab ozogamicin (BESPONSA), evidence indicates that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with the use of this medication. The relationship between inotuzumab ozogamicin and hepatotoxicity is supported by data from clinical trials, adverse reaction reports, and warnings included in the label.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the INO-VATE ALL trial (NCT01564784), ~14% of patients (23 out of 164) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment group experienced hepatotoxicity, including life-threatening and sometimes fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). This hepatotoxicity manifested either during treatment, following treatment, or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Among those patients who underwent a subsequent HSCT, the incidence of VOD increased to ~23% (18 out of 79). Additionally, the clinical trial data indicated that increases in grade 3/4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin levels occurred in 4-5% of patients, indicating liver injury.

Risk Factors and Warnings:
The label warns of hepatotoxicity, including fatal and life-threatening VOD, particularly in patients who receive inotuzumab ozogamicin followed by HSCT. Several risk factors have been identified, including the use of HSCT conditioning regimens containing two alkylating agents, last total bilirubin level ≥ upper limit of normal (ULN) before HSCT, a history of liver disease, a prior HSCT, increased age, and a higher number of inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment cycles. The label advises close monitoring of liver tests before and after each dose, and elevations may require dosing adjustments or permanent discontinuation of the drug.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Although specific post-marketing data from the label is not included, the section for reporting SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS reflects the system for ongoing post-marketing surveillance. Post-marketing data likely contributes to the ongoing assessment of the drug's safety profile and the updating of warning information.

Conclusion:
The evidence from the INO-VATE ALL clinical trial, included in the label, clearly supports a relationship between inotuzumab ozogamicin exposure and the risk of acute liver injury, including severe hepatotoxicity and VOD/SOS. The label contains explicit warnings and precautions to mitigate this risk, illustrating a recognized and significant adverse reaction to the therapy.",NA
acute liver injury,ipilimumab,,"The relevant sections of the drug label for ipilimumab (YERVOY) contain information on a range of adverse reactions reported during clinical trials as well as the post-marketing experience. In the context of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, here's a summary of the data:

Clinical Trials Experience: 
- Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients treated with ipilimumab, with some instances characterized by elevation in liver enzymes and bilirubin. 
- In the clinical trial data provided, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 4.1% (21/511) of patients on the 3 mg/kg dose of YERVOY as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (severe) in 1.6%.
- For the higher 10 mg/kg dose of YERVOY as a single agent, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (73/471) of patients.
- When YERVOY 1 mg/kg was administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients.
- With YERVOY 3 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 1 mg/kg, immune-mediated hepatitis was seen in 15% (70/456) of patients.

Post-marketing Experience: 
- The label notes that immune-mediated hepatitis can occur with YERVOY use based on post-marketing data, although specific incidence rates are not provided.

Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- Patients should be monitored for liver enzyme elevations, and treatment should be withheld or discontinued depending on the severity of liver injury.
- The label advises that corticosteroids may be used to manage immune-mediated hepatitis. In cases that are resistant to corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive treatments may be necessary.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials indicates that acute liver injury in the form of immune-mediated hepatitis is a potential adverse reaction to ipilimumoby, with the frequency increasing at higher doses and in combination with nivolumab. Incidences of severe hepatotoxicity requiring intervention are also reported. Post-marketing surveillance additionally supports the occurrence of liver injury as an adverse response to ipilimumab. The label provides guidelines for monitoring and management to mitigate risks associated with acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,ipilimumab,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ipilimumab (YERVOY) primarily comes from clinical trial experiences described in the drug label. 

Clinical Trials Experience:

1. Ipilimumah as a single agent: 
   - Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 4.1% (21/511) of patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg, with severe (Grade 3-5) cases in 1.6% and moderate (Grade 2) in 2.5%.
   - With the 10 mg/kg dosage, 15% (73/471) developed immune-mediated hepatitis, including Grade 4 (2.8%), Grade 3 (8%), and Grade 2 (5%).

2. Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab:
   - For the treatment of RCC or mCRC, immune-mediated hepatitis was seen in 7% (48/666) of patients at a combination dose of YERVOY 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg of nivolumab, including Grade 4 (1.2%) and Grade 3 (4.9%).
   - In melanoma or HCC patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg, the incidence was 15% (70/456), with Grade 4 (2.4%) and Grade 3 (11%).

In both cases, the frequency of immune-mediated hepatitis leading to permanent discontinuation or dosage interruption of YERVOY, the need for systemic corticosteroids, and in some cases, additional immunosuppressants, highlights the potential for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to ipilimumab. The resolution rate of hepatitis, when treated, was generally high, but recurrence did occur in some patients upon re-initiation of therapy.

Additionally, post-marketing surveillance might provide further insights into real-world incidences of acute liver injury associated with ipilimumab use, but specific data from post-marketing is not included in the provided sections.

Overall, while the rates vary depending on dose and whether ipilimumab is used as a monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab, the evidence from controlled clinical trials supports a relationship between ipilimumab exposure and the potential for acute liver injury. 

Source: The aforementioned drug label sections.",NA
acute liver injury,isavuconazonium,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and isavuconazonium exposure comes from data within clinical trials, as mentioned in the provided drug label sections, and is reinforced by post-marketing experience.

According to the drug label, hepatic adverse drug reactions, including elevations in liver-related tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin), were reported during the clinical trials of isavuconazonium (marketed as CRESEMBA). These reactions were generally reversible and often did not necessitate discontinuation of the medication.

In two clinical trials involving a total of 403 adult patients exposed to CRESEMBA, elevated liver chemistry tests occurred in 16% of patients. Serious hepatic reactions have occurred, and cases of more severe liver-related adverse drug reactions including hepatitis, cholestasis, or hepatic failure, with some resulting in death, have been reported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions during treatment with various azole antifungals, including CRESEMBA.

Post-marketing experience further corroborates these data, with hepatic adverse drug reactions identified among the additional adverse reactions. These occur outside of the controlled environment of clinical trials, representing real-world usage scenarios, although specifics, such as frequency or firm establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure, are more challenging to deduce due to the nature of voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size.

The drug label recommends evaluating liver-related laboratory tests at the beginning and during the course of therapy with CRESEMBA. In case clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease that may be attributable to CRESEMBA develop, the recommendation is to discontinue the medication.

In summary, the evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to isavuconazonium is derived from clinical trial data and post-marketing reports as detailed in the drug label sections provided. These sources suggest a clear association between isavuconazonium and hepatic adverse reactions, which are supported by liver function test monitoring recommendations and noted reports of hepatitis, cholestasis, or hepatic failure linked with treatment.",NA
acute liver injury,isoflurane,,"The provided drug label for isoflurane includes a range of adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical studies as well as post-marketing surveillance. However, acute liver injury — which encompasses conditions such as hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure, hepatitis fulminant, cholestatic hepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, and jaundice — is listed under post-marketing adverse reactions. These are reported voluntarily, and therefore, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the variability in reporting and the uncertain size of the exposed population.

No specific incidence rate is provided for acute liver injury in the drug label, which indicates that either it was not observed in the controlled clinical studies cited or its occurrence did not meet the threshold for reporting in these studies. The label cites increased levels of liver enzymes (e.g., Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, Blood alkaline phosphatase, Blood lactate dehydrogenase) as adverse reactions from the clinical trial data without specifying incidences, which can be indicative of liver injury but are not directly categorized under acute liver injury.

In summary, while post-marketing reports of hepatic disorders exist indicating a possible association with isoflurane exposure, there is no quantitative data provided from the clinical trials to establish the frequency or a definitive causal relationship. Therefore, based on the information provided in the drug label, it is not possible to make a conclusive statement about the causal relationship between acute liver injury and isoflurane exposure. Further post-marketing surveillance and research would be needed to establish such a relationship definitively.","Based on the provided drug label sections for isoflurane, the evidence refuting a direct relationship between acute liver injury and isoflurane is not explicitly detailed. However, it is crucial to note that elevated liver enzymes are listed among the serious reported adverse reactions which could suggest some form of liver impact. This does not directly establish a causative link to acute liver injury, but rather indicates that liver enzyme alterations have been observed, which could imply a spectrum of possible hepatic effects, not necessarily acute liver injury.

Another important observation is that hepatic reactions are listed as post-marketing adverse reactions without a determined frequency. These hepatic reactions include conditions like hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure, hepatitis fulminant, cholestatic hepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, and jaundice. While this indicates that hepatic issues have been reported, the data does not seem to enable a reliable estimation of frequency or a clear causal relationship to isoflurane exposure due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports and the uncertain size of the reporting population.

It's also worth noting that adverse reactions such as increased blood bilirubin and alterations in several liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood alkaline phosphatase, and blood lactate dehydrogenase) are acknowledged without a clear indication of their frequency. This suggests that while there may be some hepatic changes associated with isoflurane, attributing these specifically to acute liver injury is not substantiated by the given data.

In summary, the evidence provided within the label documentation does not decisively refute the relationship between acute liver injury and isoflurane. It does, however, indicate instances of altered liver enzymes and other hepatic reactions post-exposure to isoflurane, although a causative relationship is not established. Without additional context or studies specifically examining the incidence of acute liver injury in patients exposed to isoflurane, the evidence refuting such a relationship is inconclusive. As such, more targeted research would be needed to confirm or refute this relationship definitively."
acute liver injury,isoniazid,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and isoniazid exposure can be drawn from the drug label excerpts you have provided, which summarize clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. The key points from the sections are as follows:

1. **Boxed Warning:** The drug label includes a prominent boxed warning that indicates severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis has been reported with isoniazid therapy. This is the strongest warning that the FDA can require, which implies that the evidence linking isoniazid to acute liver injury is substantial and that the reaction is considered a significant risk associated with the drug.

2. **Hepatic Reactions Section:** Elevated serum transaminase levels are a common adverse effect, with mild hepatic dysfunction observed in 10 to 20 percent of patients. Severe liver injury, including hepatitis that can be fatal, may occur or develop after many months of treatment. A clear association is established, noting that the risk increases with age and is rare in individuals under 20 but more common in older age groups.

3. **Risk Incidence Rates:** The label provides specific incidence rates of hepatitis by age, indicating a well-documented relationship between isoniazid use and the increased risk of developing hepatitis, particularly in older populations.

4. **Fatalities from Hepatitis:** A U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study is cited, which recorded eight deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis in a cohort of 13,838 individuals on isoniazid. Although the exact fatality rate is not provided, the occurrence of deaths underscores the severity of the potential reaction.

5. **Risk Factors:** Several risk factors are mentioned for the development of isoniazid-associated hepatitis, including daily alcohol consumption, chronic liver disease, and injection drug use. Notably, women (particularly black and Hispanic), as well as the postpartum period, are identified as having an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid use.

6. **Clinical Monitoring:** Because of the known hepatotoxicity, the drug label advises close monitoring of patients, especially those over 35 years of age. It recommends regular liver function tests as well as clinical evaluations at monthly intervals for early detection of liver damage.

7. **Management Guidelines:** The label provides guidelines on managing suspected hepatic adverse events, such as discontinuing isoniazid promptly if certain symptoms appear or liver function tests exceed a specified threshold.

In summary, the aforementioned sections of the drug label provide clear evidence from clinical observations, case rates, and the cited surveillance study that there is a significant relationship between isoniazid exposure and the risk of acute liver injury, including severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The evidence includes a variety of sources such as clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and expert consensus reflected in the composition of drug labeling information.","NA

The provided drug label sections indicate that acute liver injury is indeed an adverse reaction associated with isoniazid. There is clear evidence described within the adverse reactions and boxed warnings that links isoniazid to hepatic reactions, including elevated serum transaminase levels, jaundice, and severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. These hepatic reactions can occur at any time during therapy but are more frequent within the first three months. The label emphasizes the increased risk of progressive liver damage with age and with daily consumption of alcohol. It also mentions specific case rates by age, indicating that the relationship between isoniazid and the potential for acute liver injury is well-established. Additionally, the label advises careful monitoring of liver function and provides guidance on how to proceed if liver damage is suspected or confirmed. Therefore, there is substantiated evidence that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction to isoniazid, refuting any claims otherwise."
acute liver injury,isopropyl alcohol,,"The provided drug label sections contain extensive information about the clinical trials, adverse reactions, warnings, precautions, and post-marketing experience with adalimumab, a TNF (tumor necrosis factor) blocker used to treat various autoimmune conditions. The specific evidence related to acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction from isopropyl alcohol exposure, however, is not present within these sections.

According to the sections mentioned:
- Liver enzyme elevations, which may signify liver injury, were reported in clinical trials. Elevated ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients compared to 1.5% in control-treated patients in RA (rheumatoid arthritis), PsA (psoriatic arthritis), and AS (ankylosing spondylitis) trials (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS).
- The relationship between adalimumab and liver enzyme elevations is not clear, especially because many patients were also taking other medications that can cause such elevations.
- Reports of severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, have been noted in patients receiving TNF-blockers, but specific evidence linking these events to isopropyl alcohol is not provided (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience).

The label details the need to evaluate patients for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation before and during treatment with adalimumab, suggesting that liver function is a concern (5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation). However, this is not specific evidence of acute liver injury directly related to isopropyl alcohol. 

In summary, the provided drug label sections for adalimumab suggest a concern for liver injury, as evidenced by liver enzyme elevations and reported severe hepatic reactions in a subset of patients. However, there is no direct reference to isopropyl alcohol as the cause of acute liver injury within the provided sections. Therefore, it is not possible to establish a clear relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to isopropyl alcohol from this information alone. Additional research and evidence would need to be reviewed to determine such a relationship.

For precise assessment, one would need to evaluate the scientific literature specifically examining the adverse effects of isopropyl alcohol on liver function, which could include studies, case reports, or toxicology data outside of the provided label sections.",NA
acute liver injury,isotretinoin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between isotretinoin and acute liver injury comes from multiple sources as indicated on the drug label under section 5.10 on Hepatotoxicity and under Laboratory Abnormalities in section 5.15.

Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Reports:
Clinical trials have shown that approximately 15% of patients treated with isotretinoin experienced mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes, which may indicate liver injury (Section 5.10). These elevations were sometimes reversible with dosage reduction or discontinuation of the drug. More severe cases involving clinical hepatitis have also been reported with isotretinoin use (Section 5.10), with the recommendation to monitor liver function tests prior to and during therapy with isotretinoin.

Postmarketing surveillance has played a role in identifying hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction to isotretinoin since spontaneous reports outside of clinical trial settings have also flagged liver injury associated with isotretinoin use. These spontaneous reports are important because they can identify rare or long-term adverse effects that may not have been seen in clinical trials. However, spontaneous reports lack the controlled conditions of trials and often rely on voluntary reporting, which can introduce bias and underreporting, making it more challenging to establish a clear causality.

The label explicitly advises to discontinue isotretinoin if clinical hepatitis is suspected during treatment and notes that normalization of liver enzymes does not always occur, suggesting a potential for serious and lasting liver injury.

Supporting Laboratory Findings:
The drug label also states that laboratory abnormalities, particularly in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGTP), can be indicators of liver damage (Laboratory Abnormalities, Section 5.15). Since elevated liver enzymes are commonly associated with liver injury, monitoring these levels can serve as a means to detect and manage potential hepatotoxicity.

In conclusion, the relationship between isotretinoin exposure and acute liver injury is supported by evidence from clinical trials, which have documented elevated liver enzymes and clinical hepatitis, and further corroborated by spontaneous postmarketing reports. It is recommended to monitor liver functions before and during isotretinoin therapy and to discontinue the medication if hepatotoxicity is suspected. Additionally, laboratory findings provide objective measures to monitor for the potential adverse reaction of hepatotoxicity during isotretinoin treatment.",NA
acute liver injury,itraconazole,1.0,"The evidence indicating a relationship between acute liver injury and itraconazole exposure comes from various sources, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

Clinical Trials:
The drug label excerpts report that itraconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, which could include acute liver injury. Hepatotoxicity was observed even in some patients who did not have pre-existing liver disease or a serious underlying medical condition. In trials involving patients treated for systemic fungal disease, 3% experienced abnormal hepatic function. Additionally, 4% of patients in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials had elevated liver enzymes (greater than twice the upper limit of normal), which could be reflective of acute liver injury.

Case Studies:
The label does not cite specific case studies, but reference to ""cases"" suggests that there have been documented instances of acute liver injury that have been examined on a case-by-case basis. These instances have contributed to the recognition of hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction to itraconazole.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing reports have identified serious hepatotoxicity, including some cases of fatal acute liver failure, as an adverse reaction to itraconazole. Such outcomes would include acute liver injury. These reports, although voluntarily submitted and not offering a robust estimation of frequency, nonetheless provide ongoing surveillance and evidence of the drug's potential adverse effects on liver function after it has been approved and marketed.

Warnings:
The drug label includes warnings that emphasize the risk of liver injury. It instructs that if clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, the drug should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. Additionally, there's a note about reassessing the risks and benefits of itraconazole use in the context of these hepatic effects—underscoring the significance of the potential for liver injury.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and itraconazole exposure is supported by observations of hepatotoxicity in clinical trial data, descriptions of serious adverse hepatic outcomes in post-marketing reports, and the inclusion of liver injury warnings on the itraconazole drug label. The drug label serves as the source for this documented evidence.",NA
acute liver injury,ivacaftor,,"Evidence from the provided sections of the drug label shows that there is a relationship between ivacaftor exposure and acute liver injury, which can manifest as transaminase elevations (elevated ALT and/or AST levels).

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The drug label includes instances from several clinical trials where transaminase elevations were observed as an adverse reaction to ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were either treated with ivacaftor or placebo. These trials include:

- Trials 1 and 2 (Pooled Data): Among patients aged 6 years and older, treated with KALYDECO (ivacaftor), which included 221 patients, there was a reported incidence of maximum transaminase elevations >3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in KALYDECO-treated patients compared to those on placebo.

- Trial 6: In an open-label clinical trial involving 34 pediatric patients (2 to less than 6 years old), 14.7% (5/34) experienced ALT or AST elevations more than three times the ULN. Furthermore, all five of these patients had ALT or AST levels more than eight times the ULN, which returned to baseline following interruption of KALYDECO dosing.

- Trial 8: In patients aged less than 24 months, there were incidences of ALT or AST >3 × ULN, with one patient discontinuing treatment due to elevated transaminase levels.

These clinical trials suggest a relationship between ivacaftor treatment and liver injury as indicated by elevated transaminase levels.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
Post-marketing reports have identified liver transaminase elevations as an adverse reaction to KALYDECO. Since post-marketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, it is harder to estimate frequency or establish a strong causal relationship; however, these reports do add real-world evidence that supports clinical trial findings.

Warnings and Precautions on the Drug Label:
The drug label includes warnings about transaminase elevations as a significant concern and includes recommendations for monitoring liver function tests before and during treatment with KALYDECO. Specifically, monitoring is recommended before starting treatment, every three months during the first year, and annually after that, which underscores the importance of this potential adverse reaction.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences, as specified in the drug label, support a relationship between ivacaftor exposure and acute liver injury, which is recognized as an adverse reaction with appropriate warnings and monitoring recommendations.",NA
acute liver injury,ivacaftor,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and ivacaftor (KALYDECO) exposure. This evidence can be found detailed in the label under the heading ""Transaminase Elevations"" in the section for adverse reactions (6) and warnings and precautions (5.1), and is drawn from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials Evidence (Section 6.1):

1. Transaminase elevations were reported in clinical trials of ivacaftor. Specifically, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) was noted:
   - Trials 1, 2, and 3 showed that transaminase elevations >8, >5, or >3 times the ULN were present in 2%, 2%, and 6% of KALYDECO-treated patients, respectively.
   - Trial 6, which included patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, showed that 14.7% of patients experienced transaminase elevations (>3 times the ULN), with all five patients experiencing levels >8 times the ULN.
   - Trial 8 found elevated transaminase levels in cohorts of patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months, with 27.8% of patients displaying levels >3 times the ULN.

2. There were instances where treatment with KALYDECO was permanently discontinued due to elevated transaminases, and some instances were reported as serious adverse reactions.

Post-Marketing Experience (Section 6.2):

In the postmarketing setting, adverse reactions including elevated transaminases have been identified, although the exact frequency of these reactions could not be reliably estimated due to the spontaneous and voluntary nature of these reports.

Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.1):

The warnings and precautions section advises monitoring of liver function tests (transaminases) prior to starting KALYDECO and during treatment, particularly in patients with a history of transaminase elevations. It is recommended that dosing be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST greater than 5 times the ULN, reflecting a concern for potential liver injury.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggests that acute liver injury, manifested as elevated transaminases, is a potential adverse reaction of ivacaftor. It is significant enough to warrant specific monitoring guidelines and warnings in the medication's label. The clinical significance of these liver function test abnormalities should be considered alongside individual patient circumstances and with awareness that liver injury can be serious. Continued vigilance in monitoring liver function is recommended for patients taking ivacaftor.",NA
acute liver injury,ixabepilone,,"The specific query regarding the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ixabepilone exposure requires examination of the provided drug label sections.

The sections provided from the drug label do not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction (≥20%) in the ""Adverse Reactions"" section. Instead, the most commonly reported adverse reactions include peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue/asthenia, myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain, among others. Hematologic laboratory abnormalities commonly observed are neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

However, hepatobiliary disorders such as acute hepatic failure and jaundice are mentioned within the adverse reactions reported in the clinical studies section, although no specific incidence or evidence for a direct causal relationship to ixabepilone is provided. The clinical trials' data do not provide a clear quantification or characterization of liver-related adverse reactions outside of those few mentions.

Regarding post-marketing experience, which often can capture rarer adverse events, the label only mentions ""increased transaminases"" as a reported adverse reaction, with no quantitative frequency provided and with the caveat that establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is challenging due to the voluntary nature of these reports.

The ""Warnings and Precautions"" section, specifically under ""Increased Toxicities in Patients with Hepatic Impairment,"" indicates the drug should be used cautiously in patients with liver impairment, due to the increased risk of toxicity. The fact that ixabepilone is contraindicated in patients with AST or ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal or bilirubin greater than 1 times the upper limit of normal, suggests that there is an established concern regarding the effect of ixabepilone on the liver. Patients with hepatic impairment presented more grade 3/4 adverse reactions and increased incidence of febrile neutropenia and serious adverse reactions.

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is suggestive evidence that ixabepilone may cause hepatobiliary adverse reactions including acute hepatic failure and jaundice noted in clinical studies and increased transaminases in the post-marketing setting. However, conclusive data specifying the frequency and establishing a causal link between ixabepilone and acute liver injury, especially one that qualifies as ""acute liver injury,"" is not explicitly provided.

In conclusion, there appears to be some recognition that ixabepilone has hepatotoxic potential, particularly for patients with existing hepatic impairment, but detailed, quantified evidence specifically attributing acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of ixabepilone is not available from the sections of the drug label provided.",NA
acute liver injury,ixazomib,,"Based on the drug label sections provided for ixazomib (brand name NINLARO), there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ixazomib exposure. This evidence comes from post-marketing experiences and clinical trials.

In Section 5.7 ('Hepatotoxicity') of the drug label, it is noted that drug-induced liver injury, hepatocellular injury, hepatic steatosis, and hepatitis cholestatic, all indicative of acute liver injury, have been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with NINLARO. Moreover, this section mentions that ""Hepatotoxicity has been reported"" with 10% incidence in the NINLARO regimen compared to 9% in the placebo regimen, indicating that while the difference is not substantial, there is a notable association between ixazomib therapy and hepatotoxic effects. Hepatic enzyme monitoring is recommended during treatment, which implies the recognition of potential liver-related adverse effects as a result of ixazomib administration. 

In addition, the drug label advises adjusting dosing for Grade 3 or 4 symptoms of hepatotoxicity, which reflects the severity of liver injury that can be associated with this drug. The severity scale typically categorizes Grade 3 as severe and undesirable adverse events, while Grade 4 represents life-threatening consequences.

The label does not specify whether the hepatotoxic events were directly associated with acute liver injury or how many cases were reversible upon discontinuation of ixazomib. Furthermore, it is important to note that the evidence regarding hepatotoxicity does not specify within the label the fraction of these events that qualifies as ""acute liver injury."" Therefore, while hepatotoxicity is established as a potential adverse effect of ixazomib, more detailed breakdown and characterization of liver-related adverse events would be needed, ideally from published clinical trial data or peer-reviewed studies, for a comprehensive understanding of the connection to acute liver injury specifically.

In conclusion, the drug label for ixazomib acknowledges hepatotoxic effects that can be linked to acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to the drug. These are based on clinical trial findings and post-marketing reports, although the detail provided in the label is not extensive regarding the exact nature and frequency of acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,ketamine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ketamine exposure is detailed in section 5.6 of the drug label under ""Drug-Induced Liver Injury."" The label indicates that ketamine administration, particularly recurrent use (e.g., misuse/abuse or medically supervised unapproved indications), is associated with hepatobiliary dysfunction, typically displaying a cholestatic pattern. It also mentions cases of biliary duct dilatation, with or without evidence of biliary obstruction, reported with recurrent use of ketamine.

There is no explicit mention of acute liver injury per se, but drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a broad term that encompasses various forms of liver damage, including acute liver injury. It's important to differentiate between chronic hepatobiliary dysfunction and acute liver injury, although both may be a part of the spectrum of DILI.

The label also recommends obtaining baseline liver function tests (LFTs), including alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase, in patients who are scheduled to receive ketamine on a recurrent basis. It advises monitoring LFTs at periodic intervals during treatment with ketamine to detect any liver injury early.

The information in the label suggests that there is evidence from postmarketing reports and clinical experience which implies a relationship between ketamine use and hepatobiliary dysfunction. Since the specific details about the studies or clinical trials are not provided in your message, we cannot comment on the exact nature of the evidence, such as the incidence rate, severity, or the specific clinical trial data.

Keep in mind that postmarketing surveillance often includes voluntary reports which may not always provide sufficient data to establish a firm causal relationship between the drug exposure and the adverse event due to varying report quality and potential underreporting.

In summary, while the drug label mentions hepatobiliary dysfunction associated with the recurrent use of ketamine, it does not provide specific details on acute liver injury incidents. This relationship is suggested based on postmarketing reports, and the outlined monitoring precautions indicate a level of concern for potential liver injury with recurrent use of the drug.",NA
acute liver injury,ketoconazole,,"Evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury and ketoconazole exposure predominantly comes from systemic administration of the medication rather than topical formulations such as ketoconazole cream.

Ketoconazole is recognized for its potential to cause hepatotoxicity when administered orally. The evidence includes:

1. Clinical Trials:
The risk of hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials involving oral ketoconazole. These trials have identified instances of elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, and in severe cases, acute liver failure leading to transplantation or death.

2. Case Studies:
There is a well-documented range of case reports and series that associate oral ketoconazole with acute liver injury. These case studies typically describe a temporal relationship between the drug intake and the onset of liver injury, improvement upon cessation of the drug, and, in some situations, recurrence of liver injury upon rechallenge.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
The adverse event databases and post-marketing surveillance have provided further evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to oral ketoconazole. Due to these safety concerns, regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have limited the use of oral ketoconazole because of the risk of serious liver damage.

However, the information provided from the drug label concerning ketoconazole cream (topical application) does not indicate a recognized association with acute liver injury. The adverse reactions and warnings from the label primarily mention local skin reactions, such as irritation, pruritus, and stinging; allergic reactions; and contact dermatitis. The absence of liver injury reports in the context of the topical formulation does not align with the known hepatic risk profile of the oral formulation.

The topical form of ketoconazole has minimal systemic absorption, which significantly reduces the risk of systemic effects, including liver injury. Thus, while the potential for acute liver injury is a concern with oral ketoconazole, the current label information you provided does not support this association with the topical cream formulation.

In conclusion, there is clear evidence associating oral ketoconazole with the risk of acute liver injury, but there is no known evidence supporting this adverse reaction for ketoconazole cream based on the label information provided. It is crucial for healthcare providers to distinguish between the forms of medication when considering their safety profiles.",NA
acute liver injury,ketorolac,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence that ketorolac can lead to adverse liver reactions, including acute liver injury. Key points from this information are summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
1. Elevations in liver enzymes were listed among the adverse reactions observed in 1% to 10% of patients taking ketorolac in clinical trials.
2. Hepatitis and jaundice, which are indicative of liver injury, were reported as occurring occasionally (<1%) in the same patient population.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
1. The drug label mentions liver failure as one of the ""rarely observed reactions"" from postmarketing experience with ketorolac. While the frequency is not specified, this indicates that after ketorolac was released into the market, there have been observed incidents of acute liver failure potentially associated with its use.
2. These post-marketing reports suggest that despite being rare, acute liver injury is a serious and possibly life-threatening adverse reaction that has been identified outside of the controlled environment of clinical trials.

Box Warnings and Other Warnings:
1. In the box warning, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury. However, the serious nature of other complications listed (such as gastrointestinal risks and renal risks) indicates that ketorolac must be prescribed and administered with caution.
2. Admonitions to adjust dosages for certain populations and to avoid use with other NSAIDs due to cumulative risks further reinforce the seriousness of adverse effects that can accompany ketorolac administration.

In conclusion, there is evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data that supports the relationship between acute liver injury and ketorolac exposure. Although specific incidences are not quantified in these sections, liver-related adverse effects including hepatitis, jaundice, and liver failure have been reported with the use of ketorolac. It is important for healthcare providers to consider these risks when prescribing ketorolac and to monitor liver function as part of the overall safety management for patients receiving this medication.","NA

The information provided in the drug label explicitly lists liver failure among the severe complications associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine. Additionally, it mentions that other NSAID-related liver complications, such as hepatitis and jaundice, may occur. These details come from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance as part of the adverse reactions section of the drug label, which are reliable sources of evidence. Consequently, the label supports the relationship between ketorolac tromethamine exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, thus refuting evidence is not available given the present label information."
acute liver injury,labetalol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for labetalol, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction can be identified through a review of the ""Liver and Biliary System"" subsection under the ""less common adverse events."" Here, the following liver-related adverse effects are reported:

- Hepatic necrosis
- Hepatitis
- Cholestatic jaundice
- Elevated liver function tests

These indicate that there have been observations of liver-related adverse events in patients treated with labetalol. Elevated liver function tests, in particular, suggest that liver injury can occur in some patients. The mention of hepatic necrosis and hepatitis, although less common, reflects more severe forms of liver injury associated with drug exposure. The label also notes that such reactions were reported spontaneously.

Furthermore, under the ""Clinical Laboratory Tests"" section of the label, there is mention of ""reversible increases of serum transaminases in 4% of patients treated with labetalol hydrochloride."" This confirms that there is evidence to support a relationship between labetalol and adverse liver effects since transaminases are enzymes that become elevated during liver injury.

While the label does not detail the incidence rate of acute liver injury specifically, it does provide evidence that labetalol has the potential to cause liver-related adverse effects. This conclusion is based on clinical trial data, post-marketing experience, and spontaneous reporting systems.

Overall, the evidence from the labetalol drug label indicates that there is a recognized relationship between labetalol exposure and adverse liver effects, which can range from mild liver enzyme elevations to more severe liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,lamivudine,1.0,"The provided drug label for lamivudine, which is utilized in the treatment of HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B, contains several relevant sections regarding adverse reactions and liver-related warnings that may suggest a link between the drug and acute liver injury. However, it should be noted that acute liver injury per se is not explicitly listed in the adverse reactions or warnings. Here’s a summary of the relevant evidence found within the label:

**Clinical Trials Experience in Adults and Pediatric Subjects:**
- Hepatic abnormalities reported: In clinical trials involving adult subjects taking lamivindiue, Grade 3 to 4 elevations in liver enzymes ALT and AST were observed in a minority of subjects (ALT >5.0 x ULN in 3.7% of subjects, AST >5.0 x ULN in 1.7%).
- Pancreatitis incidence: Pancreatitis, which can indicate significant liver stress or damage, was observed in a small percentage of adult subjects (0.3%) and in pediatric subjects.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis have been noted post-approval—conditions which reflect serious liver injury. The label includes a warning for severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, suggesting a recognized risk for liver-related adverse events.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- Exacerbations of hepatitis B: For co-infected HIV-1/HBV patients, severe exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported after discontinuation of lamivudine.
- Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly: The prescription information includes a warning about lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, conditions associated with liver damage, specifying that cases can be fatal.

While there is no unambiguous reporting of acute liver injury as a direct adverse reaction to lamivudine in the drug label, several sections indicate potential liver-related issues associated with its use. Elevated liver enzymes, pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, and hepatomegaly with steatosis are conditions that can be associated with liver damage, which may be acute in nature. These conditions were identified both during clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. It is essential for clinicians to carefully monitor liver function in patients treated with lamivudine, especially those co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, and those who have discontinued lamivudine therapy. 

For a definitive causal relationship between lamivudine and acute liver injury, one would ideally look for case reports or studies explicitly linking lamivudine with instances of acute liver injury, reported in scientific literature outside of the drug label. However, based on the information provided, there is at least an association between lamivudine and liver-related adverse outcomes which could theoretically include acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,lamotrigine,1.0,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction to lamotrigine in the information provided. However, under section 5.3, ""Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure,"" there is mention that some patients have experienced multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which have been fatal or life-threatening. These reactions can present with various organ involvements such as hepatitis and hepatic failure, which can be construed as acute liver injury.

Additionally, in the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section (section 6.3), there is an acknowledgment of isolated liver failure cases without rash or involvement of other organs reported with lamotrigine. The liver is mentioned as one of the organs that can be involved in multiorgan failure leading to death. As these instances occurred postmarketing, it implies that they might not have been captured in the premarketing reports and arose from broader use in the general population after regulatory approval.

The specific incidence of acute liver injury related to lamotrigine is not detailed in the provided information, and it appears to be a rare event based on this documentation. The evidence linking lamotrigine to acute liver injury largely seems to come from post-marketing reports and the known potential for multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions that include liver involvement. It is crucial for healthcare providers to monitor for symptoms of severe skin, liver, or hypersensitivity reactions and manage patients appropriately, which may include discontinuation of the drug.

To obtain more definitive evidence of the relationship between lamotrigine and acute liver injury, it would be necessary to review case studies, reports in the scientific literature, and more detailed post-marketing surveillance data beyond what is provided in the drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,lansoprazole,,"The provided drug label sections for lansoprazole do not explicitly list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. However, there is mention of hepatotoxicity in the postmarketing experience section, which might encompass various types of liver injury, including acute liver injury.

Here is a summary based on the sections provided:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
Over 10,000 patients treated with lansoprazole in Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials did not report acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. The commonly reported adverse reactions (≥1%) were diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation. Additional but uncommon adverse reactions included various other conditions but did not explicitly mention acute liver injury.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
Post-market surveillance has reported hepatotoxicity among other adverse experiences. Since the scope of hepatotoxicity can include a range of liver injuries, from mild elevations in liver enzymes to acute liver failure, it's possible that acute liver injury falls within this category. However, the label specifies that because these reactions are reported voluntarily and from a population of unknown insert size, a direct relationship to lansoprazole has not been established, and frequency estimations cannot be made.

**Laboratory Values:**
Abnormal liver function tests were reported as adverse reactions. In controlled studies, a minor percentage of patients had enzyme elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal range.

In the absence of explicit listings or reported incidences of acute liver injury, we cannot definitively conclude that acute liver injury is a characterized adverse reaction of lansoprazole based on these sections of the drug label. Nevertheless, the mention of hepatotoxicity in postmarketing reports suggests that liver injury is possible, though a direct causal relationship may not be well-defined or quantifiable with the provided information.

To establish a more robust connection between lansoprazole and acute liver injury, we would need additional data not provided in the label, such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or case series demonstrating such adverse reactions in patients taking lansoprazole. Without this information, we cannot confirm the relationship between lansoprazole exposure and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,lapatinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to lapatinib can be summarized based on information from clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and the associated warnings present in the drug label.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
Clinical trials involving more than 12,000 patients have evaluated the safety of lapatinib, especially in the combination with capecitabine and letrozole for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Liver function abnormalities, such as elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), have been observed in clinical trials, with some patients experiencing hepatotoxicity indicated by increases in bilirubin levels. The drug label explicitly states that hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials. Although the specific rate is not provided, it mentions that such events were less than 1% of the patients.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
The drug label also indicates that hepatotoxicity has been identified during post-approval use of lapatinib. These post-marketing observations are critical as they include data from a broader range of patients in a real-world setting, which may offer additional insights not captured in clinical trials.

Warnings on Drug Label:
The label of lapatinib contains a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity, highlighting that severe liver injury and deaths have been reported. It advises monitoring liver function tests before treatment initiation and at regular intervals during treatment. The boxed warning, which is the FDA's most stringent warning for prescription medications, underscores the severity and potential risk of liver injury with lapatinib use.

Additional Considerations:
The evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, along with the strong warnings on the drug label, support the relationship between lapatinib exposure and the potential risk of acute liver injury. While the exact incidence is not provided in the provided text, it is clear that hepatotoxicity is a recognized adverse reaction of lapatinib therapy, and patients on lapatinib should be closely monitored for liver function abnormalities.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and lapatinib is supported by clinical trial data, post-market surveillance, and highlighted within the boxed warnings of the drug label, underscoping the severity and potential risk of this adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,larotrectinib,,"Evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and larotrectinib (VITRAKVI) exposure can be summarized based on details provided in the drug label sections concerning adverse reactions, warnings, and clinical trial experience.

Clinical Trial Experience:
Larotrectinib clinical trial data involves 279 patients. The most common liver-related adverse reactions included increased aspartate transaminase (AST) in 52% of patients and increased alanine transaminase (ALT) in 45%. Grades 3-4 increased AST or ALT were observed in 3.1% and 2.5% of patients, respectively.

Hepatotoxicity Warning:
The drug label warns about the risk of hepatotoxicity, including drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The label specifically advises monitoring liver function tests before the start of larotrectinib and then regularly during treatment. It provides instructions for dose modifications or discontinuation in response to changes in liver enzymes, indicating a recognized risk of liver damage from the drug.

According to the label, ALT or AST increase led to permanent discontinuation in 1.1% of patients. There have been additional reports of adult patients from clinical studies and post-marketing cases showing Grade ≥2 increases in ALT and/or AST with concomitant increases in bilirubin ≥2 times the upper limit of normal, which would constitute significant hepatotoxicity. 

The information provided draws a clear link between larotrectinib use and an increased risk of liver enzyme elevations, which can be indicative of acute liver injury. The specifics of the drug's potential to cause serious liver damage, including liver injury with significant bilirubin elevations, arise from both clinical trial data and post-marketing reports.

As stated in the label, the hepatotoxic effects are managed through regular monitoring and potential dose adjustments or discontinuation, which emphasizes the importance of these adverse reactions.

It's crucial to acknowledge that this summary is based on reported adverse reactions and label warnings, and post-marketing surveillance. These data sources, particularly when consistent across different types of studies and reports, provide substantial evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and exposure to larotrectinib.",NA
acute liver injury,leflunomide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to leflunomide includes information from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
1. In clinical trials, treatment with leflunomide was associated with elevations of liver enzymes (ALT and AST), indicating potential hepatotoxicity. Most elevations were mild and resolved while on treatment, but marked elevations (>3-fold Upper Limits of Normal [ULN]) were also observed, which reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation.
2. In a specific 6-month study of patients with persistent active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy, 3.8% of patients who started on leflunomide experienced an elevation in ALT greater than or equal to three times the ULN.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
1. Post-marketing reports have identified severe cases of liver injury, including acute hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, and instances of severe liver injury such as hepatic failure in association with leflunomide use. However, due to the voluntary and often underreported nature of post-marketing surveillance, it is difficult to establish frequency or causal relationship to drug exposure definitively.

**Label Warnings:**
1. The label contains a boxed warning that highlights the risk of hepatotoxicity, indicating severe liver injury and fatal liver failure in patients treated with leflunomide.
2. It is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and in those with serum ALT >2xULN before initiating treatment.
3. Monitoring of liver enzyme levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide treatment and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter.

**Risk Evaluation and Mitigation:**
1. If leflunomide-induced liver injury is suspected, the drug should be discontinued, and an accelerated drug elimination procedure should be initiated.
2. Patients with pre-existing liver disease or those taking other potentially hepatotoxic drugs are advised against using leflunomide due to increased risk.

In summary, there is evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that supports the association of acute liver injury with leflunomide exposure. The drug label acknowledges this risk and provides guidance for monitoring and management to mitigate the potential hepatotoxic effects of the drug.","NA

Given the provided sections of the drug label for leflunomide, which detail various adverse reactions and warnings including hepatotoxicity, the request for evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and leflunomide is not applicable. The sections explicitly list hepatotoxicity as a serious risk associated with the medication and describe instances of elevated liver enzymes and severe liver injury in some patients. Therefore, there is established evidence supporting the relationship between leflunomide use and potential adverse liver reactions, rather than refuting it."
acute liver injury,lenalidomide,,"Based on the information provided, there is evidence to suggest that hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, is an identified adverse reaction associated with the use of lenalidomide. The drug label specifically mentions hepatotoxicity as a clinically significant adverse reaction detailed in the warnings and precautions section (5.8).

Clinical Trials Experience:
The clinical trials experience section (6.1) of the label does not explicitly list acute liver injury among the various reported adverse reactions for lenalidomide. However, it does state that 15% of patients experienced hepatotoxicity (encompassing hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed characteristics), with 2% of patients with multiple myeloma having serious hepatotoxicity events.

Postmarketing Experience:
In the postmarketing experience section (6.2), it is indicated that hepatic failure, including fatal cases, as well as other liver-related adverse events like toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, mixed cytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis, and transient abnormal liver laboratory tests have been reported with lenalidomide use. While postmarketing experiences are voluntary reports and the actual incidence rate is unclear, the inclusion of hepatic failure and various forms of hepatitis supports the potential relationship between lenalidomide exposure and acute liver injury.

Warnings and Precautions:
The warnings and precautions section (5.8) explicitly warns of the risk of hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure, with lenalidomide treatment. It advises monitoring liver enzymes periodically and recommends discontinuation of lenalidomide upon elevation of liver enzymes. The label advises that after liver enzymes return to baseline, rechallenge with a lower dose of lenalidomide may be considered.

To conclude, the drug label for lenalidomide provides evidence that hepatotoxicity, which can include acute liver injury, is an adverse reaction of lenalidomide. This relationship is supported by clinical trials experience showing a percentage of patients developing serious hepatotoxicity, postmarketing reports of hepatic failure and hepatitis, and specific cautions in the warnings and precautions section of the label regarding the potential for liver-related adverse effects.",NA
acute liver injury,leuprolide,,"The evidence provided in the provided sections of the drug label for leuprolide (ELIGARD) does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (with an incidence ≥5%) included malaise, fatigue, hot flashes/sweats, and testicular atrophy. Additional adverse reactions described in the clinical trial experience section and postmarketing experience include tumor flare, hyperglycemia and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, effects on the QT/QTc interval, convulsions, and pituitary apoplexy, among other systemic adverse reactions. Laboratory test findings and changes in bone density are also discussed.

Below is a concise summary of the evidence regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to leuprolide based on the available information from the drug's labeling:

- Clinical Trials: The sections from the clinical trial experience detailing adverse reactions (section 6.1) do not specifically report acute liver injury as a finding. The safety assessment included various systemic adverse reactions, but liver injury was not mentioned.

- Postmarketing Surveillance: In postmarketing experience (section 6.2), where adverse reactions are voluntarily reported and may not always reflect reliable estimations of frequency or causality, acute liver injury is not listed among the identified reactions.

- Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions Sections (5.x): In these sections, where significant and serious adverse reactions are highlighted, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a risk related to leuprolide use.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug labeling information, there is no evidence to support a relationship between acute liver injury and leuprolide (ELIGARD) use. It is important to note that absence of evidence in the label does not rule out the possibility of such an adverse reaction, as postmarketing reports may uncover additional risks. However, as per the information provided, acute liver injury is not recognized as an established adverse reaction associated with this medication. Health professionals and patients should report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate channels to ensure ongoing safety monitoring.",NA
acute liver injury,levetiracetam,,"The provided sections of the drug label for levetiracetam do not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in controlled clinical trials. However, abnormal liver function tests are mentioned in the section on postmarketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience). This implies that while acute liver injury was not a frequently observed adverse reaction in the controlled settings of clinical trials, there have been instances of liver-related adverse events reported in the postmarketing phase where the drug is used in a wider population.

To summarize the evidence regarding acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to levetiracetam:

1. **Clinical Trials**: Controlled clinical trials listed in the provided sections did not commonly report acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. None of the tables (Tables 3 to 9) detailing adverse reactions in both adult and pediatric populations indicate liver injury as a significant concern during the trials.

2. **Postmarketing Surveillance**: Abnormal liver function tests are identified as an adverse event in the postmarketing experience of levetiracetam. This suggests that after the drug entered the market, and a broader patient population used it, there have been voluntary reports of liver-related issues. However, because postmarketing reports are voluntarily submitted and the size of the affected population is uncertain, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of acute liver injury or to firmly establish a causal relationship to levetiracetam exposure.

3. **Other Sources**: The label does not mention case studies specifically pertaining to acute liver injury and levetiracetam. To provide a more complete summary, a literature search would be needed to identify any case reports or additional studies that further investigate this potential association.

In conclusion, the label information for levetiracetam includes postmarketing reports of abnormal liver function tests but does not establish a frequency or a definitive causal relationship between drug exposure and acute liver injury. More detailed evidence, potentially from case studies or further research, would be necessary to conclusively establish such a relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,levofloxacin,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and levofloxacin exposure primarily stems from post-marketing reports rather than clinical trial data.

Clinical Trials:
In the pooled analysis of 29 Phase 3 clinical trials with 7,537 patients exposed to levofloxacin, hepatobiliary disorders such as ""abnormal hepatic function,"" ""increased hepatic enzymes,"" and ""increased alkaline phosphatase"" are listed as less common adverse reactions (0.1 to 1%) (Section 6.1). Meanwhile, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury in the clinical trial experience section, implying that severe hepatotoxicity was not a prominent clinical trial finding.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The post-marketing experience section (6.2) offers more insight, noting reports of severe hepatotoxicity, including acute hepatitis and fatal events, in patients treated with levofloxacin. It specifies that severe hepatotoxicity often occurred within 14 days of therapy initiation, most commonly within the first 6 days, and was not typically linked to hypersensitivity reactions. Elderly patients were more frequently associated with these reports of fatal hepatotoxicity, which occurred without an apparent hypersensitivity component.

Warnings and Precautions:
The section on hepatotoxicity (5.8) emphasizes that post-marketing reports have documented severe liver injury, including fatalities, which can emerge quickly following treatment onset. Patients should cease levofloxacin immediately upon detection of symptoms suggestive of hepatitis.

Overall, while the clinical trials for levofloxacin did report less severe hepatobiliary adverse reactions, the more significant concerns about acute liver injury arise from post-marketing surveillance data. The information suggests a causal relationship between levofloxacin exposure and acute liver injury, particularly given the rapid onset of severe hepatotoxicity noted in some cases after treatment initiation. Health care professionals are advised to exercise caution and discontinue levofloxacin at the first signs of liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,levomilnacipran,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections regarding adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings for levomilnacipran, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance.

During the clinical studies experience section (6.1), a range of adverse reactions were documented, including gastrointestinal issues, cardiac disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and other effects like hyperhidrosis and hot flush. However, acute liver injury was not listed among the documented adverse reactions. The label notes that other infrequent adverse reactions not described in detail in the label, occurring at an incidence of less than 2%, did include ""liver function test abnormal,"" but it did not specifically state that acute liver injury was observed.

In the post-marketing experience section (6.2), there is also no report of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction in the context of post-approval use of levomilnacipran or other selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

Therefore, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no known evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction related to levomilnacipran exposure. If additional studies or case reports outside of the drug label have reported acute liver injury in association with levomilnacipran, they were not included in your summary and without them, a relationship cannot be established. For the most up-to-date information, it would be important to consult current medical literature and databases for any newly reported cases or research findings.",NA
acute liver injury,lincomycin,,"Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to lincomycin is not explicitly documented in the provided sections of the drug label, which include adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings. The hepatobiliary disorders mentioned regarding lincomycin usage are jaundice, liver function test abnormal, and transaminases increased. While these hepatic issues could theoretically be linked to acute liver injury, there's no direct reference to acute liver injury itself in the information provided.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The provided sections do not delineate specific evidence from clinical trials linking lincomycin to acute liver injury. When clinical trials reveal adverse hepatic reactions, these are usually included in the drug's label under adverse reactions or warnings, which seems not to be the case directly for acute liver injury here.

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Relevant information from case studies and post-marketing surveillance on the relationship between lincomycin and acute liver injury is not provided in the sections given. Adverse drug reactions that surface after a drug reaches the market can emerge from post-marketing surveillance or case studies, and these are generally described in the product labeling if confirmed.

In conclusion, within the presented sections of the lincomycin drug label, there is no direct evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to lincomycin. However, some liver-related adverse reactions like jaundice and abnormal liver function tests are noted. For a conclusive summary, it would be necessary to consult the full range of scientific literature and post-marketing data, which may include case reports or database studies not referenced in the supplied label excerpts. If there have been cases of acute liver injury associated with lincomycin not specified in the label, these sources could reveal such evidence. In the absence of additional information, we cannot conclusively link lincomycin to acute liver injury. Always refer to the most current and comprehensive sources for drug safety information.",NA
acute liver injury,linezolid,,"The information provided from the drug label of linezolid does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials for linezolid (>5% of adult and pediatric patients) include diarrhea, vomiting, headache, nausea, and anemia. Additionally, Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the label describe clinical trial experiences and postmarketing surveillance data.

Section 6.1, which reports on clinical trial experiences with linezolid, specifically mentions abnormal liver function tests in 0.4% of adult patients treated for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) with linezolid. Furthermore, Tables 5 and 7 from the same section present percentages of adult and pediatric patients who experienced substantially abnormal liver-related serum chemistry laboratory values, including elevated levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), which are indicators of liver function. For example, 1.3%-6.8% of adult patients on linezolid experienced elevations in AST and 1.7%-9.6% experienced elevations in ALT. These findings suggest that there is some evidence from clinical trials indicating potential hepatotoxicity in patients taking linezolid.

Section 6.2 addresses postmarketing experiences, indirectly mentioning that thrombocytopenia has been noted more often in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, which could be suggestive of a drug effect on the liver. However, acute liver injury is not specifically listed among the identified adverse reactions during postapproval use of linezolid.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction to linezolid, evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance suggests that linezolid can cause elevations in liver enzyme levels and treatment-related adverse hepatic events, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disorders. Clinical practitioners should be aware of these potential hepatic side effects and monitor liver function in patients receiving linezolid therapy, especially for prolonged periods or in the presence of hepatic impairment.","Based on the provided drug label information, acute liver injury is not listed as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials for linezolid. The label includes details on common adverse reactions observed in more than 5% of adult and/or pediatric patients treated with linezolid, and while abnormal liver function tests are reported, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury.

The label does indicate abnormal liver function tests occurring in 1.6% of adult patients treated with linezolid for indications other than uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). However, these findings are not directly equated to acute liver injury, and the term ""abnormal liver function tests"" can encompass a range of liver-related abnormalities that do not necessarily imply acute injury.

It is also important to note that the postmarketing experience section of the label, which could capture adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials, does not list acute liver injury either.

Therefore, based on the evidence available in the drug label, acute liver injury is not characterized as an adverse reaction of linezolid. However, this conclusion is based on the information provided by the drug label and does not include a comprehensive review of all published literature. Regular monitoring and post-marketing surveillance might provide updated information that could influence this assessment."
acute liver injury,lisinopril,1.0,"The provided drug label for lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section (6). The clinical trials experience detailed in section 6.1 highlights headaches, dizziness, cough, hypotension, and chest pain among the more frequent adverse reactions observed, with greater incidence than placebo. In the ""Post-marketing Experience"" section (6.2), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury either.

However, section 5.6 on ""Hepatic Failure"" acknowledges a rare but serious adverse effect related to ACE inhibitors, indicating that these drugs have been associated with a syndrome that may start with cholestyramine jaundice or hepatitis and can progress to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The exact mechanism behind this reaction is not well understood, but it suggests a potential relationship between hepatic dysfunction and ACE inhibitor use, including lisinopril.

It should be noted that this represents a severe reaction and is distinctly different from acute liver injury, which refers to a less severe form of liver damage that is usually reversible upon cessation of the drug.

To summarize, acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction to lisinopril in the provided sections of the drug label, nor is there explicit mention of acute liver injury in the post-marketing experience. However, there is mention of a rare but serious progression to hepatic failure associated with ACE inhibitors in the ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" section. This could potentially encompass acute liver injury among other hepatic adverse reactions, but a direct relationship specific to acute liver injury is not explicitly supported based on the provided label sections. Additional evidence, such as peer-reviewed studies or case reports, would be required to better establish the relationship between lisinopril and acute liver injury. If such evidence exists beyond this provided label, it would need to be reviewed to offer a more comprehensive conclusion.",NA
acute liver injury,lomitapide,,"**Evidence Summary:**

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In a 78-week clinical trial conducted with 29 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), 34% (10 patients) experienced elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of at least three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). These elevations in liver enzymes are indicative of hepatocyte injury, which can be a precursor to acute liver injury. Additionally, hepatic fat, measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), increased significantly in those on lomitapide therapy, with a median absolute increase of 6% after 26 and 78 weeks of treatment. Increased hepatic fat can be associated with steatohepatitis and progression to more serious liver conditions such as cirrhosis.

**Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence:**
There have been reports of hepatotoxicity in patients taking lomitapide post-approval, although the exact frequency of these cases compared to the clinical trial setting is not available due to voluntary reporting and uncertainty around the actual size of exposed population.

**Warnings on Labeling:**
The drug label includes a boxed warning indicating the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with lomitapide. The label advises against the use of lomitapide in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease, including persistently elevated transaminases. Before and during treatment with lomitapide, transaminase levels should be regularly monitored, and the drug should be discontinued in the event of clinically significant liver toxicity.

**Evidence Synthesis:**
The relationship between lomitapide and acute liver injury is supported by evidence from a clinical trial that demonstrated significant ALT and AST elevations in patients treated with the drug, as well as increases in hepatic fat which is a known risk factor for liver injury. Postmarketing experience, although less quantifiable, aligns with these findings, showing occurrences of hepatotoxicity after lomitapide exposure. The seriousness of this potential adverse reaction is underscored by specific warnings and a boxed warning in the medication's labeling, which point out the risks of hepatotoxicity and provide guidelines for monitoring liver enzymes.

**Conclusion:**
There is clear and compelling evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance that suggests a causal relationship between lomitapide and acute liver injury, characterized by elevations in liver enzymes and increased hepatic fat deposition. The available data support the conclusion that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with lomitapide use. Health care providers should closely monitor hepatic function in patients taking lomitapide and follow the recommended guidelines to mitigate the risk of hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,lomitapide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and drug exposure to lomitapide (marketed as JUXTAPID) is derived from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings in the drug labeling. Here's a concise summary, citing the relevant sources:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In a 78-week clinical trial involving 29 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a condition for which lomitapide is indicated, the drug was associated with adverse hepatic effects. 10 of the 29 patients (34%) experienced at least one instance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels reaching greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Although no patients discontinued treatment due to elevated transaminases during the primary trial, one patient discontinued in the extension study due to increased transaminases that persisted after dose reductions. Another temporary discontinuation occurred because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN) possibly related to drug-drug interaction with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin (section 6.1).

Hepatic Steatosis:
JUXTAPID treatment was also shown to increase hepatic fat as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). After 26 weeks, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat from baseline was 6%, and the mean absolute increase was 8% (range, 0% to 30%). It is noted that while the accumulation of hepatic fat is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, the long-term histological consequences are not fully known (sections 6.1 and 5.1).

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label carries a boxed warning – the strongest warning issued by the FDA – regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity. This includes warnings about transaminase elevations and increased hepatic fat, which may be a risk factor for more serious liver diseases such as steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Due to these risks, JUXTAPID is only available through a restricted program known as the JUXTAPID REMS Program (sections WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY, 5.1, and 5.2).

Postmarketing Experience:
Postmarketing surveillance has identified additional adverse reactions, but the label specifically states that because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or definitively establish a causal relationship to JUXTAPID exposure. The postmarketing information does not specifically mention acute liver injury, indicating a lack of reported cases directly associated with the drug following its approval, or at least not at a frequency that would warrant inclusion in this section (section 6.2).

In summary, clinical trial data and strong warnings in the drug label support the relationship between lomitapide exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, characterized by elevated transaminases and hepatic steatosis. The evidence is drawn from trial results and is reinforced by an FDA-mandated risk management strategy due to the severity of these adverse effects.","NA

The provided label sections confirm that acute liver injury is a known risk associated with the use of lomitapide, which is explicitly stated under the warnings of hepatotoxicity risks. There is no evidence within the label to refute the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to lomitapide as hepatotoxicity is a significant concern noted in clinical trials and post-marketing experience."
acute liver injury,lorazepam,,"The evidence relating acute liver injury to lorazepam exposure is mentioned under the ""Adverse Reactions"" section of the drug label. It specifies that gastrointestinal symptoms, which include jaundice, increased in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, and increase in alkaline phosphatase, have been observed. Jaundice and the elevation of liver enzymes such as transaminases and alkaline phosphatase can be indicative of liver injury, including cases that may be acute and severe.

While the label does not provide specific details such as the frequency of acute liver injury occurrences or under what circumstances these adverse effects were noted (e.g., dosage, duration of treatment, patient demographics), the inclusion of these liver-related adverse reactions implies that there have been post-marketing reports or clinical observations that suggest a link between lorazepam use and potential hepatic injury. However, the label neither specifies the strength of this evidence nor provides a causal relationship.

In summary, the drug label for lorazepam does indicate that there have been adverse reactions affecting liver function, which can be suggestive of acute liver injury. However, without additional details from clinical trials, case studies, or robust post-marketing surveillance information, it is not possible to provide a precise evaluation of the risk or a clear understanding of the incidence and severity of acute liver injury associated with lorazepam. Further investigation through research literature or databases on drug safety might yield more comprehensive data regarding this potential adverse reaction. If such evidence were available, it would be necessary to evaluate the methodology and quality of the studies to offer a more conclusive summary.",NA
acute liver injury,lorlatinib,,"Based on the supplied drug label sections for lorlatinib (brand name LORBRENA), there is evidence of serious hepatotoxicity associated with its use, particularly when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A inducers. The following points summarize the key evidence:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1)**: The pooled safety data from two studies (Study B7461001 and Study B7461006) involving 476 patients exposed to lorlatinizumab included no specific mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction (≥20%). The reported Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities included elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides, but not liver transaminases.

2. **Serious Adverse Reactions (Sections 6.1)**: Across different patient populations (previously untreated and treated ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC) serious adverse reactions included pneumonia, dyspnea, cognitive effects, pyrexia, and more, but hepatotoxicity is not mentioned as a major concern in these sections.

3. **Laboratory Abnormalities (Sections 6.1, Tables 3 and 5)**: There is evidence of elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) which suggest hepatocellular injury. For example, in Study B7461001, Grade 3/4 increases in AST occurred in 2.1% and ALT in 2.1% of patients. Increased GGT, a marker for biliary and liver disease, was also notably elevated.

4. **Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity (Section 5.1)**: This section highlights that severe hepatotoxicity occurred in subjects receiving lorlatinib with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. Grade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50% of subjects, and Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations in 33%. These findings are critical as they directly link drug exposure to a significant risk of acute liver injury. However, it is essential to note this occurred in the context of a drug interaction with a strong CYP3A inducer.

In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not reported as one of the most common adverse reactions to lorlatinib, there is evidence to suggest that lorlatinib can cause severe hepatotoxicity, particularly when used in conjunction with strong CYP3A inducers. This is based on clinical trial observations and specifically highlighted in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label. Monitoring liver enzymes in patients taking lorlatinib, especially when concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers is present, appears to be a critical consideration based on the available evidence.",NA
acute liver injury,lovastatin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and lovastatin exposure emerges from various sources, including clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings outlined in the drug label. Here is a summary of the relevant data:

1. Clinical Trials:
   - In Phase III clinical studies with 613 patients treated with lovastatin, persistent increases of serum transaminases (liver enzymes) were noted, which is indicative of potential liver dysfunction (drug label).
   - The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) study with 8,245 patients also acknowledged clinical adverse experiences related to liver function, such as elevated transaminases, but the incidence was not statistically different between the lovastatin and placebo groups (drug label).

2. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - Gastrointestinal adverse reactions including hepatitis and, more rarely, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and hepatoma have been reported in the drug label's adverse reactions section.
   - The drug label includes warnings on liver dysfunction, advising monitoring liver enzyme levels before initiating treatment and periodically thereafter.

3. Boxed Warnings and Other Warnings:
   - The warnings section of the drug label emphasizes the importance of monitoring liver enzymes and indicates that lovastatin therapy should be temporarily or permanently discontinued if significantly elevated transaminase levels or signs of liver injury are observed.
   - Although not specific to liver injury, the label also describes other potentially related adverse reactions such as hepatitis and fatty changes in the liver.

Despite these reports, it is essential to note that the occurrence of serious liver injury is rare, and the clinical trials have not found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of liver-related adverse events compared to placebo. However, the inclusion of liver-related warnings and the requirement for enzyme monitoring indicate an acknowledged risk in association with lovastatin.

Overall, the summarized evidence suggests that there is a potential risk for acute liver injury with lovastatin use, highlighted by clinical study observations, post-marketing reports, and explicit warnings on the drug label. Healthcare providers are advised to monitor liver function in patients taking lovastatin to manage this risk effectively.",NA
acute liver injury,loxapine,,"The drug label provided for loxapine, an antipsychotic medication, does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. However, under the section titled ""Gastrointestinal,"" there is a mention of hepatocellular injury (elevated liver enzymes SGOT/SGPT) being reported in association with loxapine administration. Additionally, there is a note of rare instances of jaundice and/or hepatitis, although the relationship with loxapine treatment is deemed questionable.

Based on the information provided:

- **Clinical trials data**: There is no detailed evidence from clinical trials directly provided that specifically assesses the incidence of acute liver injury in loxapine-treated patients. 
- **Case studies and post-marketing surveillance**: The drug label mentions reports of hepatocellular injury, jaundice, and hepatitis in association with loxapine use. These instances seem to be derived from post-marketing surveillance as they are not attributed to data from controlled clinical trials. The qualification of the relationship being ""questionably related"" to loxapine treatment suggests that these reports may have been observed in patients taking loxapine, but a causal relationship has not been firmly established.

Overall, while there are mentions of liver-related adverse effects in the drug label, the evidence does not establish a definitive causal relationship between loxapine and acute liver injury. The mention of ""questionably related"" suggests that while there is some observed association, it is unclear whether loxapine is the direct cause of liver injury or if other confounding factors may be involved. The available evidence is derived from post-marketing reports, which inherently have limitations in establishing causality due to factors such as underreporting, lack of control groups, and potential concomitant medications or conditions in the reported cases. 

Further investigation, potentially through more rigorous pharmacovigilance studies or dedicated research, would be required to conclusively determine the relationship between loxapine and acute liver injury.","NA

The provided sections of the drug label for loxapine mention hepatocellular injury (e.g., SGOT/SGPT elevation) and, in rare instances, jaundice and/or hepatitis as potentially related to loxapine treatment. There is no specific evidence provided in these sections that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and loxapine exposure. Therefore, there is no available evidence to summarize that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and drug exposure to loxapine based on the product label information provided."
acute liver injury,lumateperone,,"As requested, I will summarize the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to lumateperone (CAPLYTA) based on the provided drug label sections.

According to the clinical trials experience reported in Section 6 of the drug label, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar depression were exposed to lumateperone at a daily dose of 42 mg. In the pooled short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled studies in adult patients with schizophrenia (N=406), the incidence of increased hepatic transaminases was recorded as an adverse reaction. The specific reported incidence was 2% in patients exposed to lumateperone at the mentioned dose, which was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.

Table 2 of the clinical trials experience indicates that increased hepatic transaminases (ALT, AST, “hepatic enzymes” increased, or liver function test abnormal) were noted, which hints at a potential relationship between lumateperone exposure and liver injury. However, the incidence appears to be low and it's not indicated whether these increases in liver enzymes were associated with acute liver injury or if they were transient and clinically insignificant enzyme elevations.

Moreover, the postmarketing experience section (6.2) mentions central and peripheral nervous system disorders as identified adverse reactions from post-approval use of lumateperone. Burning sensation, including skin burning sensation, is listed, but there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury in this section.

From the information provided, it can be concluded that there is some evidence from clinical trials of an association between lumateperone and liver enzyme elevation, which could suggest potential liver injury. However, the severity and the clinical significance of the liver enzyme alterations are not detailed. Additionally, there are no explicit reports in the provided sections of acute liver injury being a recognized adverse reaction in the postmarketing surveillance.

To establish a definitive relationship between lumateperone exposure and acute liver injury, more specific data would be needed, such as case reports detailing the clinical presentation of liver injury, its time course relative to lumateperone exposure, and resolution upon drug discontinuation, and relevant histological findings, if available. Without such information, the relationship between lumateperone and acute liver injury remains suggestive based on liver enzyme changes but not conclusively characterized.",NA
acute liver injury,lurbinectedin,,"The safety and adverse reaction profile of lurbinectedin (brand name ZEPZELCA) are reported in the drug label sections provided, which include references to clinical trials, specifically the pooled safety population from studies of 554 patients with advanced solid tumors and a cohort of 105 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from Study B-005. While hepatotoxicity is notably mentioned as a clinically significant adverse reaction in the label, acute liver injury is not explicitly stated. However, hepatotoxicity can encompass a range of liver-related injuries, including acute liver injury. 

Evidence from clinical trials (Section 6.1 of the drug label) indicates that increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were some of the most common adverse reactions observed, with increased ALT seen in 66% and increased AST in 26% of patients with SCLC. These elevations in liver enzymes can serve as markers for hepatic injury, including potential acute liver injury. Furthermore, the label details (Section 5.2) that among the 554 patients studied, Grade 3 and 4 elevations of ALT were observed in 6% and AST in 3% of patients, with Grade 4 elevations of ALT in 0.4% and AST in 0.5% of patients, respectively. The median time to onset of these elevations was around eight days. 

Post-marketing experience (Section 6.2) is another source of evidence but does not specifically mention acute liver injury. Generally, post-marketing surveillance can detect rarer adverse reactions not seen in clinical trials due to larger and more diverse populations being exposed to the drug over a longer time. However, these data are often self-reported and not as rigorously collected as in controlled trials.

In summary, while the drug label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury, evidence from the clinical trial data does indicate that lurbinectedin is associated with significant liver enzyme elevations that could signify potential liver injury, including acute liver injury. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests as recommended in the warnings and precautions underscores the recognized risk of hepatotoxicity with lurbinectedin treatment. To define the incidence and severity of acute liver injury specifically, more detailed investigations or dedicated studies would be required.",NA
acute liver injury,macitentan,,"The evidence supporting the association of acute liver injury with macitentan, marketed as OPSUMIT, comes from clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and recognized properties of its drug class, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs).

Clinical Trials:
The primary safety data regarding the hepatic effects of macitentan were obtained from the SERAPHIN clinical trial, which involved 742 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This placebo-controlled study identified an incidence of elevated liver aminotransferases in patients taking macitentan as follows (mentioned under Section 5.3 of the drug label):

- More than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN): 3.4% for OPSUMIT 10 mg versus 4.5% for placebo.
- More than 8 times ULN: 2.1% for OPSUMIT 10 mg versus 0.4% for placebo.

Moreover, there were more discontinuations for hepatic adverse events in the macitentan group (3.3%) compared to placebo (1.6%).

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-approval use of macitentan has further identified cases of liver injury. Some cases reported elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) and actual liver injury; however, in most of these cases, other potential causes were identified, such as heart failure, hepatic congestion, or autoimmune hepatitis. Despite these confounding factors, the post-marketing surveillance complemented the clinical trial data by reporting liver-related adverse effects in patients taking macitentan.

Drug Class Considerations:
It is also noted under Section 5.3 that endothelin receptor antagonists, the drug class to which macitentan belongs, have been associated with aminotransferase elevations, hepatotoxicity, and cases of liver failure, supporting the conclusion that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction to macitentan. Patients are advised to observe and report symptoms suggestive of hepatic injury, and the drug label recommends obtaining liver enzyme tests prior to and during treatment.

In summary, clinical trial evidence and post-marketing surveillance data, along with the known hepatotoxicity risk associated with ERAs, support the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to macitentan. The SERAPHIN trial provides a direct source of comparative data, while post-marketing experience offers real-world observations of liver injury in macitentan-treated patients.",NA
acute liver injury,macitentan,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and macitentan (marketed as OPSUMIT) primarily comes from the SERAPHIN clinical trial and post-marketing experience. Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**
According to the SERAPHIN study, a placebo-controlled trial involving 742 PAH patients, liver enzyme elevations were reported. The study illustrates:

- The incidence of aminotransferase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 3.4% in patients treated with OPSUMIT 10 mg, slightly lower than the 4.5% in the placebo group.
- Aminotransferase levels greater than eight times the ULN were reported in 2.1% of patients on OPSUMIT as opposed to 0.4% in the placebo group.
- Discontinuations due to hepatic adverse events were 3.3% with OPSUMIT 10 mg compared to 1.6% for placebo.
- Prior to initiating OPSUMIT and during treatment, liver enzyme tests are recommended to monitor for hepatotoxicity.

The clinical trial data indicates that while liver enzyme elevations were observed, the incidence was comparable to or slightly lower than what was seen in the placebo group, potentially suggesting other contributing factors.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
In the post-marketing setting, there have been reports of elevations in liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) and liver injury associated with macitentan use. However, these reports also note that in most instances there were alternative explanations for the liver injury, such as heart failure, hepatic congestion, or autoimmune hepatitis. Additionally, ERAs in general have been linked with liver enzyme elevations, hepatotoxicity, and cases of liver failure. Post-marketing data less controlled compared to clinical trials and relies on voluntary reporting, which does not always allow for reliable frequency estimation or establishment of a causal relationship.

**Conclusion:**
Based on evidence from the concerned clinical trial (SERAPHIN study) and post-marketing surveillance, there is an indication that macitentan might be associated with liver enzyme elevations and potential acute liver injury. However, the comparative nature of the liver enzyme elevations seen with both macitentan and placebo, along with the confounding factors reported in the post-marketing data, suggest that while there may be a risk, it may not be solely attributable to the drug. Health professionals are advised to monitor liver function as per the drug's safety label to mitigate and manage the risk of hepatotoxicity in patients taking macitentan. 

The evidence summarized above originates from OPSUMIT drug labeling from Janssen, including specific sections on adverse reactions (6.1), hepatotoxicity (5.3), and postmarketing experience (6.2).","Based on the provided drug label information for macitentan (Opsumit), there is evidence to suggest that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction of the medication. The label specifically mentions the association of endothelin receptor antagonists (the class of drugs to which macitentan belongs) with hepatic adverse events, such as elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and even cases of liver failure. In the clinical trial experience cited (the SERAPHIN study), there were instances of elevated liver enzymes greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in patients taking macitentar compared to placebo, and discontinuations due to hepatic adverse events were higher in the macitentan group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (1.6%). Additionally, post-marketing experiences have reported liver injury in patients using Opsumit, although other causes such as heart failure and hepatic congestion were also identified.

Given the available information, it is inaccurate to state that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction to macitentar; therefore, the answer ""NA"" (not applicable) is not appropriate in this context. The documented instances of liver injury and hepatotoxicity indicate that there is a relationship between acute liver injury and macitentan exposure.

acute liver injury,maraviroc,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence that supports the association between acute liver injury, characterized as hepatotoxicity, and drug exposure to maraviroc (marketed as SELZENTRY). The main points underscoring this relationship are as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Hepatotoxicity with allergic features, which could be life-threatening, has been reported in both clinical trials and postmarketing experiences with maraviroc.
   - Among reported cases of hepatitis, some were observed in the absence of allergic features or with no pre-existing hepatic disease.

2. Postmarketing Surveillance:
   - Hepatotoxicity has been identified as an adverse event during the post-approval use of SELZENTRY, encompassing a wide clinical spectrum from mild liver enzyme elevations to hepatic failure and jaundice.

3. Boxed and Other Warnings:
   - The drug label includes a boxed warning highlighting the risk of hepatotoxicity, indicating that this adverse reaction is serious enough to warrant this level of alert.
   - The label advises that liver function tests (LFTs) should be obtained before starting maraviroc and monitored during treatment, especially if rash or signs/symptoms of hepatitis or allergic reactions develop.
   - The label counsels that maraviroc should be discontinued in any patient with signs or symptoms of hepatitis or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms.

4. Warnings and Precautions:
   - Additional monitoring is recommended when administering maraviroc to patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction or those co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus.

These data suggest that there is a clear association between maraviroc exposure and the potential for acute liver injury. Healthcare providers prescribing maraviroc should be aware of this risk and proactively monitor patients' liver function before and during treatment, and promptly manage any signs of liver injury in accordance with the recommendations on the drug label. It is important to differentiate between hepatotoxicity associated with maraviroc and liver injury due to underlying conditions or other medications patients may be taking. 

The exact incidence and clinical characteristics of acute liver injury associated with maraviroc are not detailed in the provided sections and would require further scrutiny of available clinical data and postmarketing reports. However, the inclusion of hepatotoxicity as a boxed warning underscores its clinical significance.",NA
acute liver injury,mefenamate,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), there is evidence to suggest a relationship between mefenamic acid exposure and acute liver injury. Specifically, the drug label mentions:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: 
While the adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials cannot be directly compared to other drug trials or to rates in practice, liver-related adverse events are mentioned. Elevated liver enzymes are noted as a frequently reported adverse reaction, occurring in approximately 1 to 10% of patients taking mefenamic acid.

2. Adverse Reactions Reported Occasionally: 
The label lists hepatitis and jaundice as occasionally reported adverse reactions, which are indicative of liver injury.

3. Rare Adverse Reactions: 
Liver failure is listed among the rare adverse reactions to mefenamic acid. Although the incidence is not quantified in the label, its inclusion indicates that there have been reports of this serious liver event.

These insights from the drug label suggest that acute liver injury, characterized by events including elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, jaundice, and rare instances of liver failure, has been observed as an adverse reaction to mefenamic acid. These occurrences have been documented in various settings such as clinical trials, and also post-marketing, which includes less structured reporting such as case studies and post-marketing surveillance.

It is important to note that while the drug label indicates a relationship, it does not provide detailed information on the frequency or causality in post-marketing settings. Healthcare providers often rely on post-marketing surveillance (spontaneous reporting systems), published case reports, and case series to further understand the risks associated with drug exposure, particularly for rare adverse reactions. 

It should be noted that liver injuries from mefenamic acid, as with other NSAIDs, may be due to several factors including individual patient susceptibility, pre-existing liver conditions, concomitant medications, and over-dosage. The drug label warnings emphasize that these events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms, making monitoring and patient education crucial.

In conclusion, the evidence for a relationship between mefenamic acid exposure and acute liver injury is supported by clinical trial observations, occasional reports of hepatic side effects, and rare reports of liver failure, as stated on the drug label. However, for a complete assessment of the causality and incidence, further review of post-marketing data, biopharmaceutical databases, and published literature would be required.",NA
acute liver injury,mefloquine,,"Based on the information you provided from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the association between acute liver injury and mefloquine exposure, specifically under the category of hepatobiliary disorders. Here is a summary of the relevant evidence:

1. Laboratory Evidence:
   - Transient elevation of transaminases (enzymes released by the liver when it's damaged) has been reported in patients who received mefloquine. This suggests some form of liver involvement, although such elevations can stem from the underlying malaria as well.
   - During prophylactic administration to indigenous populations in malaria-endemic areas, similar transient elevations in liver enzymes were observed.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - Hepatobiliary disorders, ranging from asymptomatic transient transaminase elevations to hepatic failure, have been reported post-marketing. These cases indicate a spectrum of liver abnormalities associated with mefloquine use.

3. Warning Label:
   - The warning section of the drug label explicitly lists hepatic disorders as a potential adverse effect.

While there is an acknowledgment of hepatic disorders associated with mefloquine, the drug label suggests that at treatment doses for acute malaria, it is challenging to differentiate adverse reactions caused by the medication from symptoms of the disease itself. Furthermore, the relationship between liver injury and drug administration cannot always be reliably established due to the voluntary nature of adverse reaction reports after marketing and the fact that these events are often confounded by other factors.

It is important to note that the incidence rate and the direct causality of acute liver injury due to mefloquine are not concretely established in the provided label information. Therefore, while there are indications of liver-related adverse reactions, clinical trials or controlled studies specifically evaluating the direct causal relationship between mefloquine and acute liver injury were not explicitly mentioned.

In summary, there is post-marketing and laboratory evidence suggesting a possible relationship between mefloquine use and liver injury, which is recognized in the labeling of the drug. However, given the limitations in distinguishing adverse effects from disease symptoms and establishing causality post-marketing, more specific research may be necessary to fully understand the relationship.","NA

The summary and evaluation of the evidence requested cannot be provided as the adverse reaction in question, acute liver injury, is listed as an adverse event of mefloquine under ""Hepatobiliary Disorders: drug-related hepatic disorders from asymptomatic transient transaminase elevations to hepatic failure"" in the provided drug label information. Thus, there is an acknowledged relationship between mefloquine usage and the potential for hepatic adverse effects, which can include acute liver injury."
acute liver injury,meloxicam,,"Based on the provided drug label information for meloxicam, there is evidence supporting a relationship between meloxicam and the potential for acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity). Here are the relevant pieces of evidence summarized:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
While clinical trial data specifically mentioning acute liver injury are not provided in the extract, it mentions that hepatotoxicity is discussed in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.3), which suggests that concerns about liver-related adverse reactions were identified during the clinical trial evaluation of the drug.

2. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
The drug label states that some adverse reactions, including hepatitis and liver failure, have been reported during the post-approval use of meloxicam. These postmarketing reports further support the potential link between meloxicam and hepatotoxicity.

3. Warnings and Precautions - Hepatotoxicity (Section 5.3):
The drug label advises that elevations of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) have occurred in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials, and in some rare cases, severe liver injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, have been reported. This points to a known risk of liver injury associated with the use of meloxicam.

Patients are advised to watch for signs and symptoms of liver damage, and clinicians are instructed to discontinue meloxicam if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.

In conclusion, the relationship between meloxicam and acute liver injury is supported by details provided in the Warnings and Precautions section of the drug label, clinical trial experiences noting enzyme elevations, and postmarketing surveillance reports of serious liver-related adverse events. Healthcare providers are cautioned to monitor for signs of hepatotoxicity in patients taking meloxicam.",NA
acute liver injury,melphalan,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and melphalan exposure can be derived from the provided drug label sections. Specifically, the “ADVERSE REACTIONS” section of the label states that hepatic disorders, including abnormalities in liver function tests and clinical manifestations such as hepatitis and jaundice, have been reported. Additionally, it mentions hepatic veno-occlusive disease as a reported condition.

Although the section does not quantify the prevalence of acute liver injury nor distinguish between different types of liver injury, it is evident that there have been observed cases linking melphalan administration with hepatic adverse reactions. This information comes from post-marketing surveillance, which monitors the safety of a drug after it has been released on the market. Post-marketing reports are less controlled than clinical trial data but can indicate potential associations between a drug and adverse reactions in a broader patient population.

While the label provides insights into known adverse reactions from both oral and intravenous administration across various malignancies, it does not reference specific clinical trials or case studies that would provide a more detailed understanding of the relationship between melphalan and acute liver injury. The absence of specific data from clinical trials in the provided sections suggests that further investigation into published literature, clinical trial databases, or case reports would be necessary to determine the incidence, severity, and causality of acute liver injury related to melphalan use.

In summary, the drug label for melphalan indicates that hepatic disorders, including clinical manifestations associated with acute liver injury, have been reported in patients treated with the drug. This evidence comes from post-marketing surveillance data rather than controlled clinical trials or case studies. For a more detailed evaluation, additional literature review would be needed. It is also important to note that due to the nature of post-marketing data, causality cannot be definitively established, and these reports may not capture all cases or reflect the true risk.","NA

Based on the available sections of the drug label provided for melphalan, the information specifies that hepatic disorders, which include a range from abnormal liver function tests to the clinical manifestations such as hepatitis and jaundice, have been reported as adverse reactions. Furthermore, hepatic veno-occlusive disease is also listed in the gastrointestinal disturbance section as a reported adverse event. This indicates that hepatic adverse reactions, including acute liver injury, are recognized as potential consequences of melphalan exposure and are documented as such in the prescribing information.

No evidence has been presented here that refutes the established relationship between melphalan exposure and the risk of hepatic adverse reactions, including acute liver injury. If contrary evidence exists, it would typically come from peer-reviewed studies, meta-analyses, clinical trials, or large-scale observational studies, none of which have been provided in the given drug label excerpt."
acute liver injury,memantine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for memantine hydrochloride, acute liver injury is not listed among the most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than placebo) observed in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The common adverse reactions included dizziness, headache, confusion, and constipation. These trials involved a total of 1,862 dementia patients and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were similarly distributed between the treatment and placebo groups (10.1% and 11.5%, respectively).

In the section detailing post-marketing experience, which collects voluntary reports of adverse reactions from a population of uncertain size, hepatitis is noted as an adverse reaction. However, acute liver injury is not specifically mentioned. Hepatitis can be associated with liver injury, but it is important to distinguish between different types and severities of liver damage. There is no explicit mention of acute liver injury or detailed cases that allow for a clear establishment of a causal relationship between memantine exposure and acute liver injury.

While hepatitis could be considered a form of liver injury, without further evidence such as the frequency of reports, detailed case studies, or clinical data demonstrating a direct causal relationship between memantine and acute liver injury, it cannot be conclusively determined that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction to memantine based solely on this label information.

No box warnings related to liver injury are present in the provided label, which further suggests that such an adverse reaction is not well-established or recognized as a significant risk associated with memantine hydrochloride based on current evidence.

In conclusion, the provided drug label does not provide sufficient evidence to establish acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction to memantine hydrochloride. The mention of hepatitis in the post-marketing experience does not equate to comprehensive evidence of acute liver injury, and there is not enough detailed information to draw a direct causal link. Further research, including case studies and monitoring, could provide more insight into this potential relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,mercaptopurine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and mercaptopurine exposure is articulated in several sections of the drug's label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
Under the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section (6.1), the label states that based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, less common adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients include increased transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia, which are indicators of liver injury. Additionally, delayed or late adverse reactions include hepatic fibrosis and hyperbilirubinemia.

2. Warnings and Precautions:
Section 5.2, titled ""Hepatotoxicity,"" highlights the hepatotoxic nature of mercaptopurine. Reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with mercaptopurine administration are mentioned, indicating that severe hepatic injury, including acute liver injury, can arise from the drug's use. The label mentions that clinically detectable jaundice, a sign of liver damage, can appear between 1 week and 8 years after starting treatment with mercaptopurine, emphasizing that liver injury can occur at any point during therapy. Additionally, hepatotoxicity has been linked to symptoms such as anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, and ascites, and severe cases have led to hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Though not specifically listed in the provided sections, post-marketing surveillance may also contribute to understanding the risk of adverse reactions, including hepatotoxicity, as healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions (as stated in section 6).

Moreover, the ""WARNINGS"" section advises monitoring liver function through serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels, which further supports the concern for liver injury due to mercaptopurine. The drug label notes the necessity of withholding the medication at the onset of hepatotoxicity, reflecting the serious nature of liver injury risk associated with mercaptopurine usage.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trial data and the outlined warnings within the drug label clearly indicate that acute liver injury is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to mercaptopurine. These findings are derived from clinical trial observations, reported adverse reactions indicating hepatic dysfunction (such as increased transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia), and post-marketing surveillance that captures real-world experiences with the drug.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, is clearly listed as a potential adverse reaction to mercaptopurine. As such, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and mercaptopurine exposure. The label indicates that hepatotoxicity has been observed and is associated with the administration of mercaptopurine, with instructions to monitor liver function tests and to withhold the drug at the onset of hepatotoxicity."
acute liver injury,meropenem,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and meropenem use is not directly stated in the adverse reactions or warnings sections of the drug label provided. However, meropenem's impact on liver function can be inferred from several points within the label:

1. Clinical Trials:
During clinical trials of 2904 adult patients treated with meropenem, adverse laboratory changes of hepatic origin were noted, including increased alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin. While these changes indicate an effect of meropenem on liver enzymes, they do not specifically describe acute liver injury.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
In the postmarketing experience section, there is a mention of hepatic failure occurring but without specific incidence rates or a clear causal relationship established due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the uncertain size of the population exposed.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
The label does list various potential adverse reactions including jaundice and hepatic failure in the warnings and precaution sections, implying that liver-related events can occur.

4. Pediatric Patients:
For pediatric patients (neonates and infants less than 3 months of age), hyperbilirubinemia was reported. This might suggest an association with liver dysfunction, but it's not directly indicative of acute liver injury.

To summarize, while there is mention of hepatic enzyme elevation and a few cases of hepatic failure, the label does not provide conclusive evidence tying acute liver injury specifically to meropenem use. Elevated liver enzyme levels can be indicative of liver injury, but whether those represent an ""acute"" injury or something of a more minor or chronic nature is not clear from the drug label information presented. Additional research and case studies, which are not mentioned in the label, would be necessary to draw a more direct correlation between meropenem and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,mesalamine,,"Based on the provided drug label information, the evidence on the relationship between acute liver injury and mesalamine exposure comes from post-marketing surveillance.

The adverse reactions section of the label does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse event (>0.1% occurrence) in patients treated with mesalamine in comparison to placebo during clinical trials. The adverse reactions mentioned mostly include gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, flu-like symptoms, skin reactions, and other non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness. Liver injury is not explicitly mentioned in the section detailing common adverse reactions.

However, in the section regarding post-marketing experience, it is noted that there have been instances of elevated liver enzymes reported. Elevated liver enzymes can be an indication of liver injury or damage. The label specifies that these adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mesalamine, which is based on voluntary reports from a patient population of uncertain size, and hence the frequency of occurrence is not reliably estimable.

There is no indication from the section of the label provided that clinical trials directly observed acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction to mesalamine. Instead, it is in the postmarketing phase where such effects on the liver are reported. Additionally, the label suggests a lack of a firmly established causal relationship to mesalamine exposure due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

It is important to note that post-marketing surveillance can sometimes be the first hint of a rare adverse event not captured in clinical trials. These reports are valuable for ongoing pharmacovigilance but must be interpreted with caution as they can be influenced by reporting bias and do not have the controlled conditions of a clinical trial.

In conclusion, while there is not strong evidence from clinical trials suggesting a relationship between acute liver injury and mesalamine, the mentioning of elevated liver enzymes in the post-marketing experience section indicates that there have been observations of liver-related issues potentially associated with mesalamine use. However, the evidence does not allow for a precise estimate of frequency or a definite causal relationship due to the nature of post-marketing reporting.",NA
acute liver injury,metformin,,"The provided drug label information on metformin, a medication primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in clinical trial data. The most frequently encountered adverse reactions in the clinical trials for the extended-release tablets of metformin (greater than 5%) were gastrointestinal in nature, including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache.

However, postmarketing experience, which includes data collected after a drug has been approved and is in widespread use, has identified instances of cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury in patients taking metformin. It is important to note that these reports come from a voluntary system and that it is challenging to accurately determine their frequency or confidently establish a causal relationship to metformin exposure.

Despite these reported instances of liver injury, the label emphasizes that lactic acidosis is a more significant risk associated with metformin, especially in patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or other risk factors mentioned in the label. Lactic acidosis is a serious, though rare, complication that can result from metformin accumulation.

To summarize, while acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse effect of metformin in clinical trials, there have been postmarketing reports of liver injury. However, these are voluntary reports with unclear frequency and causality. The greater concern with metformin usage, as per label warnings, is the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in certain vulnerable populations.

Source: The provided sections of the drug label for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.",NA
acute liver injury,methazolamide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and the use of methazolamide is suggested by the mention of ""hepatic insufficiency"" within the adverse reactions section of the drug label. Hepatic insufficiency can encompass a variety of liver dysfunctions, including acute liver injury. Additionally, the drug label specifies ""fulminant hepatic necrosis"" as a rare but severe reaction to sulfonamides, which are a class of medications that include methazolamide. Fulminant hepatic necrosis is a form of acute liver failure which could be interpreted as the most severe form of acute liver injury.

While the adverse reactions section of the label does not use the specific term ""acute liver injury,"" the inclusion of hepatic-related terms implies that such a reaction is possible. Being a part of the sulfonamide class of drugs, the shared adverse reactions and warnings suggest a potential for acute liver injury.

However, to provide a thorough evaluation, it would be necessary to review clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports for more specific evidence of methazolamide-induced acute liver injury. This could include instances of elevated liver enzymes, hospitalizations due to liver injury, and any reported fatalities where methazolamide was implicated in acute liver damage.

Since the specifics of clinical trial data, individual case studies, and post-marketing surveillance details are not provided here, it is impossible to comment on their existence or contents in relation to acute liver injury caused by methazolamide. It is important to rely on peer-reviewed studies, clinical trial data, case reports, and post-marketing analyses to establish a stronger causative link.

It is also important to note that drug labels may evolve as more data becomes available. Therefore, healthcare professionals should refer to the most current drug label and literature for up-to-date information on drug-associated adverse reactions. For further clarification, one should consult the drug's manufacturer, healthcare authorities, or databases that track adverse drug reactions such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).",NA
acute liver injury,methohexital,,"The adverse reactions section of the drug label for BREVITAL, the brand name for methohexital, mentions 'liver function tests abnormal' as one of the potential gastrointestinal side effects. This indicates that there have been instances where methohexital administration is associated with alterations in liver enzymes, which could suggest a potential for acute liver injury. However, the label does not provide specific details about the incidence, mechanism, or severity of liver injury.

Clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance are crucial sources of evidence to investigate the relationship between drug exposure and liver injury. Clinical trials often provide initial safety data, whereas case studies can document specific instances of adverse reactions, and post-marketing surveillance collects data from a broader population over a more extended period.

In this case, since the drug label itself does not offer comprehensive evidence regarding the incidence of acute liver injury directly associated with methohexital, we would look to published clinical trials, peer-reviewed case studies, or data from post-marketing surveillance for further evidence. However, without external sources provided here and no specific cases or studies referenced in your inquiry, it is not possible to determine whether there is a well-documented causal relationship between methohexital and acute liver injury based solely on the drug label information.

To provide a precise and specific conclusion, one would need to review available clinical research databases, journal articles reporting case studies where methohexital was implicated in acute liver injury, and any reports from databases that track post-marketing surveillance such as the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System or internationally recognized pharmacovigilance organizations.

As the expert summary stands based upon the information provided, it can only be definitively stated that abnormal liver function tests are listed as an adverse reaction in the drug label for methohexital, which may imply a risk for acute liver injury. Detailed evidence regarding the strength of this relationship is not available in the given data. Health professionals who detect such adverse effects are encouraged to report these instances to pharmacovigilance agencies to build a stronger evidence base through post-marketing surveillance data.",NA
acute liver injury,methotrexate,1.0,"The drug label for methotrexate indicates hepatotoxicity as a clinically significant adverse reaction, as well as providing explicit warnings and precautions regarding the potential for liver injury. Below is a summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and methotrexate exposure:

- **Clinical Trials**: In clinical trials involving patients with rheumatoid arthritis, elevated liver tests were reported in 15% of patients who received methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg orally once weekly. Liver histology was not examined in these short-term studies, and most patients were also taking concomitant medications like NSAIDs and corticosteroids, which may also affect liver function.

- **Postmarketing Experience**: Hepatotoxicity, including reports of acute hepatitis, decreased serum albumin, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, has been identified during the postapproval use of methotrexate. However, the spontaneous nature of voluntary reports makes frequency estimates and the establishment of a causal relationship difficult.

- **Label Warnings and Precautions (5.5)**: The labeling cautions that methotrexate can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure. The risk is described as increased in the presence of pre-existing liver disease, alcohol use, and with cumulative doses (especially after a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g or more). It advises monitoring liver tests at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. The label suggests withholding or discontinuing methotrexate in the event of significant hepatotoxicity.

This evidence indicates a well-documented risk of acute liver injury associated with methotrexate use, which is supported by data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the pharmacological understanding of the drug's potential to cause liver damage. Healthcare providers are advised to monitor liver function closely in patients receiving methotrexate and manage the therapy according to the individual benefit-risk profile.",NA
acute liver injury,methyldopa,1.0,"Evidence supports a relationship between methyldopa exposure and acute liver injury, which is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to this medication. Here is a summary of the relevant evidence:

1. **Drug Label Information**: The drug label for methyldopa under the ""WARNINGS"" section states liver disorders, including hepatitis and jaundice, can occur as well as abnormal liver function tests. This is a direct acknowledgment from the manufacturer that hepatic dysfunctions are an identified risk associated with the use of methyldopa.

2. **Clinical Trials**: While specifics from clinical trials are not provided here, the inclusion of hepatic issues such as hepatitis in the ""WARNINGS"" section suggests that evidence from clinical trial data has shown a connection between methyldopa use and liver injury.

3. **Case Studies**: Although specific case studies are not listed in the information provided, the recognition of adverse liver reactions in the ""WARNings"" section indicates there have likely been documented cases of liver injury related to methyldopa. Case reports in medical literature have historically been sources that signal potential adverse reactions, particularly hepatotoxicity induced by drugs.

4. **Post-marketing Surveillance**: The drug label mentions adverse reactions have been reported, which implies post-marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance efforts have detected instances of liver injury post-commercial release of the drug. This type of surveillance is designed to detect, assess, and understand adverse effects that may only become apparent when a drug is used in a wider population over longer periods than in clinical trials.

5. **Hepatic Adverse Reaction Details**: The label detail specifies hepatitis and jaundice, conditions which denote significant liver impairment, and also refers to abnormal liver function tests. These may include elevated liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels, which are common indicators of liver injury.

Given this information, it is evident that there is a documented risk of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to methyldopa, recognized through clinical data and post-marketing experiences, which is serious enough to warrant a warning on the drug label. Additional detailed evidence from research studies could provide further data on the incidence, risk factors, and mechanisms of methyldopa-induced liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,methylene blue,,"The summary of evidence related to acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to methylene blue, specifically in the form of the product PROVAYBLUE, is based on the sections of the drug label provided.

The key section mentioning liver-related adverse reactions states ""elevated liver enzymes"" under the subsection reporting on other adverse reactions that have been reported with methylene blue class products. This suggests that there is some association between methylene blue exposure and liver enzyme elevations, a potential indicator of acute liver injury. However, the label does not provide specific details regarding the incidence rate, the severity of liver injury, or the context in which the enzyme elevations were noted (e.g., concomitant medications, patient conditions, dosing, duration of treatment).

The evidence is derived from the following sources as described in the drug label:
1. Clinical Trials Experience: Safety assessed in 31 adults with acquired methemoglobinemia, which mentions serious adverse reactions occurred in 3.2% of patients, specifically a seizure-like phenomenon, but acute liver injury is not mentioned.
2. Retrospective Case Series: Safety profile in pediatric patients similar to adults, but no specific mention of acute liver injury.
3. Post-marketing Surveillance: Includes other adverse reactions reported with methylene blue class products, where elevated liver enzymes are listed as an investigation finding.

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no detailed evidence or specific discussion of clinical trials, case studies, or clinical context that directly and robustly supports a definitive causal relationship between methylene blue (PROVAYBLUE) and acute liver injury. The mention of ""elevated liver enzymes"" does indicate the potential for liver-related effects but without context or detailed supporting data from the aforementioned clinical sources.

It is notable that the drug has warnings for conditions like serotonin syndrome when used with certain drugs and for hypersensitivity reactions, among other safety concerns. However, these are not directly related to liver injury.

In conclusion, while there may be some indication of a potential for liver-related adverse effects (elevated liver enzymes) from post-marketing surveillance, the provided information from the drug label lacks sufficient detail to establish a clear causal relationship with acute liver injury from the use of methylene blue (PROVAYBLUE). Further detailed evidence, such as from controlled clinical trials or case studies with clear causality assessments, would be needed to conclusively determine the relationship between methylene blue exposure and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,methylphenidate,,"The provided drug label information for methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets includes a range of potential adverse reactions and warnings related to its use. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned in the commonly observed adverse reactions section (6.1) or the other adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (6.2). Acute liver injury is typically a severe condition characterized by a rapid onset of liver damage that can lead to liver failure.

In the post-marketing experience section (6.5) of the label, there are reports of hepatobiliary disorders, including hepatocellular injury and acute hepatic failure. Post-marketing surveillance includes data collected after a drug has been released on the market and can provide additional information on rare or delayed adverse effects that were not detected during clinical trials due to the limited size and duration of these studies.

The direct reference to hepatocellular injury and acute hepatic failure in the post-marketing experience suggests that there is evidence to support a relationship between methylphenidate exposure and acute liver injury, albeit these are likely rare events. It's important to note that post-marketing reports are based on voluntary reporting from patients and healthcare providers, so it can be challenging to determine the exact incidence and establish a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse events.

Therefore, while the drug label does not mention acute liver injury as a common reaction in controlled clinical trials, post-marketing data does indicate that it can occur and warrants consideration when assessing liver-related symptoms in patients taking methylphenidate. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risks and may require monitoring patients' liver function as part of the overall safety evaluation when prescribing this medication. It is also essential to report any suspected adverse reactions to appropriate drug safety surveillance programs to further assess the risk.",NA
acute liver injury,metoclopramide,,"The drug label for metoclopramide provides information related to various adverse reactions associated with the drug's use. However, we are specifically interested in the evidence supporting the relationship between metoclopramide exposure and acute liver injury.

The relevant section on Hepatic Disorders from the label states that hepatotoxicity, which includes jaundice and altered liver function tests, has been noted when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs known for their hepatotoxic potential. This suggests a possible association between metoclopramide and liver injury, particularly in combination with other hepatotoxic drugs. It does not definitively establish a causal relationship between metoclopramide alone and acute liver injury.

To further evaluate the connection between acute liver injury and metoclopramide use, we would need to look into any reported clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that specifically investigate this adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials:
The label does not provide detailed information on clinical trials that exclusively focus on the hepatotoxic effects of metoclopramide. Clinical trials are structured studies in human volunteers to answer specific health questions and can provide robust evidence when examining drug safety, but the lack of detailed trial information on this specific concern limits our understanding.

Case Studies:
Case studies are detailed reports of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of an individual patient with a particular condition. Reports of hepatotoxicity potentially linked to metoclopramide may exist but are not explicitly mentioned in the provided label information. A review of medical literature is necessary to identify any documented case studies in this context.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing surveillance is an important tool for understanding the safety profile of a drug after it has been released to the market. Adverse reactions like hepatotoxicity associated with metoclopramide may emerge in these reports. However, the drug label indicates that because these reactions are voluntarily reported, it is often challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a precise causal relationship to drug exposure.

In summary, the drug label for metoclopramide hints at hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction when used with other known hepatotoxic drugs, but it lacks specific evidence to conclusively establish a direct causal association between metoclopramide and acute liver injury. It's important to investigate additional sources such as clinical trials, case studies, and further post-marketing reports to get a stronger understanding of this potential adverse reaction. Without more direct evidence, it cannot be conclusively stated that metoclopramide alone causes acute liver injury. If additional information from these sources is available, a more informed assessment can be made.",NA
acute liver injury,metronidazole,,"The evidence for a relationship between acute liver injury and metronidazole exposure can be gleaned from several sources specified in the drug label's adverse reactions section:

1. **Hepatic Adverse Reactions Mentioned on the Drug Label**: The label explicitly mentions cases of severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure, including cases with fatal outcomes with very rapid onset after initiation of systemic use of metronidazole. These cases have been observed particularly in patients with Cockayne syndrome. However, the frequency of occurrence is not provided, which suggests these reports may come from post-marketing surveillance or case studies rather than controlled clinical trials.

2. **Latency Period**: The adverse hepatic effects have been reported to show a latency from drug initiation to signs of liver failure as short as 2 days. This rapid onset suggests a strong temporal relationship between metronidazole use and the development of liver injury in these cases.

3. **Contradictions and Warnings**: The fact that acute liver failure is mentioned in both the ""Contraindications"" and ""Hepatic"" subsections implies that there have been clinician-verified reports of such reactions that warrant attention. However, no specific clinical trials or epidemiological studies are cited to quantify the risk.

There is no mention of acute liver injury in the context of large-scale clinical trials or systematic reviews within the label excerpt provided. The evidence seems to be based on post-marketing reports and specific population observations (patients with Cockayne syndrome). Post-marketing surveillance is valuable for identifying rare adverse effects that may not have been detected in clinical trials due to sample size limitations or shorter follow-up periods. But without access to specific case reports or post-marketing data, it is not possible to determine the incidence, risk factors, or mechanisms of metronidazole-induced acute liver injury in the general population.

In summary, the provided sections of the drug label indicate that there have been reports of acute liver injury associated with metronidazole exposure, especially in patients with underlying conditions such as Cockayne syndrome. However, these findings are likely derived from case reports and post-marketing surveillance rather than from systematic clinical trials. A detailed review of the literature, including case reports and post-marketing studies, would be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the evidence supporting this relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,mexiletine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for mexiletine, there is mention of abnormal liver function tests being reported in postmarketing experience, which implies that some patients have experienced liver-related issues while on the drug. However, the drug label does not specifically categorize acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials. The label does highlight rare cases of severe hepatitis/acute hepatic necrosis, suggesting that there have been instances where a potential link between mexiletine and serious liver injury might exist.

The details in the label indicate that the exact relationship between mexiletine and liver injury has not been fully determined. The mention of some abnormal liver function tests ""in the first few weeks of therapy"" implies that there could be a temporal relationship between the drug exposure and the liver test abnormalities. However, these observations are noted in the context of patients with congestive heart heart failure or ischemia, making it difficult to establish a direct causative relationship solely to mexiletine due to the presence of confounding factors.

The mention of this adverse effect is provided under the section outlining postmarketing experience, which is typically derived from case reports, spontaneous reporting systems, and longitudinal surveillance after the drug is approved and marketed. This type of information is useful for identifying potential risks not captured in clinical trials, which may have limited sample sizes or durations that do not reveal rarer or longer-term effects.

In conclusion, while there is an indication of liver-related adverse effects in patients taking mexiletine from postmarketing surveillance data, including abnormal liver function tests and rare cases of severe hepatitis/acute hepatic necrosis, the evidence does not stem from clinical trials. Furthermore, causal attribution is not firmly established. Clinicians should monitor liver function tests in patients taking mexiletine, especially in the initial phase of therapy and in those with pre-existing cardiac or liver conditions. Additional studies or case assessments would be required for a definitive understanding of the relationship between mexiletine exposure and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,micafungin,,"**Summary of Evidence: Acute Liver Injury and Micafungin Use**

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
The drug label for micafungin summarizes data from clinical trials, which report liver test abnormalities among participants. Specifically, in a trial for candidemia and other Candida infections, 6% of patients in the micafungin 100 mg/day group experienced increased blood alkaline phosphatase, a possible marker of liver injury. Additionally, in another trial for the same conditions, 4% of patients reported abnormal liver tests. In the context of esophageal candidiasis treatment, abnormalities are less quantified but report liver test abnormalities as well. The label warns of ""hepatic effects"" noting that laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients treated with micafungin. These effects include isolated cases of significant hepatic impairment, hepatitis, and hepatic failure.

**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
The post-marketing experience section of the drug label includes reports of hepatic disorders identified after the approval of micafungin. It is noted, however, that due to the nature of voluntary reporting from an uncertain size population, it is challenging to estimate the frequency of these reports or establish a causal relationship to micafungin exposure.

**Warnings and Precautions Section:**
Label section 5.3 specifically addresses hepatic effects, advising monitoring for liver function tests during micafungin treatment. It acknowledges reported cases of clinical hepatic abnormalities, significant hepatic impairment, hepatitis, and hepatic failure in some patients—implying a potential link between micafungin and hepatic adverse reactions.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and micafungin comes from clinical trial data, where abnormal liver tests and other markers of potential liver injury were observed, as well as from post-marketing surveillance reporting hepatic disorders. The drug label includes explicit warnings to monitor liver function during treatment with micafungin due to the potential for hepatic adverse reactions, including severe conditions such as hepatic failure. However, the causality is not definitively established, and a careful assessment of the risk/benefit is advised when considering the continuation of therapy in the presence of such adverse effects.",NA
acute liver injury,milrinone,,"Based on the information provided from the relevant sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) of the drug label for milrinone lactate, there is no direct evidence linking acute liver injury specifically to the administration of milrinone in the context of clinical trials. The adverse reactions documented from Phase II and III clinical trials predominantly concern cardiovascular and CNS effects, with ventricular arrhythmias being the most common cardiovascular adverse reaction reported.

In terms of liver-related adverse effects, the drug label mentions “liver function test abnormalities” in the post-marketing experience section but does not specify acute liver injury. Liver function test abnormalities can encompass a range of liver issues and are not necessarily indicative of acute liver injury. These post-marketing reports are less controlled and often less detailed than data from clinical trials, making it difficult to ascertain causality or the frequency of such reactions.

Therefore, based on the available information, there is a mention of liver function test abnormalities in the post-marketing surveillance of milrinone, but there is no clear evidence from clinical trials explicitly associating milrinone with acute liver injury. Further investigation, such as reported case studies or additional research, would be required to establish a more definitive relationship between milrinone exposure and the risk of acute liver injury. Since no specific cases or studies were provided in your query, it is not possible to elaborate further on this potential adverse reaction. It is important for healthcare providers to report suspected adverse reactions to appropriate channels, such as the contact provided on the drug label or through the FDA's MedWatch program, to contribute to the body of evidence and improve drug safety monitoring.",NA
acute liver injury,minocycline,,"**Evidence Summary:**

The relationship between acute liver injury and minocycline use is supported by multiple sources as highlighted by the drug's label. Evidence includes observations in clinical settings and post-marketing surveillance reports.

**Clinical Trials and Observations:**
While clinical trials are not explicitly mentioned in the provided label sections for minocycline's association with acute liver injury, it lists hepatic toxicity, including hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, and increases in liver enzymes as observed adverse reactions. Fatal hepatic failure and jaundice are also explicitly mentioned, providing direct evidence of severe liver injury associated with the drug.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The label indicates that hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported based on post-marketing surveillance. These reports are particularly significant because they are less likely to be limited by the controlled conditions of a clinical trial and may provide a broader view of the drug's effects in the general population.

**Specific Cases:**
The label also includes a reference to instances of acute liver failure which have occurred in association with minocycline, highlighting severe outcomes that have arisen as a result of exposure to the drug.

**Summary:**
Based on the adverse reactions section of the drug label provided, there is evidence from post-marketing reports and observed adverse reactions that suggests a relationship between minocycline exposure and acute liver injury, including severe manifestations such as hepatic failure and jaundice. It is important to note that while the evidence comes from observed cases and post-marketing reports rather than controlled clinical trials, these data points still contribute to understanding the risk profile of minocycline. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the FDA, indicating an ongoing process of evidence collection and surveillance regarding minocycline's safety profile.

It is important for healthcare providers to monitor patients taking minocycline for signs of liver injury and to report any adverse effects to regulatory authorities to aid in the continued tracking of the drug's safety.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is listed as a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of minocycline. Specifically, the label mentions hepatic toxicity, including hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported. Therefore, it cannot be stated that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of minocycline; the evidence in the drug label supports the relationship between minocycline and potential liver injury."
acute liver injury,mirtazapine,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in the sections provided from the drug label for mirtazapine. However, the drug label does mention ""Transaminase Elevations"" under the Warnings and Precautions (5.13). Transaminase elevations are indicative of changes in liver enzymes, which can be a marker of liver injury.

Here is a summary of the evidence related to liver injury as an adverse reaction to mirtazapine from the sections provided:

1. Clinical Trial Experience (6.1): Transaminase elevations were observed in 2.0% (8/424) of patients in a pool of short-term, U.S. controlled trials, compared to 0.3% (1/328) of placebo patients.
2. Postmarketing Experience (6.2): While the postmarketing experience does not explicitly mention acute liver injury, cases of ""Transaminase Elevations"" suggest that some individuals may experience liver-related adverse effects after market release.
3. Warnings and Precautions (5.13): Clinically significant elevations of ALT (SGPT), which is a liver enzyme, have occurred in patients treated with mirtazapine. This could suggest some degree of liver injury, although the clinical significance of these findings is not clearly stated beyond the recommendation of caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.
4. Digestive System Adverse Reactions: Infrequent adverse reactions include abnormal liver function tests, but there is no mention of acute liver injury.

There is no explicit evidence from the sections provided that directly correlates mirtazapine with acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. It is noteworthy, however, that postmarketing surveillance and clinical trials have noted transaminase elevations, which may be relevant to liver function. The label advises caution in prescribing mirtazapine to patients with impaired hepatic function, suggesting recognition of potential liver-related issues.

If more detailed information on hepatic adverse events is required, a thorough review of the medical literature, clinical trial data, and postmarketing surveillance reports beyond the drug label would be necessary to determine if there is documented evidence of acute liver injury specifically related to mirtazapine use.","NA

Based on the provided excerpt from the drug label for mirtazapine, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction. However, ""Transaminase Elevations"" are noted (Section 5.13), indicating that there have been instances of clinically significant elevations in liver enzymes, which can be an indication of liver injury. Patients are advised to use mirtazapine with caution if they have impaired hepatic function. It's important to note that while acute liver injury per se is not specified, liver-related adverse effects have been observed and reported. Therefore, a statement refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and mirtazapine cannot be made without a review of further evidence beyond the provided label information."
acute liver injury,modafinil,,"**Summary of Evidence: Acute Liver Injury and Modafinil Use**

The provided drug label for modafinil does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in the controlled clinical trial experience. However, laboratory abnormalities, including higher mean plasma levels of gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), were observed following the administration of modafinil tablets, although most patients did not have elevations outside the normal range. There is a mention of ""abnormal liver function"" in 2% of modafinil-treated patients, which may suggest hepatic changes, though the label does not specify the nature or severity of these abnormalities (Section 6.1).

The section on multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions mentions that there have been cases with associated hepatitis and liver function test abnormalities (Section 5.3). This could imply that modafinil has the potential to cause liver injury as part of a multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction, although it is infrequent and unpredictable. The median time to detection of these multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions, which potentially could include acute liver injury, was 13 days (range 4-33 days).

Postmarketing surveillance is identified as another source of evidence, where adverse reactions are voluntarily reported. However, acute liver injury is not specifically mentioned in this context (Section 6.2).

Therefore, while there is an indication of potential liver-related effects associated with modafinil use, such as higher levels of GGT and AP and a mention of abnormal liver function in a small percentage of patients, the evidence on acute liver injury specifically is limited and not well-characterized in the provided label. Further investigation into postmarketing data and case studies would be needed to better establish the relationship between acute liver injury and modafinil use, and it is crucial to consider individual patient risk factors and the clinical context when evaluating these potential adverse effects.",NA
acute liver injury,monomethyl fumarate,,"Evidence regarding the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury associated with monomethyl fumarate is derived from clinical trials data, post-marketing surveillance, and the drug label information provided by the manufacturer which mentions liver injury as an area of concern.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
Monomethyl fumarate (BAFIERTAM) has a prodrug, dimethyl fumarate, from which the majority of clinical trial data is derived. Adverse liver effects observed in clinical trials include an increased incidence of hepatic transaminase elevations (specifically alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) seen primarily during the first six months of treatment with dimethyl fumarate. Most elevations were less than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Elevated hepatic transaminases ≥3 times ULN occurred in a small number of patients treated with dimethyl fumarate and were balanced between those receiving the active drug and those on placebo. There were no elevations in transaminases ≥3 times the ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin >2 times ULN. Discontinuations due to elevated hepatic transaminases were less than 1% for both the active treatment and placebo groups.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
In the post-marketing setting, liver function abnormalities (elevations in transaminases ≥3 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin >2 times ULN) have been reported for dimethyl fumarate. Clinically significant cases of liver injury, some necessitating hospitalization, with initiation of treatment ranging from a few days to several months have also been observed. These liver abnormalities resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.

Label Information:
The drug label advises routine monitoring of liver function tests due to the potential risk of liver injury. It recommends evaluating serum aminotransaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels before initiation of monomethyl fumarate (BAFIERTAM) and during treatment, as clinically indicated. The label also suggests that if clinically significant liver injury suspected to be induced by BAFIERTAM is identified, the treatment should be discontinued.

Overall, the evidence suggests an association between monomethyl fumarate (and its prodrug, dimethyl fumarate) and the potential for liver injury, including acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. This is supported by clinical trial data, post-marketing reports, and recommendations on the drug label for monitoring liver function and discontinuing the medication in the event of liver injury.","NA

The provided drug label sections for BAFIERTAM (monomethyl fumarate) and its prodrug dimethyl fumarate do indicate hepatic side effects, such as elevated hepatic transaminases. However, the label explicitly states that there were no elevations in transaminases ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times the ULN, which are criteria for diagnosis of acute liver injury. Therefore, according to the provided label information, acute liver injury is not identified as an adverse reaction of monomethyl fumarate."
acute liver injury,montelukast,,"Acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to montelukast is supported by post-marketing experience rather than from results directly observed in clinical trials. The clinical trials section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) of the provided drug label does not list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, which were identified in patients treated with montelukast in controlled clinical trials and observed at a rate higher than placebo. Instead, the most common adverse reactions included upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, and others, with some laboratory adverse reactions such as increased ALT and AST levels indicating potential liver enzyme elevation.

Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience describes adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium, which are not necessarily reported with the same frequency or established with a solid causal relationship due to the voluntary nature of these reports. It is within this section that hepatic eosinophilic infiltration is mentioned along with cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury, which have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Importantly, these cases were often associated with other factors that confound clear attribution to montelukast alone, such as the use of other medications or existing potential for liver disease like alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis.

The label emphasizes the difficulty in reliable estimation of frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary and diverse population size.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not cited as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials, the post-marketing experience suggests that montelukast sodium has been associated with liver injuries that could include acute liver damage. However, due to confounding factors, a direct causal relationship remains uncertain. 

Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor patients for signs of liver dysfunction and evaluate the risk-benefit ratio, particularly in patients with existing liver conditions or those using other hepatotoxic medications.","NA

Based on the provided label sections for montelukast, acute liver injury is listed as a potential adverse drug reaction seen in post-marketing experience with montelukast. Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported, although these were noted to occur often in conjunction with other factors that may confound the relationship, such as the use of other medications or pre-existing liver diseases such as hepatitis or alcohol use.

Because acute liver injury is specifically mentioned in the postmarketing experience section of the drug's label as an adverse reaction associated with montelukast, it indicates that there is at least some evidence supporting a relationship between montelukast and acute liver injury. There are no sections provided that refute the relationship between acute liver injury and montelukast exposure, so it is not possible to provide evidence refuting this relationship based on the drug label information presented."
acute liver injury,morphine,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to morphine use. The adverse reactions outlined in the drug label sections relevant to morphine chiefly involve the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, respiratory system, and potential for substance abuse, among others. Common adverse reactions include drowsiness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, and anxiety, with more serious adverse reactions such as life-threatening respiratory depression, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants.

The post-marketing experience reports conditions such as serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, anaphylaxis, androgen deficiency, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, among others. Hypoglycemia has also been noted as a reported condition in patients, particularly with predisposing risk factors such as diabetes.

Despite the variety of adverse reactions and warnings associated with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, acute liver injury is not cited in the sections provided. Therefore, within the scope of this drug label information, there is no available evidence to support a relationship between morphine use and acute liver injury.

Should more specific studies or case reports regarding morphine and acute liver injury exist outside of this provided information, a search of medical literature databases and safety surveillance databases would be required to identify and summarize such evidence. However, the current summary is based solely on the prescribing information provided, which does not indicate a known association between morphine exposure and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,moxifloxacin,,"Acute liver injury is an identified adverse reaction to the administration of moxifloxacin. This relationship is supported by evidence from post-marketing surveillance, as detailed in the drug's labeling:

**Postmarketing Experience of Hepatobiliary Disorders:**
- Hepatitis (predominantly cholestatic)
- Hepatic failure (including fatal cases)
- Jaundice
- Acute hepatic necrosis

These adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and as such, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure definitively.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
In the provided section on clinical trials (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience), the evidence of acute liver injury is not explicitly detailed. Clinical trials involving 14,981 patients in Phase II to IV did not result in a notable incidence of acute liver injury prominent enough to be distinguished in the summarized adverse reactions. The trials monitored adverse reactions such as increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, which can be indicators of liver injury, but the summary did not link these laboratory changes directly to acute liver injury.

**Importance of Surveillance:**
Despite the lack of detailed incidence rates of acute liver injury in clinical trials, the postmarketing reports clearly acknowledge that such adverse reactions can and have occurred. Given that these reports are based on voluntary submissions, the true incidence and direct causal relationship might be underreported or not fully established through this mechanism.

**Warnings and Precautions (Sections 5.7 and 5.8):**
The warnings and precautions section also acknowledges severe adverse reactions that may be linked to liver injury, advising immediate discontinuation of moxifloxacin at the first appearance of symptoms indicating hepatic dysfunction, such as jaundice. This suggests that although rare, the potential for severe liver injury is recognized and is a concern during treatment with moxifloxacin.

In summary, evidence from postmarketing surveillance supports the relationship between acute liver injury and moxifloxacin use, as documented in the adverse reactions section of the drug label (Table 4: Postmarketing Reports of Adverse Drug Reactions). The exact frequency and mechanism of this adverse reaction are less clear due to the nature of reporting and the absence of acute liver injury as a prominent feature in the succinct results of clinical trials presented in this label.","NA

The provided drug label sections clearly list hepatic failure, hepatitis, jaundice, and acute hepatic necrosis as possible adverse reactions associated with moxifloxacin in the postmarketing experience (Table 4 under section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience). Therefore, acute liver injury is indeed recognized as a potential adverse reaction of moxifloxacin, and there is no evidence refuting this relationship."
acute liver injury,mycophenolate mofetil,,"Acute liver injury is a serious condition that can arise from drug exposure, including the use of mycophenolate mofetil (brand name CellCept), which is an immunosuppressive drug often used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. The provided drug label sections contain extensive information about the clinical trials, adverse reactions, and post-marketing experiences with mycophenolate mofetil, but do not specifically mention acute liver injury as a documented adverse reaction.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
The clinical trials detailed in the label included several studies with adult patients who received CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants like cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The adverse reactions with a frequency of 20% or greater included diarrhea, leukopenia, infection, and vomiting. Data from these trials for the liver transplant study group indicate some liver-related adverse reactions, such as increased levels of hepatic enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase. However, acute liver injury was not specifically reported as a common adverse reaction within these trials.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
The adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of CellCept are listed under the post-marketing surveillance section. Here, the label cites several serious adverse reactions, including hematologic issues such as bone marrow failure and pure red cell aplasia, gastrointestinal complications like colitis and pancreatitis, and a range of infections. Additionally, hepatobiliary disorders are mentioned but are limited to increased enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase, without a clear indication of acute liver injury being a recognized consequence of CellCept use.

**Summary:**
Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking mycophenolate mofetil with acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. However, post-marketing data does mention hepatobiliary disorders, suggesting there may be liver-related concerns that could encompass various levels of liver injury or dysfunction. For a conclusive determination on the relationship between CellCept and acute liver injury specifically, further investigation into scientific literature, case reports, and more detailed post-marketing data would be necessary. If such data are available, they were not included in the provided text. Therefore, it is recommended to consult additional sources or databases to assess whether more recent studies or reports have found a direct association.",NA
acute liver injury,mycophenolic acid,,"The drug label for mycophenolic acid provides comprehensive information regarding its safety profile, including common and rare adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing experience. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions in the sections provided.

From the clinical trials section (6.1), the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were graft loss, diarrhea, vomiting, renal impairment, CMV infection, and leukopenia. Moreover, other adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients include anemia, leukopenia, various gastrointestinal complaints, infections, and others. Liver function abnormalities are mentioned under the investigations subsection, but this does not explicitly qualify as acute liver injury.

In the post-marketing experience (6.2), various adverse reactions have been identified with the use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets or other mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivatives. Adverse reactions include serious gastrointestinal complications, infections, and hematological disorders, among others. The phrase 'liver function tests abnormal' is present, hinting at potential liver-related issues but not specifying acute liver injury.

Warnings and precautions sections (5.1 to 5.12) detail risks associated with mycophenolic acid, including infections, blood dyscrasias, gastrointestinal complications, and others. However, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury in these sections either.

In summary, based on the label sections provided, there is mention of abnormal liver function tests but no explicit reference to acute liver injury as an adverse reaction from the use of mycophenolic acid. Should acute liver injury be a recognized adverse reaction, it might be listed in a more detailed part of the label or other scientific literature that was not provided. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and up-to-date data sources for comprehensive safety information on mycophenolic acid.",NA
acute liver injury,nabumetone,,"Based on the provided drug label information, evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to nabumetone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is limited but present. In the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the nabumetone label, hepatic failure is reported as an adverse event that is ""probably causally related"" to nabumetone, although its incidence is less than 1% based on US clinical trial data. Additionally, liver function abnormalities and jaundice are listed under the same ""probably causally related"" category but also with an incidence of less than 1%. These findings were observed in patients who received nabumetone during US clinical trials ranging from 1 month to more than 5 years of treatment. 

Furthermore, the label mentions ""hepatic failure"" specifically. This term typically refers to significant impairment of liver function, which can be a severe form of acute liver injury. Since ""hepatic failure"" is italicized, this suggests that such adverse reactions were reported in post-marketing experience or literature, which indicates that these findings were not commonly seen in the controlled environment of clinical trials but were observed once the drug was available on the market and used by a wider population.

The evidence for acute liver injury associated with nabumetone derives from post-marketing surveillance and documented case reports, which typically have lower levels of evidence compared to randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, these reports are valuable and are taken into consideration by regulatory agencies due to the wide use of the drug post-approval, which can reveal rare but serious adverse events.

It is important to also note that the label includes warnings about the general risks of NSAIDs, such as an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, although these are not directly related to liver injury. There are no box warnings specifically for hepatic adverse effects, but the drug label clearly acknowledges the potential for serious gastrointestinal risks, which are a known class effect of NSAIDs.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that there is a probable but low incidence relationship between nabumetone and acute liver injury, with the supporting data emanating from post-marketing surveillance reports and clinical trial observations. The manufacturer's label illustrates that while the occurrences are rare, health care providers should be aware of the potential for serious liver-related adverse reactions when prescribing nabumetone. This information guides monitoring practices and informs clinicians and patients about the potential risks associated with the drug's use.",NA
acute liver injury,nadolol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nadolol, there is mention of elevated liver enzymes as a potential adverse reaction in the ""Gastrointestinal"" subsection under the broader category of ""ADVERSE REACTIONS."" However, the label clearly states that no causal relationship to nadolol has been established for this observation.

The categories of adverse reactions are typically organized as follows:
1. Most commonly reported adverse effects that have been observed and are considered related to the drug.
2. Adverse reactions reported with nadolol but for which a direct causal relationship to the drug has not been established.

Acute liver injury is a severe form of liver damage but is not explicitly listed as a known adverse reaction to nadolol in the label provided. Instead, elevated liver enzymes, which can be a marker of liver injury, are mentioned. The occurrence of elevated liver enzymes suggests that there might be instances of hepatic stress or damage associated with the drug, but without clear causal attribution.

Since clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance are not detailed in the provided label sections, it is not possible to offer a detailed summary of those specific sources of evidence regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and nadolol exposure. Typically, this information would be required to establish a definitive link or to provide a more robust evidence base.

To summarize:
- Elevated liver enzymes have been reported in patients taking nadolol among other beta-adrenergic blocking agents; however, a direct causal link to the drug nadolol has not been definitively established as per the provided drug label information.
- Acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse event in the provided sections of the drug label for nadolol, although liver-related effects are mentioned.
- Without further evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, it is not possible to confirm or rule out acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically attributed to nadolol.

For conclusive evidence, it would be necessary to consult full clinical trial data, case reports, or extensive post-marketing surveillance reports, which might provide a clearer indication of the risk and incidence of acute liver injury specifically associated with nadolol usage.","NA

The evidence provided does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and nadolol exposure because acute liver injury is listed under the gastrointestinal section of the adverse reactions as ""elevated liver enzymes."" Elevated liver enzymes can be indicative of liver injury. While the label states that a causal relationship to nadolol has not been established, the mention of this adverse reaction indicates that there have been reports of it occurring. The absence of evidence refuting the relationship means that acute liver injury cannot be definitively excluded as a potential adverse reaction of nadolol; thus, NA (not applicable) is the appropriate response."
acute liver injury,nafarelin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nafarelin (Synarel), there is no direct mention or specific evidence linking nafarelin to acute liver injury in the discussed adverse reactions, warnings, or post-marketing surveillance. The information given does not detail acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, case studies, or through post-marketing surveillance.

However, the label does mention that during clinical trials, plasma enzymes such as SGOT and SGPT were more than twice the upper limit of normal in one patient each, without further clinical or laboratory evidence of abnormal liver function. The levels returned to normal after treatment stopped, which could suggest a possible transient effect of the drug on the liver enzymes but does not establish acute liver injury.

Additionally, under post-marketing surveillance, the label notes rare reports of ""serious liver injury."" No specifics are provided regarding the nature of these liver injuries, their severity, or the evidence supporting a causal relationship with nafarelin. The term ""serious liver injury"" can encompass various conditions, including acute liver injury, but without detailed evidence, a link to nafarelin cannot be confidently asserted.

To summarize, the provided label does not yield clear evidence to support the conclusion that nafarelin causes acute liver injury. It does, however, indicate rare cases of serious liver injury reported during post-marketing surveillance without concrete details that would allow for the establishment of a causal relationship. Further investigation, such as evaluation of case reports or additional studies, would be required to determine whether there is a more definitive association between nafarelin and acute liver injury. If more detailed information becomes available or is sought after, the evidence could be re-evaluated.",NA
acute liver injury,nafcillin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and nafcillin exposure can be indirectly inferred from the drug label information provided, specifically from the section on hepatic reactions. While the label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury, it does indicate that *elevation of liver transaminases and/or cholestasis* may occur, especially with the administration of high doses of nafcillin. Elevation of liver enzymes is a common indicator of liver injury, and cholestasis can lead to liver damage.

The association with high doses suggests that the hepatic adverse effects may be dose-dependent, which aligns with the known hepatotoxic potential of certain medications. As for the specific source of evidence, the drug label typically reflects data gathered from clinical trials, as well as post-marketing surveillance that includes spontaneous reports of adverse events and case studies.

However, without detailed information on specific clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing reports directly linking nafcillin to acute liver injury, it is challenging to provide a precise summary of the evidence. This information may exist in the medical literature or databases of adverse drug reactions but is not detailed in the provided drug label excerpt.

Therefore, the drug label implies a potential for liver-related adverse effects with nafcillin administration, but it does not offer explicit evidence regarding acute liver injury. Professional judgment and further investigation into the medical literature and databases, such as peer-reviewed articles or the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), would be necessary to provide a more detailed analysis of the evidence surrounding acute liver injury specifically associated with nafcillin exposure.","NA
"
acute liver injury,naltrexone,,"Acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction to the drug naltrexone, as evidenced by various studies and observations noted in the drug label information provided.

1. **Clinical Trials**: In placebo-controlled studies, hepatocellular injury was identified as a significant concern when naltrexone was administered at doses five times higher than recommended for opioid blockade (300 mg per day). Specifically, in a study with obese subjects, 19% (5 out of 26) developed elevated serum transaminase levels—markers indicative of liver injury—after three to eight weeks of treatment with high-dose naltrexone. These levels returned to baseline after the cessation of treatment. Furthermore, similar hepatic enzyme elevations were observed in other trials, indicating a consistent pattern of hepatotoxicity at higher dosages.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: The label acknowledges that hepatocellular injury can occur and emphasizes the need for monitoring liver function tests. The post-marketing data indicate that most adverse events associated with naltrexone occur early in the treatment and are typically transient. However, specific incidence rates of liver injury from the provided post-marketing data are not detailed, making it difficult to gauge the frequency or severity of such events amidst the general population.

3. **Case Studies**: The label does not provide direct case study references for liver injury related to naltrexone use. However, the acknowledgment of transaminase elevations in clinical studies suggests that clinical case observations have supported the findings to some extent.

To summarize, while the recommended dose of nitaltrexone (50 mg daily) for alcohol dependence appears to be generally well-tolerated, there is evidence to suggest that naltrexone can cause hepatocellular injury, primarily at higher doses than that recommended for treating opiate dependence or alcoholism. Liver function abnormalities are not necessarily common at standard dosing, but healthcare providers should closely monitor patients for any signs of liver dysfunction, especially if higher doses are used. The data especially point towards a dose-related hepatotoxicity risk, necessitating careful consideration of the dosing regimen and close monitoring of liver function tests during treatment with naltrexone.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for naltrexone, there is evidence that high doses of naltrexone—specifically, doses approximately five times higher than those recommended for treating alcoholism or opioid blockade—can cause hepatocellular injury. This is reflected in the increased incidence of elevated serum transaminases observed in a placebo-controlled study with obese subjects receiving 300 mg per day of naltrexone. However, the label does not provide evidence refuting the relationship between naltrexone at recommended doses and acute liver injury; rather, it indicates that such adverse reactions can occur at higher doses. Therefore, evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and naltrexone at the recommended dosages is not available within the information provided."
acute liver injury,naproxen,1.0,"Evidence linking acute liver injury to naproxen use is documented in the provided drug label under the warnings and post-marketing experience sections. 

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- There is no direct evidence from the provided sections of clinical trials that explicitly links naproxen to acute liver injury, but elevations of liver enzymes and other liver function tests have been reported.

Case Studies:
- The drug label does not provide specific case studies, but it mentions rare cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, which have been reported.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- The drug label indicates that hepatitis and abnormal liver function tests have been identified as adverse reactions during the post-approval use of naproxen.
- Hepatitis, some cases of which have been fatal, is listed under the postmarketing adverse reactions, indicating that there have been instances where naproxen exposure was associated with liver damage after the drug was released into the market.

The drug label advises informing patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and suggests discontinuation of the drug if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.

In summary, while randomized controlled clinical trials do not provide direct evidence of acute liver injury due to naproxen, post-market surveillance data and individual case reports have documented instances of hepatotoxicity, including serious conditions such as hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Therefore, there is evidence supporting a relationship between naproxen exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, warranting caution and monitoring for hepatic adverse effects during naproxen therapy.",NA
acute liver injury,nateglinide,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials data of patients treated with nateglinide. The clinical trials involving approximately 2,600 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with nateglinide have documented adverse reactions such as upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, flu symptoms, dizziness, arthropathy, and diarrhea, in addition to hypoglycemia and weight gain, but acute liver injury is not listed among these reactions.

However, hepatobiliary disorders, including jaundice, cholestatic hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes, have been identified as adverse reactions during the post-marketing experience of nateglinide. These conditions can be indicators of acute liver injury, but it is important to note that this information comes from voluntary reports post-approval, which means the frequency of these conditions and the establishment of a causal relationship to nateglinide exposure are not as well-defined as they would be through controlled clinical trial data.

The reported post-marketing adverse reactions suggest that there have been instances where a relationship between nateglinide and acute liver injury has been observed, but a definitive confirmation of the frequency of such adverse reactions or the establishment of a direct causal link would require further investigation, which may include additional research studies or more rigorous post-marketing surveillance.

Therefore, while there is some evidence from post-marketing reports suggesting a potential relationship between nateglinide and acute liver injury, the evidence from clinical trials does not support this association, and the information is not included in the ""Adverse Reactions"" or the ""Warnings and Precautions"" sections of the drug label. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to monitor liver enzymes and assess patients for symptoms of liver injury during treatment with nateglinide. Patients should also be advised to report any symptoms that could indicate liver problems, such as jaundice or severe fatigue.","NA

The available evidence provided in the drug label does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and nateglinide; rather, it indicates that hepatobiliary disorders such as jaundice, cholestatic hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes have been reported during post-marketing experience. This implies that there have been instances where nateglinide may be associated with liver-related adverse effects."
acute liver injury,nefazodone,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and nefazodone exposure is primarily found in postmarketing surveillance data, as indicated by the warning section of the nefazodone hydrochloride tablets label.

Clinical Trials:
Within the clinical trials section of the provided label, there are no direct mentions of liver injury as a commonly observed adverse effect. Adverse effects such as nausea, dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, constipation, asthenia, and others are mentioned with varying frequencies, but hepatic issues are not specifically highlighted in this context.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
Postmarketing experience has revealed cases of life-threatening hepatic failure in patients treated with nefazodone hydrochloride as stated in the warning section. The reported incidence rate of liver failure resulting in death or transplant in the United States is estimated at approximately 1 case per 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years of treatment with nefazodone.

It is important to note that acute liver injury is a serious adverse event and can lead to liver necrosis, liver failure, transplantation, or death. Due to these risks, the drug label advises against initiating treatment with nefazodone in individuals with active liver disease or elevated baseline serum transaminases. Additionally, it is recommended that nefazodone be discontinued if clinical signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction arise.

Moreover, patients who develop hepatocellular injury, such as increased serum AST or ALT levels to ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal while on nefazodone, should discontinue the drug and are advised not to be re-treated with it due to the increased risk of liver injury upon reintroduction.

The strength of evidence from postmarketing surveillance, while less controlled than clinical trials, is significant enough to warrant clear warnings and contraindications regarding the use of nefazodone in patients with liver issues.

In summary, while clinical trial data does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a common adverse effect of nefazodone, postmarketing surveillance data has provided evidence of a relationship between nefazodone exposure and serious hepatic events. This evidence has prompted strong warnings within the drug labeling information and has influenced clinical recommendations for the monitoring of liver function and cautious use of nefazodone in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or elevated liver enzymes.",NA
acute liver injury,nelfinavir,,"The available evidence for the relationship between acute liver injury and nelfinavirus (VIRACEPT) exposure is sourced from the drug's label, including adverse reactions, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance data. It is important to note that while the provided sections of the label report various adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction.

From the provided information, under the ""Digestive System"" heading in the adverse events section for adults and adolescents (6.1), hepatitis is mentioned as an event occurring in less than 2% of patients and considered at least possibly related to treatment, which might suggest a hepatic adverse event. Additionally, under the laboratory abnormalities (Table 5), it is noted that during the clinical trials, there were infrequent marked abnormalities in liver enzymes such as ALT (SGPT) and AST (SGOT), which could be indicative of liver injury or dysfunction in a small percentage of patients.

Post-marketing experience (6.3) also lists jaundice and bilirubinemia, which are clinical indicators of liver dysfunction, but it is specified that a causal relationship to drug exposure can not be reliably estimated due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertain size of the affected population.

In the ""Hepatic Impairment"" warning (5.2), VIRACEPT is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, implying that there is an association between the drug and potential worsening of pre-existing liver conditions.

In summary, while overt acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse event in the sections provided, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that nelfinavir can be associated with hepatic side effects, such as hepatitis, liver enzyme abnormalities, jaundice, and bilirubinemia, which suggest a potential for liver injury in rare cases. However, the causal relationship is not definitively established, and the frequency of such events appears to be low based on the available data.",NA
acute liver injury,neratinib,,"Evidence of the Relationship Between Acute Liver Injury and Neratinib Exposure:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
Clinical trials have documented hepatotoxicity as a possible adverse reaction to neratinib. In the ExteNET trial, a study of NERLYNX (neratinib) in early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer patients post-adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab, 10% of patients experienced an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of more than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN), 5% experienced an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of more than two times the ULN, and 1.7% experienced an AST or ALT increase greater than five times the ULN, which is consistent with Grade 3 or higher hepatotoxicity.

In the NALA study, in patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine for metastatic breast cancer, it was documented that 7% experienced an ALT or AST increase greater than three times the ULN, 2% experienced an increase greater than five times the ULN, 7% experienced a bilirubin increase more than 1.5 times the ULN, and 1.3% experienced a bilirubin increase greater than three times the ULN.

Hepatotoxicity led to drug discontinuation in 1.7% of neratinib-treated patients in the ExteNET study and in 0.3% of patients treated with neratinib plus capecitabine in the NALA study.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label advises monitoring liver function tests for the first three months of treatment and then every three months while on treatment or as clinically indicated, which suggests a recognition of potential drug-induced liver injury post-marketing. However, precise post-marketing surveillance data is not provided in this documentation.

Box Warnings and Precautions:
The labeling indicates hepatotoxicity as a warning and precaution, with instruction to monitor liver function tests periodically and specific actions to be taken if grades 3 or 4 abnormalities are observed, such as withholding or permanently discontinuing neratinib.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials (ExteNET and NALA) indicates a clear association between neratinib treatment and increased liver enzyme levels, suggesting acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction. This is reflected in the drug's labeling under warnings and precautions.",NA
acute liver injury,niacin,1.0,"There is evidence supporting the relationship between niacin (nicotinic acid) and acute liver injury. Liver injury from niacin typically appears in the context of its use at pharmacologic doses, such as those used to manage dyslipidemia. 

1. **Clinical Trials**: Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated a small but significant increase in the incidence of liver function test abnormalities with the use of therapeutic doses of niacin. Furthermore, these trials have documented cases of significantly elevated transaminases, which are indicative of liver injury. For instance, in trials comparing niacin with statin treatment, there was a higher incidence of hepatotoxicity in the niacin groups.

2. **Case Studies**: Numerous case reports have linked the use of high-dose niacin with acute liver injury. These reports detail patients who developed symptomatic liver disease with elevated liver enzymes and, in some cases, jaundice. In many of these instances, the liver injury resolved upon discontinuation of niacin, suggesting a direct relationship.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Post-marketing reports continue to reflect the clinical trial data and case reports, confirming the association of niacin with hepatic adverse effects. Liver-related adverse reactions have been recorded, ranging from asymptomatic transaminase elevations to fulminant hepatic failure.

Although the exact mechanism of niacin-induced hepatotoxicity is not fully understood, it is thought to be dose-dependent and potentially related to the metabolism of niacin in the liver. The risk might be higher with prolonged-release formulations.

It should be noted that liver injury from niacin is normally associated with high doses (>1-2 grams per day) and not typically seen at the lower doses used to supplement the diet. The information you've provided does not mention acute liver injury specifically, but abnormalities in liver function tests are referenced under the ""Gastrointestinal"" section. While the label sections you've included do not directly state ""acute liver injury,"" abnormal liver function tests are a known indicator of potential liver injury, and jaundice is a clinical sign of significant liver impairment.

It is worth mentioning that due to the risk of serious side effects such as liver injury, the use of niacin for cholesterol management has become less common, especially since newer lipid-lowering agents with better safety profiles are now available.

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance that supports the relationship between niacin at pharmacologic doses and acute liver injury. When prescribing niacin, healthcare providers should consider these risks and monitor liver enzyme levels to ensure patient safety.","NA

The adverse reaction section of the drug label provided includes jaundice and abnormal liver function tests, which are both indicative of liver injury. Despite the instructions, given that these reactions are listed under the ""Adverse Reactions"" section of the drug label, they are recognized outcomes associated with niacin exposure and would not be appropriate for providing evidence refuting the relationship. Therefore, the statement 'NA' (not applicable) is provided since the adverse reaction is recognized to be related to the drug."
acute liver injury,nilotinib,,"Evidence of Acute Liver Injury Associated with Nilotinib:

Clinical Trials:
- Hepatotoxicity has been documented as a clinically significant adverse reaction in patients treated with nilotinib (Tasigna), and these findings are described in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.6) of the drug label.
- In a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), Grade 3/4 elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed and are reported in Table 9. Bilirubin elevations are also noted.
- For pediatric patients, Grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia (16%) and transaminase elevation (AST Grade 3/4: 2.9%, ALT Grade 3/4: 10%) occurred at a higher frequency than in adults, indicating more pronounced hepatotoxicity in this group.
- Clinical adverse reactions of hepatotoxicity are listed as common events in clinical trials (section ""Additional Data From Clinical Trials"").

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Postmarketing experience noted hepatotoxicity as a reported adverse reaction following nilotinib use. However, the frequency of these occurrences is not well established due to the voluntary nature of such reports.

Overall, clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance information support a relationship between nilotinib exposure and acute liver injury, including elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Grade 3/4 cases, which are considered severe, were also observed, reflecting the potential seriousness of hepatotoxicity associated with this drug. Healthcare professionals should closely monitor hepatic function in patients receiving nilotinib, as outlined in the drug label's recommendations.","NA

The provided label sections document that hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes, is a known adverse reaction associated with the use of nilotinib (Tasigna). The label clearly states that monitoring hepatic function is advised and that liver function tests should be checked monthly or as clinically indicated. Therefore, there is evidence that acute liver injury is considered to be an adverse reaction to nilotinib, contradicting the task of refuting this relationship."
acute liver injury,nintedanib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and nintedanib (OFEV) exposure primarily comes from clinical trial data and post-marketing experience.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
1. **Clinical Trials Experience:** Adverse reaction rates related to liver enzyme elevation have been reported in clinical studies. Specifically, the label mentions liver enzyme elevation in 14% of nintedanib-treated patients versus 3% in the placebo group during trials in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Table 1).
2. **Elevated Liver Enzymes and Drug-Induced Liver Injury:** The label describes observed cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including severe liver injury with fatal outcomes reported in the post-marketing period. It is highlighted that these events mainly occurred within the first three months of treatment. The liver enzyme and bilirubin increases were reversible with dose modification or interruption in a majority of cases.
3. **Hepatic Impairment:** Nintedanib is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and requires a dosage adjustment in patients with mild hepatic impairment. This caution indicates recognition of the drug's potential impact on liver function.

**Specific Data Points from Clinical Studies:**
- In IPF studies, 94% of patients with elevated ALT and/or AST had values less than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and 95% of patients with elevated bilirubin had less than twice ULN elevations.
- For patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype, 95% of those with elevated liver enzymes had values less than five times ULN.
- In the systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) study, ALT and/or AST greater than or equal to three times ULN was observed in 4.9% of nintedanib-treated patients versus 0.7% in the placebo group.

**Post-marketing Experience:**
Following approval, non-serious and serious cases of DILI were reported, and a few severe liver injuries resulted in fatalities. These post-marketing reports provide real-world evidence linking nintedanib exposure to liver injury, supplementing the clinical trial data.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences indicating that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction associated with nintedanib. This is reflected in the drug label's Warnings and Precautions, which advises monitoring liver function tests before and during treatment and suggests possible dose modifications or discontinuation in the event of liver enzyme elevation.",NA
acute liver injury,nintedanib,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The drug label for nintedanib (OFEV) indicates that elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are clinically significant adverse reactions identified during clinical trials (Section 6.1). In the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) studies (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), the label reports that 14% of the patients receiving nintedanib experienced liver enzyme elevation compared to 3% in the placebo group, suggesting a notable increase in hepatic enzyme abnormalities associated with the drug. Additionally, serious adverse events of bronchitis and myocardial infarction were more frequently reported in the OFEV-treated group than with placebo, and the section on arterial thromboembolic events indicates that myocardial infarction occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with nintedanib vs. less than 1% of placebo-treated patients.

In the chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5), as well as the systemic sclerosis-associated ILD study (Study 4), liver enzyme elevation was reported at a higher incidence in the nintedanib group compared to placebo (13% vs. 3% and 13% vs. 3%, respectively). The section on hepatic impairment (5.1, 5.2) further describes the occurrence of ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations during trials and highlights the need for careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments due to hepatic events, mostly occurring within the first three months of treatment.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Section 6.2 of the drug label provides postmarketing experience data which is collected from a wider patient population in a real-world setting post-approval. It mentions non-serious and serious cases of drug-induced liver injury, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, reported after OFEV was approved and made available to the general population. The postmarketing data underscore the association between nintedanib and acute liver injury, corroborating evidence from clinical trial experiences.

Warnings and Precautions in the Label:
The label's Warnings and Precautions section (5.2) specifically addresses the risk of elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury, with a note that severe liver injury with fatal outcomes has occurred post-approval. It underscores the reversibility of liver enzyme and bilirubin increases with appropriate dose modification or interruption in the majority of the instances. This section reinforces the label's assertion that there is an evidence-based relationship between nintedanib and acute liver injury by describing recommended monitoring intervals and procedures to follow in cases of liver enzyme elevation.

Summary:
The relationship between acute liver injury and nintedanib usage is supported by data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Elevated liver enzymes were a relatively common adverse reaction in nintedanib-treated patients across various studies. Serious cases of DILI, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in the postmarketing period. The drug label reflects this evidence, warning healthcare professionals to monitor liver function tests closely before and during nintedanib treatment and providing guidance on handling abnormal results.",NA
acute liver injury,nisoldipine,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, there is no direct evidence to suggest that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction specifically associated with the use of nisoldipine.

In the sections mentioned from the drug label, nisoldipine is reported to have been involved in a variety of adverse reactions in clinical trials involving more than 6000 patients worldwide. Adverse events listed were those typically associated with the vasodilatory properties of the drug, such as peripheral edema and dizziness, and a few less common and more serious conditions. Within the ""Digestive"" category, ""abnormal liver function tests"" is mentioned. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions observed.

Regarding post-marketing surveillance, the drug label provides an account of systemic hypersensitivity reactions but does not mention acute liver injury as a reported condition. Although abnormal liver function tests are noted within the clinical trial observations, these do not necessarily indicate that there is direct evidence of acute liver injury causally connected to nisoldipine.

To draw a conclusion on the absence of evidence, the provided drug label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Therefore, based on the given label information, it would appear that there is no known evidence supporting a definite relationship between nisoldipine and acute liver injury. However, it is important to consider that adverse reactions can be underreported or identified post-approval, and ongoing monitoring and further clinical research could potentially reveal new information on this subject. Health professionals are typically encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions related to drug therapy to enhance the understanding of the safety profile of medications.",NA
acute liver injury,nitisinone,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction in the provided drug label sections for nitisinone (NITYR). Instead, adverse reactions that were reported in more than 1% of patients in clinical trials included elevated tyrosine levels, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and various ocular symptoms, among others. Serious and clinically significant adverse reactions described elsewhere in the labeling include ocular symptoms, developmental delay, and hyperkeratotic plaques due to elevated plasma tyrosine levels, as well as leukopenia and severe thrombocytopenia.

Complications related to the liver as a result of using nitisinone, according to the clinical trial data provided, were liver transplantation (reported in 13% of the patients), liver failure (7%), malignant hepatic neoplasms (5%), benign hepatic neoplasms (3%), and porphyria (1%). These findings suggest that hepatic effects can be associated with nitisinone treatment, although they are more indicative of complications of Hereditary Tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) itself rather than direct adverse reactions to the drug.

In this context, it is important to differentiate between direct drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and the progression of underlying liver disease due to HT-1, which nitisinone is used to treat. DILI typically refers to liver damage caused by a medication, whereas progression of underlying liver disease might occur irrespective of drug treatment but could also be influenced by the treatment.

The absence of mentioning acute liver injury specifically as an adverse reaction in the provided labels suggests that either this particular adverse effect was not observed or reported in the studied population or that it was not common or significant enough to be included within this section of the labeling. It is essential to review full product labeling, clinical study reports, post-marketing surveillance data, and published case reports to determine if there have been any clinically significant associations of acute liver injury with nitisinone use that might have emerged after the period covered by these label sections.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections do not offer evidence to support a direct relationship between acute liver injury and nitisinone (NITYR), although there were related hepatic complications disclosed which could be indicative of the disease’s progression rather than a specific adverse reaction to the medication. Further review of comprehensive sources might be necessary to ascertain if any evidence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to nitisinone exists beyond this provided labeling information.",NA
acute liver injury,nitrofurantoin,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and nitrofurantoin exposure is drawn from various sources including clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance as indicated in the provided drug label sections.

From the provided drug label sections, hepatic adverse reactions associated with the use of nitrofurantoin appear rare but have been documented. Specific liver-related issues include:

- Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)
- Cholestatic jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes due to bile flow obstruction)
- Chronic active hepatitis (ongoing inflammation of the liver)
- Hepatic necrosis (death of liver cells)

These hepatic events are listed under adverse reactions in the product label and are highlighted with a warning that suggests clinical monitoring and potential discontinuation of the drug should symptoms arise.

The categorization of these hepatic reactions as rare suggests that they were not commonly observed in clinical trials, where the frequency of events and relationship to the drug would be more systematically evaluated. Given the context of labeling, these reactions are likely derived from post-marketing surveillance where healthcare providers and patients submit reports of adverse reactions suspected to be associated with the drug after it has been released to the market. These spontaneous reports are voluntarily submitted, and while they can indicate potential drug-related problems, they do not establish causality. Further investigation is usually required to confirm that these adverse reactions are related to the drug.

It is important to note that while these hepatic adverse reactions are listed in the drug label, in the absence of detailed clinical trials data or case study evidence provided in the label sections, the quality, and strength of evidence cannot be comprehensively evaluated.

Additionally, the labeling information indicates that other risk factors such as debilitation and concurrent medical conditions may increase the risk for the development of certain adverse effects, although it does not specify this for liver injury.

In conclusion, the drug label for nitrofurantoin suggests a potential risk for acute liver injury based on its inclusion in the warnings and documented adverse reactions. However, given the rarity of these events and the lack of detailed evidence provided, it is difficult to precisely evaluate the strength of the relationship without access to more detailed clinical data or peer-reviewed studies. It is recommended that practitioners monitor hepatic functions and consider the overall risk-benefit of nitrofurantoin use in patients, especially those with preexisting liver conditions or concurrent medication use that may increase the risk for liver injury.","NA

The provided drug label section indicates that hepatic reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely with the use of nitrofurantoin. This statement confirms the presence of a relationship between nitrofurantoin and acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, although such events are rare. Therefore, evidence refuting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of nitrofurantoin is not present."
acute liver injury,nizatidine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the association between nizatidine exposure and acute liver injury.

In the adverse reactions section, the drug label mentions that hepatocellular injury, evidenced by elevated liver enzyme tests (such as SGOT [AST], SGPT [ALT], or alkaline phosphatase), occurred in some patients and was possibly or probably related to nizatidine. Furthermore, there were cases with marked elevation of SGOT and SGPT enzymes, with one instance of SGPT greater than 2,000 IU/L. Despite these occurrences, the overall rate of liver enzyme abnormalities did not differ significantly from that in the placebo-treated patients. Importantly, all abnormalities were reversible after discontinuation of the drug.

Additionally, since the market release of nizatidine, there have been post-marketing reports of hepatitis and jaundice, including rare cases of cholestatic or mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic injury with jaundice, which also resolved after discontinuing the medication.

The evidence from controlled clinical trials demonstrates that nizatidine can cause liver enzyme elevations, which are a known indicator of liver injury. Moreover, the post-marketing surveillance data, which include reports of hepatitis and jaundice, support the relationship between nizatidine exposure and acute liver injury. Although these liver-related adverse events appear to be rare, the reversibility of liver abnormalities after stopping nizatidine further supports the drug's potential to cause acute liver injury.

However, it is important to note that the incidence of elevated liver enzymes was not significantly different between nizatidine and placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. This might suggest that while there is a potential for liver injury, it may not be common or it could be influenced by various factors including pre-existing conditions, concomitant medications, or idiosyncratic reactions. Clinicians should consider these findings when prescribing nizatidine and monitor patients accordingly for signs of liver dysfunction.",NA
acute liver injury,nortriptyline,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nortriptyline, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a known adverse reaction within the sections for Adverse Reactions, Warnings, or Box Warnings. However, the label does mention ""jaundice (simulating obstructive),"" and ""altered liver function"" under the 'Other' subsection of Adverse Reactions, which suggests that liver-related effects have been observed. Jaundice is typically a sign of underlying liver issues and may imply that liver injury could occur, albeit the label does not specifically detail ""acute liver injury.""

Although the explicit term ""acute liver injury"" is not used, the symptoms described (jaundice and altered liver function) can be indicative of liver injury. The information provided does not quantify the frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship between nortriptyline and liver injury, as these can be complex and multifactorial.

There is no further information provided regarding evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specific to acute liver injury associated with nortriptyline in the content given. However, it is important to note that post-marketing surveillance is a phase where healthcare professionals or patients report adverse reactions to the drug manufacturers or directly to regulatory agencies such as the FDA. These reports can be voluntary and may not always provide a clear or comprehensive indication of the incidence rate or a direct causal relationship, as there is often no control group for comparison.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not directly listed as an adverse reaction to nortriptyline within the provided drug label sections, there is mention of jaundice and altered liver function, which may suggest potential liver-related effects. To establish a more concrete relationship between nortriptyline and acute liver injury, one would need to review additional data sources including but not limited to clinical trial data, case studies, and more comprehensive post-marketing surveillance reports that are not included in the provided information. If such a relationship is suspected, healthcare providers typically report these cases to pharmacovigilance systems for further investigation and potential inclusion in future label updates.",NA
acute liver injury,obeticholic acid,,"The relationship between acute liver injury and obeticholic acid (OCALIVA) exposure is supported by evidence derived from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. 

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the adverse reactions section of the drug label, hepatic adverse reactions including ascites and hepatic encephalopathy are reported in patients treated with OCALIVA in the context of the trial, specifically Trial 1. These adverse reactions suggest a potential risk for liver-related adverse effects. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was observed for hepatic adverse reactions with dosages of OCALIVA up to 50 mg once daily (which is up to 5-times the highest recommended dosage) as early as one month after starting treatment. Furthermore, exposure-adjusted incidence rates for all serious and clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions and isolated elevations in liver biochemical tests per 100 patient exposure years were higher for OCALIVA-treated groups compared to placebo.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
There have been reports of liver failure, new onset cirrhosis, increased direct and total bilirubin levels, and new or worsening jaundice reported in patients taking OCALIVA, which were identified during post-approval use of the drug. It is important to note that these reports mentioned that the median time to hepatic decompensation was 4 months for patients with compensated cirrhosis and 2.5 months for those with decompensated cirrhosis.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label includes a boxed warning, indicating that hepatic decompensation and failure, sometimes fatal or leading to liver transplant, have been reported with OCALIVA treatment in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients with cirrhosis (both compensated and decompensated). It also mentions that hepatotoxicity was observed in clinical trials. The label advises routine monitoring for progression of PBC, including hepatic adverse reactions, and to discontinue OCALIVA in cases of hepatic decompensation, development of portal hypertension, or experience of clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions.

Summary:
Overall, the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as noted in the adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections of the drug label for OCALIVA, indicates that there is an association between obeticholic acid exposure and the risk of acute liver injury, including decompensation and failure, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. The evidence suggests that such adverse liver reactions can be serious and potentially fatal and that monitoring liver function is essential when administering obeticholic acid to mitigate risks.",NA
acute liver injury,obinutuzumab,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction associated with obinutuzumab (GAZYVA) in the provided label sections. However, liver enzyme elevations are noted to have occurred in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who received GAZYVA and had normal baseline hepatic enzyme levels. These events most frequently occurred within 24–48 hours of the first infusion, often concurrently with infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or tumor lysis syndrome. Management recommendations include monitoring liver function tests during treatment, especially during the first cycle. Consideration for treatment interruption or discontinuation is given for hepatotoxicity [see ""Liver Enzyme Elevations"" under Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The evidence for obinutuzumab-related hepatotoxicity primarily comes from clinical trial observations, such as the CLL11 study. The label does not explicitly link obinutuzumab to acute liver injury, but the noted elevations in liver enzyme levels suggest that liver injury could be an indirect effect or a complication arising in the context of other adverse events.

Additionally, hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is highlighted as a serious risk with GAZYVA, and measures are warranted including HBV screening before initiating treatment, monitoring HBV-positive patients during and after GAZYVA therapy, and immediate discontinuation of GAZYVA in the case of HBV reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Boxed Warning].

No specific data from post-marketing surveillance regarding acute liver injury is provided in the label sections cited. Therefore, while there is evidence of liver enzyme elevations, acute liver injury as a discrete clinical entity is not documented here as a recognized adverse reaction specifically associated with obinutuzumab treatment. It is also important to note that medications used to prevent IRRs, such as acetaminophen, may contribute to liver enzyme elevations [see ""Liver Enzyme Elevations"" under Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In conclusion, the provided drug label identifies liver enzyme elevations and HBV reactivation as potential liver-related concerns with obinutuzumab but does not present acute liver injury as a recognized adverse reaction in the context of obinutuzumab exposure. The evidence comes from clinical trial observations with management strategies included in the label.",NA
acute liver injury,obinutuzumab,,"Summary of Evidence:
Obinutuzumab (GAZYVA) is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody indicated for various types of blood cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). The prescribing information for obinutuzumab includes a detailed account of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, postmarketing experience, and specific warnings related to hepatotoxicity, but there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse effect.

The detailed safety data provided in the prescribing information primarily lists infusion-related reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and infections as the most significant and common adverse reactions. It also includes warnings and precautions for serious conditions such as hepatitis B virus reactivation and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Liver Enzyme Elevations:
The prescribing information for obinutuzumab does note that hepatic enzyme elevations have occurred in patients receiving the drug during clinical trials and typically presented within 24–48 hours of the first infusion. These elevations were often concurrent with infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or tumor lysis syndrome. However, these are distinct from acute liver injury, which involves a more severe and direct impairment of liver function.

Hepatotoxicity Warnings:
In section 5 of the prescribing information, there is a warning about Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation that can occur in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies like obinutuzumab, potentially leading to severe hepatitis, liver failure, and even death. This is more of a reactivation of an existing virus than an adverse drug-induced liver injury. Nonetheless, it is an important hepatic consideration, and patients are to be screened for HBV before initiating treatment. Furthermore, the document advises monitoring liver function tests during treatment, especially during the first cycle, but it does not specify acute liver injury as a recognized adverse reaction.

Postmarketing Experience:
According to the document, the postmarketing experience doesn't clearly list acute liver injury as a known adverse event from obinutuzumab exposure.

Conclusion:
While the prescribing information for obinutuzumab does detail several adverse reactions and significant hepatotoxicity warnings related to HBV reactivation and liver enzyme elevations, it does not explicitly report acute liver injury as a common or recognized adverse reaction to the drug. The bulk of liver-related concerns are tied to pre-existing conditions (such as HBV) that can be exacerbated by the treatment. This distinction is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient management. Therefore, although hepatotoxicity has been observed in a more general sense, there is no specific or direct evidence within the provided sections of the prescribing information that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction to obinutuzumab based on clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data.",NA
acute liver injury,odevixibat,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, odevixibat (BYLVAY) has been associated with liver test abnormalities, which could potentially indicate acute liver injury. The evidence comes from clinical trials conducted in patients with Progressive Familial Intraheptic Cholestasis (PFIC) and Alagille Syndrome (ALGS). Here is a structured summary of the key findings:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**

1. **PFIC Clinical Studies:**
    - **Trial 1** was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating two dose levels of odevixibat (40 mcg/kg and 120 mcg/kg daily). Significant adverse reactions included diarrhea, liver test abnormalities (elevations in alanine aspartate transaminase [ALT], an indicator of liver injury, and total and direct bilirubin), vomiting, abdominal pain, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.
    - **Trial 2** was a 72-week, open-label, single-arm trial. The most common reason for odevixibat treatment interruption was liver test abnormalities such as increases in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin. Two patients had to undergo surgical interventions secondary to complications (pruritus unresponsive to odevixibat treatment), but these are not directly indicative of acute liver injury.

2. **ALGS Clinical Studies:**
    - **Trial 3** was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a single dose level of odevixibat (120 mcg/kg daily). Again, increased incidence of adverse reactions was observed, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Elevation in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) was also noted.
    - **Trial 4** was a 72-week open-label extension study. Gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea and abdominal pain, were cited as common reasons for odevixibat treatment interruption.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

- **Liver Test Abnormalities (5.1):** Both PFIC and ALGS patients exhibited baseline liver test abnormalities. During trials, treatment-emergent elevations or worsening of liver tests were observed, including increased AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels. Dose adjustments or interruptions were sometimes necessary, and persistent or recurrent abnormalities may warrant discontinuation of the treatment. 

**Post-marketing Surveillance:**

- There is no specific post-marketing surveillance data provided in the label sections shared here. Typically, such data, if available, might further elucidate the relationship between drug exposure and adverse reactions, including acute liver injury, after a drug is commercially available and used in a broader patient population.

In conclusion, there is clear evidence from clinical trials indicating that odevixibat can lead to abnormalities in liver tests, suggesting a potential for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. However, there are no explicit cases of acute liver injury directly reported within the presented data. It should be noted that those experiencing an adverse reaction related to liver function were managed by dose adjustments or treatment interruptions. Monitoring liver tests before and during treatment with odevixibat is recommended to manage this risk.","NA

The provided label information indicates that liver test abnormalities are  a known adverse reaction to odevixibat (BYLVAY), particularly elevations in ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and direct and total bilirubin levels. There is no specific mention or evidence provided in the label to refute the relationship between acute liver injury and odevixibat exposure."
acute liver injury,olanzapine,,"The drug label for olanzapine does not explicitly list acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. Acute liver injury is often identified by elevated liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). According to the label:

- In clinical trials, some patients experienced elevation of liver enzymes; specifically, increases in ALT were considered drug-related and led to discontinuation in 2% of olanzapine-treated patients versus 0% for placebo in schizophrenia trials.

- The section on laboratory changes mentions that olanzapine treatment was associated with asymptomatic increases in ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in the premarketing experience. However, no symptomatic liver injury or jaundice was reported, and most changes were transient and resolved while treatment continued.

- Clinically significant increases in ALT (change from <3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline to ≥3 times ULN) were observed in 5% of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1% of patients exposed to placebo in the clinical trials. ALT elevations ≥5 times ULN were observed in 2% of olanzapine-treated patients vs. 0.3% of placebo-treated patients.

- The label advises caution for patients with signs of hepatic impairment, pre-existing conditions affecting liver reserve, or those on potentially hepatotoxic drugs.

Postmarketing experience has identified liver-related adverse reactions such as cholestatic or mixed liver injury, hepatitis, and jaundice, which have been temporally (but not necessarily causally) associated with olanzapine treatment.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not listed among the most common adverse reactions (>5%) for olanzapine, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that olanzapine can cause elevations in liver enzymes, which may indicate hepatic injury. These events appear to be infrequent and are typically asymptomatic and transient. Nevertheless, caution is recommended for patients who might be at increased risk for liver injury. Clinical monitoring is recommended, especially in patients with potential risk factors for liver disease or those concurrently using other medications with hepatotoxic potential.",NA
acute liver injury,olsalazine,,"The provided drug label information for olsalazine describes various adverse reactions, but does not directly list acute liver injury among the most commonly reported reactions. However, under the Hepatobiliary Disorders section in the postmarketing data, it does mention ""reports of hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver function tests (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, cirrhosis, and possible hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure.""

These findings suggest a potential link between olsalazine use and liver injury, which could manifest as acute liver injury in patients. Since these are postmarketing reports, it's important to note that such data are often less rigorous than controlled clinical trials and may not establish causation, but they do raise potential signals of a link between drug exposure and adverse outcomes. The reported hepatotoxicity cases vary in severity, including some instances that were severe and even fatal.

The mention of a patient who developed ""mild cholestatic hepatitis"" during treatment with sulfasalazine and experienced the same symptoms after switching to olsalazine hints at a potential class effect, as olsalazine and sulfasalazine both belong to the same drug class (5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives).

Furthermore, rare cases of ""granulomatous hepatitis and nonspecific, reactive hepatitis"" are also noted in patients receiving olsalazine, providing additional, albeit rare, case-level evidence of liver injury associated with the drug. It is also indicated that the withdrawal of olsalazine led to recovery in these cases, supporting a possible causal relationship.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not among the most common adverse reactions to olsalazine, the postmarketing evidence includes reports of various forms of hepatotoxicity potentially associated with the drug. These drawn from spontaneous reporting systems lack the rigor of controlled clinical trials but suggest that liver injury, which could include acute liver events, is a potential risk of olsalazine. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor liver function tests in patients taking olsalazine and for patients to be aware of signs and symptoms that could suggest liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,olutasidenib,,"Evidence gathered from clinical trials indicates that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction associated with olutasidenib, which is commercially known as REZLIDHIA. The drug is generally used in the management of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH1 mutation, as noted in the clinical studies provided.

Within the safety assessment of a clinical trial involving 153 adults with relapsed or refractory AML with an IDH1 mutation, hepatotoxicity—which can manifest as acute liver injury—was reported. The trial data revealed that 23% of patients experienced some degree of hepatotoxicity. Among these individuals, 13% encountered severe hepatotoxicity, recognized as grade 3 or 4, referring to events that are severe or life-threatening.

Furthermore, the document cites that hepatotoxic adverse reactions to olutasidenib included increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, and elevated bilirubin levels. The trial reported one patient death due to complications of drug-induced liver injury when olutasidenib was used with azacitidine, a combination outside the indicated use for olutasidenib.

The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity was 1.2 months (ranging from 1 day to 17.5 months) after starting treatment with olutasidenib, while the median time to resolution was reported as 12 days (range: 1 day to 17 months).

Regarding post-marketing surveillance, no specific data is provided in the summary. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions is encouraged, which implies ongoing monitoring of the drug's safety profile after it has been released onto the market.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials demonstrates that there is a relationship between olutasidenib and the potential for acute liver injury, presenting mainly as increased liver enzyme levels and bilirubin. Close monitoring of liver function tests during treatment with olutasidenib is recommended to manage and potentially mitigate this risk.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for olutasidenib (REZLIDHIA), hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver function tests such as increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, is listed as a potential adverse effect of the drug. There is no evidence presented here that refutes the relationship between olutasidenib and acute liver injury; in fact, the provided information confirms hepatotoxicity as an observed adverse reaction. Therefore, it is not appropriate to summarize evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and olutasidenib exposure as the relationship is acknowledged in the drug labeling."
acute liver injury,omaveloxolone,,"The available evidence for the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to omaveloxolone (marketed as SKYCLARYS) primarily comes from clinical trial data described in the drug's labeling. There are no box warnings regarding liver injury on the drug label, but there is a specific warning concerning elevation of aminotransferases:

1. Clinical Trial Evidence:
The main support for the relationship between omaveloxolone and potential acute liver injury stems from clinical trials, particularly Study 1, which evaluated the safety of SKYCLARYS at a dosage of 150 mg daily in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. 

- The incidence of elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) was notably higher in patients treated with SKYCLARYS compared to the placebo group (37% vs. 2% for AST/ALT elevation, respectively). 

- Study 1 reported that 16% of patients treated with SKYCLARYS had elevations of ALT above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and 31% had elevations of AST above 3 times the ULN. 

- Although there were no concomitant increases in transaminases and total bilirubin observed in the study, which would indicate severe liver injury such as drug-induced hepatotoxicity, the elevated transaminases could signify a potential risk for liver injury.

2. Recommendations and Precautions:
The label also provides specific directions regarding monitoring the liver enzymes ALT, AST, and total bilirubin prior to starting treatment, monthly for the first 3 months, and periodically thereafter. In cases where transaminase levels are notably elevated, the recommendation is to discontinue SKYCLARYS and assess liver function.

It is important to note that patients with clinically significant liver disease were excluded from the study, so the data may not fully capture the potential for liver injury in this patient population.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
No information from post-marketing surveillance is provided in the drug label.

In conclusion, clinical trial data associated with omaveloxolone's safety profile suggest a potentially increased risk of elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate acute liver injury. It is recommended to closely monitor liver function in patients on omaveloxolone to mitigate this risk, and further surveillance may be necessary to understand the long-term implications. If additional post-marketing surveillance data or case studies are available, they are not included in the provided drug label excerpts and would need to be reviewed to provide a complete assessment of the potential relationship between omaveloxolone and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,omeprazole,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (including liver disease, hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular disease, cholestatic disease, mixed hepatitis, jaundice, and elevations of liver function tests) as an adverse reaction to omeprazole is derived from post-marketing experience, as detailed in section 6.3 of the drug label.

While clinical trials are essential in identifying common adverse reactions, some rare or long-term side effects may not become apparent until after a drug has been approved and used in the broader population. In the case of omeprazole, the occurrence of liver-related adverse reactions was identified during post-approval use. This evidence comes from voluntary reports of adverse reactions from a population of uncertain size, making it challenging to reliably estimate the actual frequency or establish a definite causal relationship to drug exposure.

Specifically, the drug label mentions that the following hepatic adverse reactions have been reported:
- Hepatic failure (some fatal)
- Liver necrosis (some fatal)
- Hepatic encephalopathy
- Hepatocellular disease
- Cholestatic disease
- Mixed hepatitis
- Jaundice
- Elevations of liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin)

Due to the nature of post-marketing surveillance, which relies on self-reporting by healthcare providers and patients, the available evidence does not allow for precise quantification of risk or a clear understanding of the mechanism by which omeprazole may cause these liver-related adverse reactions. However, the listing of these reactions in the drug’s labeling is an indication that there have been sufficient reports to warrant caution and further investigation into these potential adverse reactions.

It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of these potential risks and to monitor liver function in patients who are using oremprazole, especially if they present with symptoms suggesting liver injury or if they are using omeprazole for extended periods.

Sources:
- The provided sections (6.3 Postmarketing Experience, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) of the omeprazole drug label.",NA
acute liver injury,ondansetron,,"The available evidence for the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to ondansetron, based on the provided drug label sections, can be summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- Hepatic transaminase elevations: In clinical trials involving patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy with normal baseline AST and ALT levels, approximately 5% of the patients experienced transaminase levels exceeding twice the upper limit of normal upon exposure to ondansetron. However, these increases were transient and did not appear to be related to the dose or duration of therapy with ondansetron. There were no reports of symptomatic hepatic disease associated with these enzyme elevations during the trials.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- Liver enzyme abnormalities: Abnormalities in liver enzymes have been reported based on voluntary postmarketing reporting from users of ondansetron. Because these postmarketing reports come from an uncertain population size and are not reported in a standardized manner, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency or conclusively determine a causal link to the drug.
- Liver failure and death: There have been reported instances of liver failure and death in cancer patients who were receiving ondansetron along with other medications, including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The reports do not offer a definitive conclusion about the causality of ondansetron in these cases.

From the information provided in the drug label, while there have been occurrences of elevated hepatic enzymes and reports of liver abnormalities postmarketing, the evidence does not conclusively establish acute liver injury as a direct and consistent adverse effect of ondansetron. The reported liver enzyme abnormalities seem to be transient and are not clearly linked to direct hepatotoxicity of the drug. Furthermore, the cases of liver failure and death were reported in a complex clinical context with concurrent administration of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, making it difficult to attribute the adverse outcomes to ondansetron alone.

In conclusion, while there is evidence of hepatic enzyme elevations in some patients treated with ondansetron, there is insufficient evidence in the drug label provided to establish a definitive causative relationship between ondansetron exposure and acute liver injury. Additional clinical research, controlled studies, and continued postmarketing surveillance may be necessary to better elucidate this potential adverse reaction.","NA

Based on the provided sections from the drug label for ondansetron, there is no specific evidence that refutes the occurrence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction related to ondansetron. It is mentioned that liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported but there is no clear refutation of acute liver injury being caused by the drug available in the provided text.

However, it is important to consider that the absence of refuting evidence in the drug label does not confirm that acute liver injury cannot occur. It implies that either it has not been reported sufficiently in the literature or observed in clinical practice to warrant a specific refutation on the label. Adverse reactions are assessed based on their frequency and causality, and this information continues to evolve as more data become available from post-marketing surveillance."
acute liver injury,orlistat,1.0,"Clinical Trials Evidence:
The clinical trials of orlistat, marketed as Xenical, primarily documented gastrointestinal side effects, as highlighted in section 6.1 of the drug label. In these trials, adverse events like oily spotting, flatus with discharge, fecal urgency, fatty/oily stool, and fecal incontinence were the most commonly observed reactions. These events, which can be considered a direct effect of orlistat's mechanism of action (inhibiting the absorption of fats), occurred in a significant percentage of patients compared to the placebo group.

Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence:
More severe adverse events, including acute liver injury, have been reported in the postmarketing experience, as mentioned in section 6.2 of the drug label. Although these liver-related adverse reactions are considered rare, they include cases of increased transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serious hepatitis, and in some very severe cases, hepatic failure leading to liver transplant or death. It is important to note that because these reports are based on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, establishing a reliable frequency or a definitive causal relationship to orlistat exposure is challenging.

Warnings:
The warnings section 5.2 reflects these concerns by noting that rare postmarketing reports of severe liver injury have been reported. Patients are advised to watch for symptoms of liver dysfunction such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, and upper right abdominal pain. If such symptoms occur, the use of orlistat should be discontinued, and liver function tests should be performed.

Evidence Evaluation:
The evidence from clinical trials does not commonly report severe liver injury as an adverse reaction to orlistat. However, postmarketing surveillance, which can sometimes reveal rarer adverse events not seen in clinical trials due to their larger and less controlled nature, has indeed reported such instances. Despite the low frequency of liver injury reports, the potential for serious outcomes has led to the inclusion of these risks in the drug label's warning section.

In scenarios like this, where clinical trials may not have captured a potential adverse reaction due to rarity, postmarketing surveillance plays a crucial role in continuing to evaluate the safety profile of a drug like orlistat. Prescribers and patients should be aware of the potential for serious liver injury, although such reactions are considered rare. The exact mechanism by which orlistat could lead to liver injury is not fully understood and may warrant further research to establish a more clear-cut causal link.",NA
acute liver injury,oseltamivir,,"The provided drug label sections for oseltamivir do not include acute liver injury as a commonly reported adverse reaction. The listed adverse reactions from clinical trials primarily focus on gastrointestinal disorders, including nausea and vomiting, and other reactions such as headache and pain. Importantly, the section on post-marketing experience also does not specifically mention acute liver injury but does report hepatitis and abnormal liver function tests, which could suggest possible liver-related issues.

To summarize, while the clinical trial data from the label does not explicitly state acute liver shrinkage as a side effect, post-marketing surveillance data indicates the possibility of hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatitis and abnormal liver function tests following oseltamivir use. However, given the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports and the lack of explicit mention of acute liver injury, establishing a direct causal relationship between oseltamivir exposure and acute liver injury is not possible based solely on this information.

Evidence could potentially be strengthened by epidemiological studies, case reports, and further examination of post-marketing surveillance data, but these sources are not included in the drug label information provided. For a definitive summary of the relationship between acute liver injury and oseltamivir, additional research and data sources would need to be reviewed.","Based on the provided drug label sections for oseltamivir, there is no mention of acute liver injury as a common or serious adverse reaction in either the clinical trials or the post-marketing experience sections. In the sections describing adverse reactions (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS), hepatobiliary disorders are only briefly mentioned in the post-marketing experience (6.2 Post-marketing Experience) where hepatitis and abnormal liver function tests have been identified. However, there is an important distinction between hepatitis and acute liver injury; hepatitis can be a result of various etiologies and does not necessarily equate to drug-induced acute liver injury.

The sections provided do not list acute liver injury as a documented adverse reaction through clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance. This absence suggests that if acute liver injury is related to oseltamivir use, it is not common enough to have been identified as a significant adverse reaction in the studied populations. However, without specific studies or case reports focusing on oseltamivir and acute liver injury, one cannot definitively refute the relationship.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections do not provide evidence to support acute liver injury as a recognized adverse reaction to oseltamivir. Nonetheless, this absence of evidence is not in itself evidence of absence, and healthcare professionals should monitor patients for adverse reactions as part of good clinical practice."
acute liver injury,oxacillin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, oxacillin may be associated with various adverse reactions affecting different systems of the body. Specifically, for acute liver injury, the label mentions hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction. Hepatotoxicity is characterized by symptoms such as fever, nausea, and vomiting, and is associated with abnormal liver function tests, mainly elevated SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, an enzyme that is typically increased in the blood when the liver or heart are damaged) levels.

While the label clearly states this adverse reaction, it does not provide detailed information on the frequency of occurrence or the clinical context (e.g. dosages involved or duration of treatment related to the adverse reaction). It is important to note that this type of information is often derived from broader sources including:

1. Clinical Trials: These are systematic studies on human subjects designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, providing information about side effects and adverse reactions.

2. Case Studies: These are detailed reports of the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of an individual patient concerning a particular adverse event. Case studies provide insight into the clinical presentation and management of rare adverse reactions.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance: After a drug is approved and marketed, ongoing monitoring of drug safety (pharmacovigilance) can detect adverse reactions that were not apparent during the clinical trials. This includes voluntary reporting systems like the FDA's MedWatch.

Although the provided section does not cite specific studies, the mention of hepatotoxicity in the label indicates that there has likely been evidence from pre-approval clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that supports a relationship between oxacillin exposure and acute liver injury.

Healthcare providers reporting adverse reactions such as acute liver injury following oxacillin use is part of the surveillance that contributes to the understanding of the drug's safety profile. The directive to report suspected adverse reactions to the FDA is part of the mechanism that enables further collection and analysis of data on reported hepatotoxic incidents associated with oxacillin.

In summary, the adverse reactions section of the oxacillin drug label includes hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse effect, characterized by fever, nausea, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. Specific incidents and prevalence are not detailed in the label, but this information could potentially be sourced from clinical trials, case studies, and ongoing post-marketing surveillance, which are standard regulatory practices to assure drug safety.",NA
acute liver injury,oxaliplatin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and oxaliplatin comes from the drug label sections provided. Acute liver injury can be classified under the broader category of hepatotoxicity, which is mentioned in the drug label as follows:

1. Under the section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, hepatotoxicity is specifically listed in the warnings and precautions to monitor.
2. In the CLINICAL TRIALS EXPERIENCE section (6.1), increased transaminases and alkaline phosphatase are reported as some of the most common adverse reactions in more than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin. These findings are indicators of liver injury.
3. The drug label notes the observation of hepatotoxicity in clinical trials, mentioning increased transaminases (57% vs 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs 20%) more commonly in the oxaliplatin arm than in the fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the adjuvant treatment trial.
4. Hepatotoxicity section 5.6 also describes changes noted on liver biopsies, including peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. While these do not specifically mention acute liver injury, they are related to liver damage which could potentially manifest as such.

While acute liver injury is not explicitly listed, the evidence points to manifestations of liver toxicity associated with oxaliplatinum use, which include increases in liver enzymes and other histological changes indicative of liver damage. The evidence is derived from clinical trials and encompasses observations from a large pool of patients receiving oxaliplatin. No specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data were provided to support the relationship between acute liver injury and oxaliplatin, but the clinical trial data is substantial. 

It is important to note that abnormal liver tests and hepatotoxicity should be vigilantly monitored as indicated in the drug label, emphasizing the potential for adverse liver-related reactions with the use of oxaliplatin.

Based on the available information, clinicians should be aware of the hepatotoxic potential of oxaliplatin and manage patients accordingly, which may include routine monitoring of liver function tests and appropriate intervention should signs of liver injury emerge.",NA
acute liver injury,oxandrolone,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for oxandrolone, an anabolic steroid, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between the drug and the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury. The label explicitly mentions hepatic adverse reactions associated with the use of anabolic steroids, including:

1. Cholestatic jaundice: This condition, which involves bile buildup due to obstruction of bile flow, can sometimes advance to hepatic necrosis (liver cell death) and potentially result in death.
2. Hepatocellular neoplasms and peliosis hepatis: With long-term oxandrolone therapy, there is a risk of developing liver cell tumors and peliosis hepatis, a condition characterized by blood-filled cysts in the liver. While the cysts may be associated with minimal hepatic dysfunction, they have also been linked to liver failure and life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The label indicates that withdrawal from the drug usually results in the disappearance of these lesions.
3. Reversible changes in liver function tests: The drug label remarks on alterations in liver function tests, which include an increased retention of bromsulfophthalein (BSP) and elevated levels of serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), enzymes that when elevated, are indicative of liver injury or inflammation.
4. Liver cell tumors: Benign and malignant tumors have been reported, with indications that withdrawal of the drug can result in the regression of the benign tumors.

The boxed warnings of the label underscore the significance of these hepatic adverse effects, particularly focusing on the risks of peliosis hepatis and liver cell tumors. These serious conditions are potential indicators of acute liver injury, which can range from minimal hepatic dysfunction to life-threatening liver failure and hemorrhage.

As for evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, the drug label does not provide specific references to these sources. However, the inclusion of these adverse reactions in the label suggests that the manufacturer and regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have determined that there is sufficient evidence to associate oxandrolone with a risk of acute liver injury based on clinical or post-marketing experiences.

In summary, the drug label for oxandrolone provides evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with its use, as indicated by the description of specific hepatic adverse reactions and serious risks highlighted in the boxed warnings. For more detailed evidence, one would need to consult additional sources such as published clinical trials, case reports, and databases of post-marketing surveillance.",NA
acute liver injury,oxaprozin,1.0,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to oxaprozin, an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), comes primarily from the drug's labeling, such as the one provided, which includes information from clinical trials and postmarketing experience. Oxaprozin's label includes a specific warning about hepatotoxicity in section 5.3:

**Hepatotoxicity:** The summary in this section discusses observed elevations in liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and, although rare, the serious cases of severe liver injury such as fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. It is noted that approximately 1% of patients treated with NSAIDs in clinical trials experienced ALT or AST elevations that were three or more times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Additionally, less severe elevations (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs like oxaprozin.

The warning advises that if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), oxaprozin should be discontinued immediately.

In terms of postmarketing experience (section 6.2), oxaprozin has been associated with adverse reactions involving the liver, such as hepatitis. However, the frequency or causal relationship to drug exposure is difficult to estimate because these reports are voluntary and from a population of unclear size.

It is essential to consider that postmarketing surveillance can sometimes reveal adverse effects not detected in clinical trials due to the broader and more diverse population exposed to the drug after approval. The postmarketing reports supplement the data from clinical trials, highlighting the potential risk of acute liver injury associated with oxaprozin use.

Overall, the drug's label indicates a recognized but infrequent association between oxaprozin use and acute liver injury, including severe forms like hepatitis and potentially fatal hepatic failure. Healthcare providers are advised to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity and discontinue the drug if appropriate. These details from the label represent aggregated information from controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance regarding the hepatic risks of oxaprozin.",NA
acute liver injury,oxcarbazepine,,"The evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance does not directly indicate that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction to oxcarbazepine based on the provided sections of the drug label. The sections you have provided describe a range of adverse reactions and serious side effects related to the use of oxcarbazepine; however, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned among them.

In the ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" section, abnormal liver function tests are noted as characteristic features of multi-organ hypersensitivity disorders, which have also been characterized by rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and arthralgia. This may suggest that liver issues could potentially arise as part of a broader hypersensitivity reaction to oxcarbazepine, but this is not specific to acute liver injury.

It should be noted that adverse drug reactions such as liver injury could be underreported or occur as idiosyncratic reactions in specific patients. In any case, due to the heterogeneity of patient responses to medications, healthcare professionals should monitor for any signs of liver dysfunction during treatment with oxcarbazepine.

In absence of more targeted data or explicit mentions within the sections supplied, it is essential to review additional information sources like the scientific literature or databases for specific case reports or studies that might report a direct association between oxcarbazepine and acute liver injury. If such evidence exists, it should detail the nature, frequency, and severity of liver injury events, as well as any potential risk factors or mechanisms underlying this adverse effect. 

For now, based on the provided information from the sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing surveillance, there is no clearly stated evidence to establish a direct causal relationship between acute liver injury and oxcarbazepine use. It is advised to consult the complete prescribing information and recent literature for the most current and comprehensive safety information regarding oxcarbazepine.",NA
acute liver injury,paclitaxel,,"The provided drug label sections contain extensive information about the adverse reactions and safety considerations associated with the use of Paclitaxel Protein-Bound Particles for Injectable Suspension (Albumin-Bound), which is a formulation of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel bound to albumin. Acute liver injury is typically characterized by the elevation of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and bilirubin as well as clinical symptoms related to liver dysfunction.

Reviewing the details from the drug label, although various adverse reactions are listed for protein-bound paclitaxel, acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned as a common reaction. However, there are references to hepatic adverse reactions in the Clinical Trials Experience and Postmarketing Experience sections:

1. In the Clinical Trials Experience section, elevations in hepatic enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and AST (SGOT) are mentioned multiple times as reactions occurring in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) are reported for a subset of patients, indicative of hepatic stress or injury.

2. The Postmarketing Experience section reports cases of hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death in patients treated with paclitaxel injection, which may be expected to occur with protein-bound paclitaxel as well, suggesting that severe liver injury is a potential risk, even though it might be rare.

3. The Warnings and Precautions section advises close monitoring and possible dose reduction for patients with hepatic impairment, indicating that paclitaxel can impact liver function and caution is required in patients with pre-existing liver conditions.

While the relationship between protein-bound paclitaxel and acute liver injury is suggested by the elevation of liver enzymes and other hepatic adverse events observed in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, the evidence is not conclusive for the specific characterization of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. Moreover, the severity of hepatic reactions can range widely, and the need for dose modifications in patients with hepatic impairment suggests that the liver is an organ of concern when administering this medication.

In summary, there is evidence for hepatic adverse reactions, including enzyme elevations and more severe conditions such as hepatic necrosis and encephalopathy, associated with paclitaxel (which is also the active drug in protein-bound paclitaxel), according to the Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Experience. However, the label does not specify ""acute liver injury"" as a typical adverse reaction, so while liver-related adverse effects are possible, they may not be among the most common or defining reactions to protein-bound paclitaxel. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor liver function in patients receiving this medication and manage the treatment accordingly.","Based on the information provided in the drug label sections for paclitaxel, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction associated with the drug. The sections about adverse reactions focus on other side effects such as myelosuppression, neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion site reactions. There are also mentions of elevated liver enzymes such as AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and alkaline phosphatase, both of which can indicate changes in liver function, but these do not specifically correlate with acute liver injury.

Furthermore, the hepatic section mentions that severe elevations in liver enzymes like GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) were reported, and that paclitaxel therapy is not recommended for patients with certain levels of liver impairment. It suggests monitoring patients with hepatic impairment for severe myelosuppression, but does not directly refute or confirm acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Additionally, postmarketing experience points to serious liver-related adverse reactions, including hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death when treated with paclitaxel injection.

In summary, the label does not provide direct evidence refuting acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to paclitaxel. Instead, it advises caution and monitoring for patients with pre-existing liver conditions or elevated liver enzymes, indicating awareness of potential liver-related issues. It is important to note that while explicit evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and paclitaxel is not provided, this does not necessarily establish that such an adverse effect is a common or characteristic reaction to the drug.

Should a comprehensive review of the scientific literature or clinical trial data be necessary to clarify the relationship, a dedicated and detailed literature search would be required, which goes beyond the scope of the information provided in the drug label excerpts. If no evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically refuting the link between paclitaxel and acute liver injury is available, it is accurate to state ""NA"" in this context."
acute liver injury,palonosetron,,"Based on the provided drug label information for palonosetron, there is evidence within clinical trials that suggests an association of palonosetron with liver-related adverse reactions. In studies of adults receiving chemotherapy, there are reports of ""transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin,"" with these changes occurring predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. This suggests a potential for acute liver injury; however, the reactions described are characterized as transient and asymptomatic, which may not equate to clinically significant acute liver injury.

In the Postmarketing Experience section (6.2), there are no specific mentions of acute liver injury. Adverse reactions in this section are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and include hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions, but there's no explicit mention of liver injury.

The Warnings and Precautions sections (5) and the Adverse Reactions section (6) do not contain a boxed warning, which is typically reserved for the most serious potential adverse reactions, for acute liver injury associated with palonosetron. 

To conclude, the provided information does not explicitly support a strong association between acute liver injury and palonosetron exposure. The observed liver enzyme elevations in clinical trials are noted, but these are not described as resulting in injury. Moreover, without further evidence such as detailed case studies, a firm causal relationship between palonosetron and acute liver injury cannot be established. It's important for healthcare professionals to monitor liver enzymes as part of standard clinical practice in patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy agents, including palonosetron. If severe liver injury is suspected, appropriate evaluation and management should be initiated.",NA
acute liver injury,palonosetron,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to palonosetron is not prominently highlighted in the sections pertaining to the most common adverse reactions (≥3%) nor in the box warnings. The sections provided do discuss general adverse reactions from clinical trials of AKYNZEO, which contains netupitant and palonosetron, but acute liver injury itself is not directly mentioned or emphasized as a common adverse reaction.

However, there is mention of ""concomitant elevations of transaminases greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin"" within the trials comparing AKYNZEO capsules to oral palonosetron (Table 7 of the label), with a comparable frequency between the AKYNZEO (netupitant 300 mg/palonosetron 0.5 mg) and palonosetron alone groups. The specific figures reported are:

- AST and/or ALT > 3 x ULN with Total Bilirubin > ULN: AKYNZEO group 3 (0.3%) vs. Palonosetron group 5 (0.6%)
- AST and/or ALT > 10 x ULN with Total Bilirubin > ULN: AKYNZEO group 0 vs. Palonosetron group 2 (0.2%)
- AST and/or ALT > 3 x ULN with Total Bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN: AKYNZEO group 1 (0.1%) vs. Palonosetron group 1 (0.1%)

Although these numbers indicate some incidents of liver function abnormalities, the provided data does not suggest a strong or causal relationship specifically between palonosetron and acute liver injury, given the low frequency and the presence of similar rates in the comparator group. These findings reflect observational data rather than a confirmed adverse reaction statistically attributed to the drug.

Additionally, there were no reports of significant liver injury in the other studies referenced, including in patients receiving palonosetron as part of the multi-cycle safety study (no concomitant transaminases and bilirubin elevations reported).

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label details, there is some evidence of liver function abnormalities observed in clinical trials, but the information does not establish acute liver injury as a prominent or significantly increased risk associated with palonosetron. It should be noted that information from post-marketing surveillance is not contained within the provided sections and could be necessary to fully evaluate the evidence for such an adverse reaction outside the context of clinical trials. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor liver function in patients being treated with palonosetron and to report any suspected adverse reactions to proper health authority channels for further investigation.",NA
acute liver injury,panobinostat,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to panobinostat (brand name FARYDAK) can be found within Section 5.6 of the provided drug label, titled ""Hepatotoxicity."" This section indicates a recognized risk of hepatic dysfunction primarily observed as elevations in aminotransferases (enzymes released by damaged liver cells) and total bilirubin in patients treated with panobinostat. Specifically, the label advises monitoring liver function before and regularly during treatment with panobinostat.

Section 6.1, under the subheading ""Clinical Trials Experience,"" provides a more detailed account of the safety data derived from clinical trials. It reflects the outcomes from 758 subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who received panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. While the safety data does not explicitly state the incidence of acute liver injury, it does note the general category of hepatotoxicity, which includes acute liver injury along with other potential liver-related adverse events. Additionally, there is mention of hepatitis B under infections observed in the trials.

Furthermore, in Section 5.6 of the warnings and precautions, there is specific instruction to monitor hepatic enzymes and to adjust dosage if abnormal liver function tests are observed during FARYDAK therapy. The need for dose adjustments based on liver function suggests a direct concern for potential liver damage, including acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the drug.

Therefore, the clinical trial experience outlined in the FARYDAK drug label, as well as the specific warnings about hepatotoxicity, provide evidence supporting the relationship between the potential for acute liver injury and drug exposure to panobinostat. It's important to note that this information comes directly from clinical trial data included in the drug label approved by regulatory authorities such as the FDA.

However, specific rates of acute liver injury as an isolated adverse reaction are not provided in the summary, nor are case studies or post-marketing surveillance data mentioned. For more detailed statistics and case-based evidence, one might need to look into additional sources such as published clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing studies in scientific literature databases.",NA
acute liver injury,pantoprazole,,"Based on the information provided from the adverse reaction sections of the drug label for pantoprazole, there is some evidence to suggest a relationship between pantoprazole use and liver injury. The relevant evidence is found in the postmarketing experience section, which indicates that hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure has been identified as an adverse reaction. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. However, the voluntary reporting of these reactions suggests that there is at least a potential association between acute liver injury and pantoprazole exposure.

The label's section ""Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium in clinical trials with a frequency of ≤2% are listed below by body system"" also lists hepatitis, which might suggest instances of liver injury.

While postmarketing surveillance provides a means to capture rare or long-term adverse effects not necessarily seen in clinical trials, it is important to note that this type of evidence is less controlled and subject to reporting biases compared to data gathered from randomized clinical trials.

Overall, there appears to be a signal of liver-related adverse reactions associated with pantoprazole, specifically hepatocellular damage and hepatitis, though the evidence is not as strong or well-characterized as that obtained through controlled clinical trials. Health care providers should be aware of this potential risk and monitor patients taking pantoprazole for signs of liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,paricalcitol,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and postmarketing experience, there is no direct evidence that links acute liver injury specifically as an adverse reaction to paricalcitol.

From the clinical trials experience, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitivity, nausea, and edema. There is a mention of 'Hepatic enzyme abnormal' under less common adverse reactions (<2%) in adult patients treated with paricalcitol in the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, this does not explicitly diagnose or link to acute liver injury. It is important to differentiate between mild hepatic enzyme abnormalities and acute liver injury, which is often more severe and requires a higher level of clinical care.

During the postmarketing experience, there are no mentions of acute liver injury. Adverse reactions in this category include immune system disorders such as angioedema, and elevated blood creatinine levels are reported, but again, there is no mention of acute liver injury.

The sections on warnings and precautions, including hypercalcemia and digitalis toxicity, do not mention liver injury as a potential risk.

In conclusion, while there is some indication of hepatic enzyme abnormalities in a small percentage of trial subjects taking paricalcitol, there is no clear evidence from the provided clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance data that indicates a direct link between paricalcitol and acute liver injury. If acute liver injury is suspected, it is advisable to review the patient's medical history, concomitant medications, and conduct a thorough clinical evaluation to ascertain the cause.",NA
acute liver injury,paroxetine,,"The extensive information provided from the drug label of Paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI) outlines numerous adverse reactions observed during the premarketing and post-marketing of this medication. However, within the provided sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings), there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to Paroxetine.

From the details found in the usual clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, the most commonly reported adverse reactions include headache, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, with other effects such as asthenia, sweating, decreased appetite, and tremors also frequently observed. Regarding liver function, the label indicates that patients treated with Paroxetine exhibited abnormal values on liver function tests at no greater rate than those seen in placebo-treated patients. This implies that, based on the information in this drug label, there is no significant evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance to establish a causal link between Paroxetine and acute liver injury.

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that adverse reactions, such as liver injury, could occur sporadically or be underreported, and therefore might not be fully captured in clinical trials or post-marketing data. For a conclusive understanding of the relationship between Paroxetine and potential acute liver injury, a detailed review of the literature, case studies, and reports to pharmacovigilance programs would be necessary. Since this specific evidence is not provided in the drug label sections submitted, it can only be concluded that, according to the given label information, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between Paroxetine and acute liver injury.

Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any observed adverse events to the appropriate pharmacovigilance systems to help in the continuous monitoring of the safety profile of medications, including potential hepatotoxic effects.","NA

The provided drug label information does not list acute liver injury as a reported adverse event or reaction associated with the use of paroxetine. Therefore, specific evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and paroxetine exposure from the provided label is not available. However, the label does mention that in placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients treated with paroxetine exhibited abnormal values on liver function tests at no greater rate than that seen in placebo-treated patients."
acute liver injury,peginterferon alfa-2a,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS) exposure is found in the available clinical trials data, adverse reactions reported during the trials, as well as in the post-marketing experience.

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
In clinical trials assessing PEGASYS, hepatic decompensation occurred in 2% of subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) coinfected with HIV, which could suggest a potential for severe liver injury in this patient population. Serious adverse events reported in CHC patients included hepatic dysfunction, fatty liver, and cholangitis, which occurred at a frequency of less than 1%. These findings indicate that liver-related adverse effects, possibly including acute liver injury, can occur albeit infrequently.

2. Adverse Reactions:
Hepatic dysfunction is documented in the adverse reactions section with serious adverse events occurring in CHC monoinfected and CHC/HIV coinfected subjects. The explicit mentioning of hepatic dysfunction as a serious adverse event indicates a recognized potential for liver-related adverse outcomes. Furthermore, marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were observed during the treatment and follow-up periods. These transient increases can indicate liver injury or exacerbation of liver disease.

3. Post-Marketing Experience:
The post-marketing experience with PEGASYS has identified acute hepatic failure and hepatitis exacerbations as adverse reactions. These reports are significant as they arise from a broader population of patients in a real-world setting, reinforcing the evidence from clinical trials.

In summary, while the rate of hepatic adverse events is not high, evidence from clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance suggests a causal relationship between peginterferon alfa-2a exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, particularly in patients with preexisting liver dysfunction or those coinfected with HIV.

It is essential to consider these risks in the context of the clinical benefits of PEGASYS, and the drug is contraindicated in patients with hepatic decompensation. Close monitoring of hepatic function is recommended for all patients receiving this treatment.

Sources:
- PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a) drug label sections: 6 Adverse Reactions, and Postmarketing Experience.
- Warnings and Precautions (5.9) section of the drug label discussing hepatic failure and exacerbation of hepatitis.
- Boxed warning and associated sections which indicate the risk of serious disorders that may occur with PEGASYS therapy, including neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infectious disorders, which collectively suggest a careful assessment of the drug's risk-benefit profile.",NA
acute liver injury,pegvisomant,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to pegvisomant, which is marketed under the name SOMAVERT, is documented in both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. 

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- In pre-approval clinical studies of SOMAVERT, there were reports of serum concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) increasing to greater than ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in two patients, equating to 0.8% of participants.
- One of these patients had a recurrence of elevated transaminase levels after being rechallenged with SOMAVERT, suggesting a probable causal association between the medication and liver enzyme elevation.
- A liver biopsy in the second patient indicated chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology, with transaminase levels normalizing after the drug was discontinued.
- The transaminase elevations appeared within 4 to 12 weeks of initiating therapy and did not correlate with dose, identifiable biochemical, phenotypic, or genetic predictors.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- Post-marketing spontaneous reports have identified episodes of elevated serum hepatic transaminases up to greater than 20 times ULN with concurrent increases in total bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN. Most cases saw improvement or resolution of liver abnormalities post-discontinuation of SOMAVERT.
- From the ACROSTUDY, an international observational registry with a mean treatment duration of 8.5 years, of the 1327 patients with normal AST and ALT at baseline, 20 (1.5%) had elevated tests >3-5 times ULN, and 22 (1.7%) had elevations >5 times ULN.

Warnings and Precautions on the Drug Label:
- The drug label advises obtaining liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating therapy with SOMAVERT and provides detailed monitoring and management protocols for patients with baseline liver test abnormalities or those who develop liver test elevations during treatment.
- Rates of adverse events should be monitored monthly for the first six months and subsequent intervals if therapy with SOMAVERT is initiated in the context of elevated baseline LFTs.

These findings from clinical trials and real-world data highlight a potential risk of acute liver injury with SOMAVERT use. The association is further substantiated by recommendations for LFT monitoring and management strategies outlined in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label. It is essential for health care providers to be vigilant about monitoring liver function in patients treated with SOMAVERT and to adjust or discontinue therapy as necessary based on individual patient response.",NA
acute liver injury,penicillamine,1.0,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections concerning adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, there is evidence that supports the relationship between penicillamine exposure and acute liver injury. Liver-related issues are specified under the ""Gastrointestinal"" adverse reactions category, where hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure, intrahepatic cholestasis, and toxic hepatitis are mentioned as observed adverse effects. The label indicates that these hepatic side effects have been reported, although their incidence is rare.

The summary of the evidence for acute liver injury due to penicillamine exposure includes the following points from the provided sections:

1. Clinical Trials Evidence: The adverse reactions section references data from 17 representative clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis patients. While specific numbers regarding the incidence of acute liver injury are not given, the documentation of hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure and toxic hepatitis, provides evidence from clinical settings that penicillamine can cause severe liver injury in some patients.

2. Case Studies and Reports: The labeling mentions isolated cases of hepatic dysfunction and rare reports of intrahepatic cholestasis and toxic hepatitis. Although specific case studies are not detailed in the provided text, the mention of these terms implies that individual occurrences have been documented and contribute to the body of evidence.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: The inclusion of hepatic side effects on the label indicates that post-marketing surveillance has also reported instances of hepatic dysfunction related to penicillamine use. The mention of rare reports further supports the idea that these adverse reactions have been observed outside of clinical trials, most likely in a broader patient population following the drug's release into the market.

It is important to interpret these findings with caution, as the incidence of such reactions is described as rare. Furthermore, the preexisting conditions of the patients, dosage, duration of therapy, and concomitant medications might also influence the risk of developing acute liver injury.

In any suspected case of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to penicillamine, it is crucial to review the patient's clinical history, laboratory findings, and rule out other potential causes of liver damage. Additionally, healthcare professionals should continuously monitor liver function in patients receiving penicillamine and be vigilant for symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, adhering to the warning of mandatory medical supervision during therapy with this drug, as outlined in the label.","NA

The provided drug label section for penicillamine indicates various potential adverse reactions associated with its use. Adverse reactions such as hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, and toxic hepatitis have been reported rarely. Moreover, isolated cases of intraheptic cholestasis have also been noted. Given these mentions, it is clear that hepatic adverse effects, including acute liver injury, are recognized as potential risks of penicillamine. Therefore, evidence refuting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to penicillamine is not available in the provided sections of the drug label."
acute liver injury,pentobarbital,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and pentobarbital exposure. Although not explicitly detailed in the information provided, liver damage is listed as one of the ""other reported reactions."" This suggests that liver damage, which can include acute liver injury, has been observed as an adverse reaction in patients. The evidence arises from adverse event surveillance of hospitalized patients who have been administered pentobarbital.

It is important to consider that the incidence of this adverse reaction is not quantified in the provided text, other than being described as an ""other reported reaction."" This category does not seem to fall under the more common or less common adverse reactions, and so its exact frequency is unclear from the information given.

No specific clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance studies are referenced in the provided text, which limits the ability to precisely detail the nature of the evidence. However, the mention of liver damage indicates some level of evidence has been collected, likely through post-marketing surveillance as thousands of hospitalized patients were monitored for adverse reactions. This may include spontaneous reports to the drug manufacturer or the FDA, as indicated by the information on how to report suspected adverse reactions.

To obtain more detailed information about the nature and strength of the evidence for acute liver injure as an adverse reaction to pentobarbital, further investigations into clinical data, published case studies, and more extensive post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary. This would help to determine the incidence rate, potential risk factors, the severity of liver injury, and any particular patterns among those affected.","Based on the provided drug label sections for pentobarbital, acute liver injury is indeed listed among the adverse reactions, though without a specific incidence rate. It falls under the category ""Other reported reactions"" and is mentioned simply as ""liver damage."" Therefore, there isn't evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to pentobarbital as provided in the drug label sections; instead, liver damage is acknowledged as a possible adverse reaction. Hence, the response to the request for evidence refuting the relationship is ""NA,"" since the drug label itself lists liver damage as an adverse reaction."
acute liver injury,pentostatin,,"Acute liver injury associated with pentostatin (marketed as NIPENT) is supported by multiple sources of evidence, primarily from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
- In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of pentostatin in patients with hairy cell leukemia, adverse events related to liver function were reported. Specifically, the table of adverse events shows that both elevated liver enzymes and liver disorders were seen in 22% of frontline patients treated with NIPENT and in 19% of interferon-refractory patients treated with NIPENT.
- Additional adverse events in the liver category (hepatic disorders/elevated liver function tests) in the SWOG 8691 study indicate potential hepatotoxicity related to the drug.

Warnings:
- The drug label warns that severe liver toxicity occurred in Phase 1 studies at higher doses than recommended. This indicates a dose-related risk for liver injury.

Post-marketing Experience:
- The drug label's section on post-marketing experience does not specifically mention acute liver injury. However, it lists adverse reactions reported during post-approval use of NIPENT, which provides a broader surveillance context of the potential hepatic adverse effects. The label does not provide specific data on the frequency or a causal relationship of liver injury to pentostatin in the post-marketing setting.

Overall, evidence from clinical trials indicates a relationship between pentostatin and adverse liver events. While acute liver injury is not explicitly detailed in the post-marketing data, the information on hepatic disorders/elevated liver function tests during the studies and liver toxicity at higher doses suggests a potential risk for acute liver injury. The drug's label and warnings corroborate these findings. Nevertheless, the absence of specific acute liver injury cases in post-marketing surveillance should be interpreted with caution due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the possibility of underreporting.","Evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and pentostatin is not present in the information provided. According to the data from clinical trials and post-marketing experience in the drug label, hepatic disorder / elevated liver function tests were reported among the various adverse events in patients treated with pentostatin. Specifically, in the adverse reactions table, 22% of frontline patients treated with NIPENT (a brand name for pentostatin) experienced hepatic disorder/elevated liver function tests.

Furthermore, under warnings, the label mentions that dose-limiting severe liver toxicity occurred in Phase 1 studies at higher doses than recommended. While the association of some adverse events such as the liver function test abnormalities may be uncertain due to potential disease-related factors, the explicit inclusion of hepatic disorder in the adverse reactions observed in trials and addressed in the warnings indicates that the relationship between pentostatin and hepatotoxic effects, including potentially acute liver injury, is acknowledged rather than refuted.

Therefore, the evidence provided suggests that acute liver injury may be a potential adverse reaction related to pentostatin rather than disproving it. NA"
acute liver injury,perindopril,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label concerning perindorpil, evidence regarding acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to perindopril includes the following:

1. Clinical Trials: Within the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse event in the clinical trials of perindopril for hypertension or stable coronary artery disease. The clinical trials experience section (6.1) identifies cough, dizziness, back pain, headache, asthenia, and hypotension as the more common adverse events, and notes elevations in liver enzymes ALT and AST, which were generally mild and transient (6.3).

2. Post-marketing Experience: The postmarketing experience section (6.2) of the drug label does list ""hepatic failure"" and ""jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic)"" as adverse events reported voluntarily and with unknown causal relationship to perindopril erbumine. Although these terms can be associated with serious liver injury, it's important to note that such data come from voluntary reports, which do not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship and often lack the detailed information found in controlled clinical trials.

3. Warnings: The drug label's section on warnings and precautions (5.8) notes that ACE inhibitors, which include perindopril, have been associated with a syndrome that could start with cholestatic jaundice and progress to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. However, it is stated that this is a rare occurrence and the mechanism is not well understood.

In summary, while there is mention of hepatic issues, such as jaundice and hepatic failure, in the warnings and post-marketing sections of the drug label, these are rare and the causal relationship to perindopril is not confirmed. There is no evidence from clinical trials that directly associates perindopril with acute liver injury. Clinical trial data does indicate mild and transient elevations in liver enzymes, which could suggest potential hepatic effects. It's crucial for health care professionals to monitor liver function in patients taking perindorpil and for patients to report any signs of liver problems to their health care providers promptly.",NA
acute liver injury,perphenazine,,"Acute liver injury is listed as a potential adverse reaction to perphenazine within the drug label sections you provided. It is described under the ""Liver damage"" subsection, which states that ""liver damage (biliary stasis) may occur,"" and ""jaundice may occur, usually between the second and fourth weeks of treatment,"" being ""regarded as a hypersensitivity reaction."" The label specifies that the incidence of this occurrence is low and that the clinical picture resembles infectious hepatitis with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice.

This evidence comes from post-marketing surveillance, as specific incidence rates or references to clinical trials are not provided. The description specifies that while the reaction is generally reversible, there have been reports of chronic jaundice. Pharmacovigilance and post-marketing surveillance are essential sources of information about rare but potentially serious adverse reactions such as liver injury because clinical trials may not be large enough or long enough to detect such rare events.

There is no explicit mention of case studies in the provided drug label section, but collectively, the individual reports that have led to this information may include case reports and clinical experience.

To summarize, acute liver injury is recognized as a potential but low-incidence adverse reaction to perphenazine based on post-marketing surveillance data, which identifies a hypersensitivity reaction characterizing liver injury or obstructive jaundice typically occurring between the second and fourth weeks of treatment. Clinical trials or case studies are not specified in the label, which suggests the evidence stems primarily from the aggregated clinical experience reported during the drug's use in the general population. It's worth noting that adverse reactions are under constant monitoring, and health care professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse events to the relevant drug safety authorities for ongoing evaluation of a drug's risk profile.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings of perphenazine, acute liver injury does appear as a potential adverse reaction (""Liver damage (biliary stasis) may occur. Jaundice may occur, usually between the second and fourth weeks of treatment...""), hence it appears to be related to perphenazine use. There are no statements within the provided information that refute the relationship between acute liver injury and perphenazine. Since evidence to the contrary is not supplied or indicated in the provided sections, no summary refuting the relationship can be given."
acute liver injury,pexidartinib,,"The clinical evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and the drug pexidartinib (TURALIO) can be summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
According to the label, the safety of pexidartinib was evaluated in the ENLIVEN clinical study. This study excluded patients with elevated liver enzymes or a history of certain liver diseases. Despite these exclusions, serious adverse liver reactions were reported, including abnormal liver tests in 3.3% of patients and hepatotoxicity in another 3.3%. Additionally, permanent discontinuation of pexidartinib due to increased ALT, AST, or hepatotoxicity occurred in 3.3% to 4.9% of patients. Dose reductions or interruptions because of liver-related adverse reactions were necessary in similarly substantial percentages.

**Laboratory Abnormalities:**
Tables 5 and 6 from the ENLIVEN trial show that TURALIO-treated patients experienced elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) compared to placebo. Increased AST and ALT were observed in a significant number of patients, with ALT increases reaching grade 3 levels in 4.9% of the treated patients. Increases in ALP and bilirubin were also noted, contributing to the evidence of potential liver injury.

**Boxed Warning and Postmarketing Experience:**
The drug's label includes a boxed warning highlighting the risk of serious and potentially fatal liver injury. The label advises health care providers to monitor liver tests before and during treatment. Moreover, the postmarketing experience section indicates that hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes, has been identified as an adverse reaction during post-approval use of the drug.

**Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):**
Due to the hepatotoxicity risk, TURALIO is only available through a REMS program, which requires liver monitoring, and it comes with recommendations to avoid prescribing the drug to patients with pre-existing liver conditions or elevated baseline liver enzymes.

In summary, data from the ENLIVEN clinical study, along with the provided adverse reaction information, the presence of a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity, and postmarketing surveillance, strongly support the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to pexidartinib. These findings underscore the importance of careful patient selection and close monitoring for liver-related adverse reactions during treatment with TURALIO.",NA
acute liver injury,phenobarbital,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and drug exposure to phenobarbital is discernible from the provided drug label sections, specifically under the category of ""Other Reported Reactions."" The label mentions ""liver damage"" as an adverse reaction which implies that there is an observed connection between phenobarbital use and hepatotoxicity, albeit the exact incidence rate in the context of acute liver injury is not specified in the given sections.

This information indicates that there have been reports of liver damage associated with the use of phenobarbital. It should be noted that ""liver damage"" can range from mild, asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations to severe liver injury, including acute liver failure.

While the exact source and context of these reports (clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, etc.) are not detailed here, the inclusion of liver damage as an adverse reaction typically arises from clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance reports, case studies, or a combination of these evidences. The drug label reflects a summary of known adverse reactions that have been sufficiently documented to warrant inclusion in the prescribing information.

For a more definitive assessment of the evidence, detailed investigation into clinical trial data, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance registries would be essential, as these would provide specifics such as incidence rates, the severity of liver injury, time to onset, and any risk factors associated with the reaction. Additionally, such resources would also potentially include details on whether liver damage was reversible upon discontinuation of the drug or the intervention required to manage the condition.

In conclusion, the drug label for phenobarbital acknowledges liver damage as an adverse reaction, suggesting evidence of a relationship between phenobarbital exposure and acute liver injury. However, more detailed information from clinical studies or case reports would be beneficial for a thorough understanding of this adverse effect.",NA
acute liver injury,phenytoin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and phenytoin exposure is outlined in the provided drug label under section 5.8, ""Hepatic Injury,"" and in the ""Digestive System"" subsection of adverse reactions.

Clinical Evidence:
1. **Hepatic Injury (Warnings and Precautions 5.8)**: The drug label indicates that cases of acute hepatotoxicity, which include infrequent instances of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with the use of phenytoin. It is also stated that these events can either be part of the spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions known as DRESS or may occur in isolation.

2. **Digestive System (Adverse Reactions)**: Listed under adverse reactions attributable to phenytoin's use are acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, and liver damage. These are categorized as part of the spectrum of possible adverse reactions to the drug based on clinical study observations or post-marketing reports.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:
In the ""Digestive System"" subsection, the drug label acknowledges reports of adverse hepatic events received post-marketing. Because reporting is voluntary and comes from a population of uncertain size, precise frequencies of the reactions or establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure are matters of uncertainty.

The label's instructions for immediate discontinuation of phenytoin upon the onset of acute hepatotoxicity underscore the established association between the drug and potential liver injury.

Additional Scientific and Clinical Context:
The specifics of the cases, including the time frame between drug exposure and the onset of symptoms, as well as the severity of the liver injury and any particular patterns in affected patient populations (e.g., underlying conditions, dosage, treatment duration) can provide further insight into the nature of this adverse reaction. Common manifestations associated with phenytoin-related hepatotoxicity include jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated serum transaminase levels.

The development of acute liver injury following phenytoin exposure is consistent with the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of the drug. The underlying mechanisms may be related to hypersensitivity or direct toxic effects of the drug or its metabolites. Monitoring liver function during phenytoin therapy is recommended in clinical practice due to the potential of hepatic adverse effects.

In conclusion, while the information directly from controlled clinical trials is limited, post-marketing reports and the information provided under the label's warnings and precautions imply a relationship between acute liver injury and phenytoin use. Health professionals are recommended to monitor liver function tests during phenytoin treatment and to be vigilant for signs of hepatic dysfunction.","NA

The label explicitly mentions ""Hepatic Injury"", indicating that there is evidence supporting a relationship between phenytoin exposure and acute liver injury, refuting the relationship is not applicable in this context. The drug label states ""Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue."" (Section 5.8 Hepatic Injury)."
acute liver injury,pilocarpine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions and warnings for pilocarpine, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as an observed or reported adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reactions according to clinical studies are related to ocular and visual effects, such as headache/browache, accommodative change, blurred vision, eye irritation, visual impairment, and eye pain. There is also cautionary advice for poor illumination, pre-existing retinal disease, iritis, primary congenital glaucoma, and contact lens wear, but again, no specific mention of hepatic or liver injury is included in these sections.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided from the specific sections of the drug label for pilocarpine, there is no known evidence at this time that supports the relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to pilocarpine. It would be essential to review the broader scientific literature, including case reports, post-marketing surveillance data, and other clinical evidence, to determine if any reports or studies have indicated such a relationship. If such evidence exists outside the drug label, then conclusions would need to be drawn from that data.

However, since the provided label sections do not report acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, we can explicitly state that, according to the drug label from pilocarpine, there is no known evidence of acute liver injury associated with its use as of the information cut-off for this model. It remains crucial to report suspected adverse reactions to medical authorities, as highlighted in the label, to ensure any emerging safety concerns are appropriately documented and investigated.",NA
acute liver injury,pioglitazone,1.0,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for pioglitazone, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. However, the label does include warnings and precautions regarding hepatic effects (section 5.3). It notes that there have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, but the causality to the drug cannot be confirmed from the reports.

In the hepatic effects section (5.3), the label states that there has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the controlled clinical trial database for pioglitazone. Additionally, a specific trial designed to evaluate serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation showed a lower incidence in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to those treated with glyburide.

It's worth emphasizing that the label mentions that increases in serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 0.3% of pioglitazone-treated patients in clinical trials. While this could suggest liver enzyme elevations, it does not necessarily indicate acute liver injury, and the label specifies that none of the pioglitazone-treated patients in the controlled clinical database had an ALT elevation with a corresponding total bilirubin increase indicative of severe liver injury.

In the postmarketing experience section (6.2), the label discusses cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure. However, due to the voluntary nature of post-approval adverse reaction reporting, it is difficult to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a clear causal relationship to pioglitazone exposure.

In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction, there is evidence of reported hepatic effects, including rare postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, and infrequent occurrences of ALT elevations in clinical trials. Patients are advised to undergo liver function testing before starting pioglitazone, and the medication should be used cautiously in individuals with liver abnormalities. If liver injury is suspected, pioglitazone should be discontinued. It is important to consider these findings in the broader context of the patient's condition and risk factors when prescribing pioglitazone.",NA
acute liver injury,pirfenidone,,"Evidence supports that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction associated with pirfenidone, based on clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

**Clinical Trials:**
Pirfenidone has been evaluated in over 1400 subjects in clinical trials, with more than 170 subjects exposed to the drug for more than 5 years. Across three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, involving 623 patients on a dosage of 2403 mg/day of pirfenidone, the incidence of liver enzyme elevations was higher in patients taking pirfenidone compared to those on placebo. Specifically, 3.7% of the pirfenidone group experienced ALT or AST elevations ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), versus 0.8% in the placebo group. Elevations ≥10 times the ULN were observed in 0.3% of the pirfenidone group, compared to 0.2% in the placebo group. These liver enzyme alterations were reversible upon dose modification or treatment discontinuation.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
In the post-marketing setting, cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including severe liver injury with fatal outcomes, have been reported with the use of pirfenidone. Because these reports are voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, the exact frequency of DILI associated with pirfenidone is difficult to estimate. However, this data suggests an association between pirfenidone and liver injury beyond what was observed in clinical trials.

**Labeling and Monitoring Recommendations:**
The drug label for pirfenidone includes warnings about the risk of elevated liver enzymes and DILI. It is recommended that ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels be monitored before and during treatment with pirfenidone. Should liver injury be suspected, dosage modifications or treatment interruption may be necessary.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and pirfenidone is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials and reinforced by post-marketing surveillance data. Liver function test monitoring is advised to mitigate this risk.",NA
acute liver injury,pirfenidone,,"The drug label for pirfenidone (brand name ESBRIET) provides evidence of a potential relationship between the drug and acute liver injury, supported by the findings from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In clinical trials, specifically the three Phase 3 trials included in the drug label, there was a noted increase in liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and bilirubin in patients treated with pirfenidone compared to placebo. Among those treated with the recommended daily dose of 2403 mg, 3.7% experienced elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), versus only 0.8% in the placebo group. Although these hepatic enzyme elevations were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation, and no cases of liver transplant or death due to liver failure related to pirfenidone were reported, the label underscores the potential risk of severe liver injury.

**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
The drug label also mentions adverse reactions identified during postapproval use of pirfenidone. While specific rates of incidence are not provided, given the nature of voluntary reporting, the post-marketing experience includes reports of increases in bilirubin in combination with ALT and AST increases, suggesting occurrences of liver injury among users of pirfenidone.

**Precautions:**
The Warnings and Precautions section of the drug label emphasizes the importance of monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) before and during treatment with pirfenidone, due to observed liver enzyme elevations in clinical trials. Guidelines for dosage adjustment and treatment interruption are provided in case of significant liver enzyme elevations, which shows the recognized risk of liver-related adverse effects.

Based on these sources, there is evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to support a relationship between pirfenidone exposure and acute liver injury. Health care professionals are advised to monitor liver function in patients taking pirfenidone and consider dose adjustments or discontinuation if significant liver enzyme elevations occur.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is indeed an adverse reaction associated with pirfenidone. Specifically, elevations in liver enzymes such as ALT and AST have been reported, which could be indicative of liver injury. The label explicitly mentions that ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with ESBRIET (pirfenidone) and that these elevations can be important predictors of severe liver injury. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and pirfenidone use; rather, the drug label acknowledges the potential for liver-related adverse reactions."
acute liver injury,piroxicam,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and piroxicam exposure is reflected in the labeling information provided under several sections:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):** While specific instances of acute liver injury are not detailed, it is mentioned that adverse reactions to piroxicam in clinical trials include elevations of liver enzymes, an indicator of potential liver dysfunction or damage. Since clinical trials are controlled environments, the rates of adverse reactions can differ from those seen in broader patient populations.

2. **Postmarketing Experience (6.2):** More pertinent evidence comes from the postmarketing experience, as hepatotoxicity, including elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, jaundice, and liver failure, has been reported. These reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, making it challenging to estimate frequency or definitively establish a causal relationship. However, the inclusion of these hepatic adverse reactions suggests that there is some association between piroxicam use and liver injury.

3. **Warnings and Precautions (5.3):** The section on hepatotoxicity warns of potential severe liver injury, including rare cases of fatal outcomes such as fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure associated with NSAIDs, including piroxicam. It advises monitoring for symptoms of liver disease and discontinuing piroxicam if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop.

4. **Box Warnings:** The box warning does not specifically mention hepatotoxicity but emphasizes the importance of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible to minimize risks, which implicitly includes the risk of liver injury.

In summary, although the evidence from clinical trials may not directly highlight acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, the postmarketing surveillance data and the warnings section provide evidence of a potential relationship between piroxicam use and acute liver injury. The label advises caution and monitoring for signs of liver toxicity, indicating recognition of this risk by health authorities based on the reported postmarketing adverse reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,polatuzumab vedotin,,"The provided drug label sections indicate that POLIVY (polatuzumab vedotin) can be associated with several adverse reactions, including hepatotoxicity, which is mentioned under Warnings and Precautions (5.7). Although acute liver injury is not explicitly listed under the adverse reactions or the hepatotoxicity subsection, the text does describe serious cases of hepatotoxicity consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin.

Specifically, within clinical trial experiences, it is noted that in recipients of POLIVY plus R-CHP (a combination therapy), Grade 3–4 elevation of ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) and AST (Aspartate aminotransferase) developed in 1.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively. While these data points do not call out acute liver injury per se, they do suggest potential liver damage, which can be a manifestation of acute liver injury.

From Study GO29365, which included patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas treated with POLIVY in combination therapies, Grade 3 and Grade 4 transaminase elevations each developed in 1.9% of patients. These elevations of liver enzymes are indicators of liver injury, which may also include acute liver injury.

Based on this information, we can infer that there is evidence from clinical trials that polatuzumab vedotin can cause hepatotoxicity, and this may manifest as acute liver injury in some patients. The direct term ""acute liver injury"" may not be used, but the described laboratory changes—such as elevations in liver transaminases—are consistent with liver injury that could include acute cases. Thus, the relationship between polatuzumab vedotin and potential liver injury, possibly acute, is supported by observed clinical trial adverse reactions.

No specific evidence from case studies or post-marketing surveillance is provided in the label sections you've shared. It would be necessary to review pharmacovigilance databases and the published literature for additional case reports and post-marketing data to fully understand the scope and details of the potential risk of acute liver injury associated with polatuzumab vedotin.",NA
acute liver injury,pomalidomide,,"The drug label for pomalidomide (POMALYST) provides explicit evidence of hepatotoxicity, which refers to chemical-driven liver damage, among the adverse reactions observed with its use. Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent approved for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and Kaposi sarcoma.

The hepatotoxicity section (Section 5.6 of the Warnings and Precautions) clearly states that hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with POMALYST. Additionally, elevations in liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin levels, have been observed. Monitoring liver function tests monthly is recommended, and the label advises that POMALYST should be stopped if liver enzyme elevations are noted until they return to baseline. Subsequent rechallenge with a lower dose may be considered depending on the circumstances.

Clinical trials data (Section 6.1) also show that increased ALT (a marker of liver injury) was one of the adverse reactions of pomalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma, although the frequency did not meet criteria to be considered a reaction for the category of event (i.e., all adverse events or Grade 3 or 4 adverse events). However, this does suggest there were observed instances of liver enzyme elevations in clinical trial participants.

The postmarketing experience (Section 6.2) has further identified hepatic failure and elevated liver enzymes during postapproval use of POMALYST. These reports are from voluntary notifications from a population of uncertain size. Although it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the nature of voluntary reporting, the inclusion of these terms in postmarketing surveillance provides supportive evidence of pomalidomide's potential to cause liver injury.

In summary, there is evidence from official drug labeling—including warnings and precautions, clinical trials experience, and postmarketing surveillance—that supports the relationship between acute liver injury and pomalidomide exposure. Monitoring liver function tests is recommended for patients on pomalidomide and discontinuation or dose modification may be required if liver toxicity is detected.",NA
acute liver injury,pomalidomide,,"The provided drug label for pomalidomide (Pomalyst) details various adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with its use. Specifically related to acute liver injury, the label mentions hepatotoxicity under section 5.6. It states that ""Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with POMALYST."" It also notes observed elevations in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin. The label recommends that liver function tests should be monitored monthly and that treatment should be stopped upon the elevation of liver enzymes followed by evaluation.

This information suggests that there is a relationship between pomalidomide and hepatotoxicity, which can manifest as acute liver injury. Specifically, cases of hepatic failure have occurred. This evidence is derived directly from the clinical experience with the medication, as observed in patients treated with pomalidomide. 

Further evidence of hepatic-related adverse effects can be inferred from the listed laboratory abnormalities in the post-marketing experience. The label notes ""Hepatic failure (including fatal cases), elevated liver enzymes"" as adverse reactions reported during postapproval use of POMALYST. These reactions are voluntarily reported, and while the frequency is uncertain, there is an implication of causality with drug exposure due to the reporting mechanism and the nature of the adverse events described.

There are no specific percentages of occurrence or detailed case studies provided in the label regarding acute liver injury. Additionally, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury in the clinical trials' data provided. However, elevations in liver enzymes and reports of hepatic failure in the context of drug exposure constitute relevant evidence supporting that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction of pomalidomide.

For a complete evaluation, it would be necessary to review the full clinical trial data, including any published peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and the overall incidence rates from post-marketing surveillance to determine the strength of the evidence supporting the relationship between pomalidomide and acute liver injury. Clinical practitioners should base their monitoring and intervention strategies on this documented adverse reaction in the provided prescribing information and ensure vigilant assessment of liver function during pomalidomide treatment.",NA
acute liver injury,ponatinib,,"There is evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury, a form of hepatotoxicity, and exposure to ponatinib, marketed as Iclusig. Here's a summary based on the provided drug label sections:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
- In the clinical trial OPTIC, of the 94 patients receiving a starting dose of 45 mg, the hepatotoxicity occurred in 28% of patients, with 6% experiencing Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity (severe). Median time to onset was 1.9 months (range: 3 days to 4.1 years).
- In the PACE trial, which evaluated the safety of ponatinib (45 mg starting dose) in patients with resistant or intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL, hepatotoxicity was observed in 32% of the 449 patients, with 13% experiencing severe (Grade 3 or 4) hepatotoxicity. Median time to onset was 3.1 months (range: 1 day to 4.9 years).
- Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in three patients. In one of these cases, hepatic failure occurred within one week of starting the drug.

**Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence:**
- Although not specifically for acute liver injury, postmarketing experience indicates that hepatotoxicity was identified as an adverse reaction during the post-approval use of Iclusig. The reports come from a population of uncertain size, making it challenging to estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure reliably.

**Drug Label Statements:**
- Hepatotoxicity, including severe cases, liver failure, and death, is listed in the warnings section of the Iclusig drug label, indicating an established risk of liver-related adverse reactions.
- The label advises monitoring liver function tests at baseline and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Depending on the severity, the recommendation is to interrupt, reduce the dose, or discontinue Iclusig.

Source of Evidence:
- The drug label from Iclusig, which includes sections on clinical trial experiences (sections 6.1 of OPTIC and PACE studies), postmarketing experience (section 6.2), and specific warnings and precautions (section 5.4) related to hepatotoxicity.

In conclusion, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data provide evidence that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction associated with the use of ponatinib (Iclusig). Liver-related adverse events ranging from elevated liver enzymes to severe hepatotoxicity, liver failure, and death have been documented, necessitating close monitoring of liver function in patients taking the drug.",NA
acute liver injury,ponatinib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ponatinib (brand name Iclusig) exposure includes data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicating hepatotoxicity as a noteworthy adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the OPTIC clinical trial of previously treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML), 28% of patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg ponatinib experienced hepatotoxicity, with 6% of these cases being Grade 3 or 4. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity was 1.9 months (range: 3 days to 4.1 years). Notably, 29% of the 21 patients who reported ALT or AST elevation did not have the event resolved by the date of the last follow-up.

In the PACE clinical trial, involving patients resistant or intolerant to prior kinase inhibitor therapy (including those with BCR-ABL T315I mutation), hepatotoxicity was reported in 32% of patients, with 13% experiencing Grade 3 or 4 events. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity was 3.1 months (range: 1 day to 4.9 years).

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label for Iclusig includes explicit warnings about hepatotoxicity, stating that liver failure and death have occurred. Hepatotoxicity is described as a potentially fatal outcome that clinicians need to monitor for via liver function tests, adjusting the dose or discontinuing use in severe cases. A specific recommendation is to monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Additionally, it's advised to interrupt, then possibly resume at reduced dose or discontinue Iclusig based on the severity of hepatotoxicity events.

Post-marketing Experience:
Post-marketing surveillance has also reported occurrences of hepatic failure and death. Although data from post-marketing surveillance is limited due to potential underreporting and the voluntary nature of this data, the inclusion of such events indicates observed occurrences beyond controlled clinical trial settings.

In summary, clinical trials have demonstrated a clear relationship between ponatinib treatment and hepatotoxicity, which can manifest as acute liver injury. The drug label includes warnings recommending close monitoring and provides guidance on managing hepatotoxicity. These findings highlight the need for vigilant liver function monitoring and readiness to modify or discontinue therapy in patients being treated with ponatinib.",NA
acute liver injury,ponesimod,,"The drug label information provided outlines various adverse reactions associated with the use of ponesimod, marketed under the brand name PONVORY, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Ponesimod is known to impact immune function and may lead to several adverse reactions of varying severity.

Regarding acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to ponesimod, the data from clinical trials is detailed in section 6.1, Clinical Trials Experience, and section 5.4, Liver Injury:

In section 6.1, it is reported that hepatic transaminase elevation was observed as one of the most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 10%) in PONVORY-treated patients in a study where 1438 MS patients received PONVORY (Clinical Studies, Study 1). Specific data indicate that 23% of PONVORY-treated patients experienced hepatic transaminase elevation compared to 12% on teriflunomide 14 mg.

In section 5.4, the label warns about liver injury and the need to obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with PONVORY. It indicates that elevation of ALT to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 17.3% of patients treated with PONVORY and that discontinuation rates due to elevations in hepatic enzymes were 2.3% for the PONVORY-treated group.

Additionally, section 5.4 advises healthcare providers to discontinue PONVORY if significant liver injury is confirmed and monitor patients for symptoms indicative of hepatic dysfunction.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials—that involved a total of 1438 MS patients and referenced in the provided drug label sections—indicates that acute liver injury, manifested by elevations in hepatic transaminase levels, is a potential adverse reaction to ponesimod treatment. These findings are supported by data indicating a higher occurrence of hepatic transaminase elevation among patients treated with PONVORY compared to those receiving an alternative MS medication, teriflunomide, and the need for discontinuation of PONVORY in some cases due to liver injury. The drug label mandates monitoring liver function before and during treatment with PONVORY and to discontinue the drug if significant liver injury occurs.

There are no specific mentions of case studies or post-marketing surveillance data on acute liver injury related to PONVORY in the provided sections of the drug label. For comprehensive safety evaluation, such sources of evidence can complement findings from clinical trials and help in understanding the real-world occurrence and management of adverse reactions.",NA
acute liver injury,posaconazole,1.0,"Evidence supports the association between posaconazole exposure and acute liver injury. The data can be summarized from clinical trial experiences and post-marketing surveillance:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: Hepatic toxicity, including mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and clinical hepatitis, have been reported in clinical trials with posaconazole. These adverse reactions were generally reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, although in some instances, liver tests normalized without interrupting the drug. However, more severe hepatic reactions such as cholestasis or hepatic failure, including deaths, have been reported, particularly in patients with serious underlying medical conditions such as hematologic malignancy and primarily in those receiving posaconazole oral suspension at a dose of 800 mg daily.

2. Post-Marketing Experience: While the post-marketing adverse reactions are voluntarily reported and the actual incidence rate is uncertain, adverse hepatic reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of posaconazole. This suggests ongoing occurrence of liver-related adverse effects outside of the clinical trial setting.

The evidence from the clinical trials demonstrates that hepatic dysfunction is a known adverse effect of posaconazole, which is emphasized in the drug's safety evaluation and monitoring recommendations. The occurrence of severe hepatic reactions and liver injury post-marketing also supports this relationship, although the spontaneous nature of the reports and the variable patient population make frequency estimation less reliable.

It should be noted that clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data are considered strong evidence due to the direct observation and reporting of adverse effects in patients exposed to the drug, respectively. Monitoring hepatic function at the start and during posaconazole therapy is recommended, and discontinuation should be considered in case of abnormal liver test results potentially attributable to the drug. The provided sections of the drug label confirm the association and the importance of monitoring as part of the therapy management.",NA
acute liver injury,pralatrexate,,"Evidence supporting the association of acute liver injury with pralatrexate (brand name FOLOTYN) primarily comes from clinical trials and safety evaluations of the drug as described in the drug label sections provided.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
The safety of pralatrexate was evaluated in 111 patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in a single-arm clinical study. Liver function test abnormalities were observed in 14 (13%) of the patients treated with FOLOTYN. Among these, Grade 3 liver function test abnormalities were reported in 6 patients (5%). The specifics of the liver injury, however, are not detailed beyond the notes on abnormal liver function tests, and the label does not explicitly classify these abnormalities as acute liver injury.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The drug label contains a specific warning about hepatic toxicity, noting that pralatrexate can lead to liver function test abnormalities and hepatic toxicity. The label instructs monitoring of liver function tests and advises that, in cases of Grade 3 or higher liver function test abnormalities, the dose should be omitted until recovery and the dosage adjusted or therapy discontinued based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity. This indicates that the drug has a known potential to cause significant liver damage.

**Post Marketing Experience:**
No specific cases of acute liver injury post-marketing have been mentioned in the provided label sections. However, the post-marketing experience is based on voluntary reports, which can be limited and not always representative of the entire patient population.

**Conclusion:**
While acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse event, the clinical trials suggest that liver function test abnormalities, which may indicate hepatic injury, can occur in patients receiving pralatrexate. The warnings and precautions section of the label further supports the potential for hepatic toxicity related to pralatrexate, although this does not confirm a direct relationship to acute liver injury without additional clinical details. No specific evidence from post-marketing surveillance has been provided to assess the frequency of acute liver injury in a broader patient population.

It is important to interpret these findings with caution due to the limitations of the data and the need for a thorough clinical assessment to establish a definitive causal relationship between pralatrexate and acute liver injury in individual cases.",NA
acute liver injury,pralatrexate,,"Based on the provided drug label excerpts for pralatrexate (FOLOTYN), there is evidence suggesting that hepatic toxicity, including acute liver injury, can be an adverse reaction to the use of this medication. The specifics can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trial Evidence:
- In a single-arm clinical trial of 111 patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTLC) treated with pralatrexate, liver function test abnormalities were observed in 14 patients (13% incidence rate), with grade 3 severity in 6 patients (5% incidence rate), but no grade 4 severity was reported.
- The median duration of treatment in this study was 70 days, with a range of 1-540 days.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- Post-marketing experience with pralatrexate includes voluntary reporting systems, so while precise rates cannot be easily determined, they can provide signals of potential adverse effects. The drug label does not specify post-marketing reports related to acute liver injury, but hepatic toxicity is mentioned in the Warnings and Precautions section.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The drug label advises monitoring for hepatic toxicity and states that liver function test abnormalities may be indicators of hepatic toxicity, requiring dose modification or discontinuation.
- For liver function test abnormalities graded 3 or higher, the recommendation is to omit the dose until recovery and then to either reduce the dose or discontinue therapy based on the severity of the toxicity.

In conclusion, evidence from a clinical trial suggests that pralatrexate can cause liver function test abnormalities, a proxy for liver injury, in a subset of patients. The drug's labeling also acknowledges hepatic toxicity as a risk and provides guidance for monitoring and management. While specific cases of acute liver injury are not detailed, liver toxicity is recognized as an important adverse effect to monitor during treatment with pralatrexate.",NA
acute liver injury,pralsetinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and drug exposure to pralsetinib (GAVRETO) is provided in section 5.3 of the drug's label. Hepatotoxicity is listed as a warning and precaution, indicating a recognized risk associated with pralsetinib use.

From the clinical trials experience, as per section 6.1 of the label, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were among the most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities. Grade 3-4 lab abnormalities refer to more severe conditions that can be clinically significant. Specifically, increased AST and ALT were observed in 7% and 4.8% of patients, respectively, who were treated with GAVRETO, representing potential biomarkers for liver injury.

The median time to the first onset of increased AST was 15 days, and for increased ALT was 24 days. These findings suggest a temporal relationship between pralsetinib administration and the occurrence of liver enzyme elevations.

In terms of recommendations for monitoring and management (section 5.3), the drug label advises regular monitoring of liver enzymes and stipulates specific actions to be taken (e.g., withholding dose, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of GAVRETO) based on the severity of liver enzyme elevations.

Overall, the inclusion of hepatotoxicity within the drug label warnings and precautions, the observed incidences of increased liver enzymes in clinical trials, and the guidance on monitoring and managing liver enzyme elevations all constitute evidence of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to pralsetinib.

No explicit mention of post-marketing surveillance evidence is provided in the drug label excerpt presented. However, the drug label encourages reporting of suspected adverse reactions which can contribute to post-marketing surveillance data. 

In summary, the evidence from clinical trial data cited in the drug label supports the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to pralsetinib, and it is recognized as a serious potential adverse reaction with specific monitoring and management recommendations provided for its detection and control.

acute liver injury,pravastatin,,"Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction to pravastatin based on the provided sections of the drug label. However, there is evidence suggesting an association between pravastatin and hepatic dysfunction, including increases in serum transaminases (ALT and AST), which could potentially lead to liver injury.

**Clinical Trials:** In the clinical trials mentioned in the provided label, persistent increases in serum transaminases occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving pravastatin. These elevations were transient in most cases, without accompanying symptoms, and resolved or improved with continued therapy or a brief pause in treatment.

**Postmarketing Surveillance:** The drug label also reports rare postmarketing instances of more serious hepatic adverse reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaicundice, cirrhosis, and hepatic failure, some cases leading to death. Even though these reports indicate hepatic damage, the exact incidence rate of such cases cannot be determined from postmarketing surveillance because these reactions are voluntarily reported and the total number of exposures is unknown.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Hepatic dysfunction is acknowledged in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label, indicating that increases in transaminases have been reported, and although rare, there have been reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure associated with statins, including pravastatin.

**Laboratory Abnormalities:** The drug label also notes laboratory abnormalities involving liver function test alterations, although specific details regarding acute liver injury are not provided.

In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not frequently reported as an adverse reaction to pravastatin in clinical trials or listed as a common adverse reaction, there is evidence of hepatic dysfunction, including increases in serum transaminases and rare but serious cases of hepatic failure in the postmarketing experience. These findings suggest that pravastatin can potentially cause liver-related adverse reactions, and monitoring liver enzyme levels before and during treatment is recommended. Health care providers should consider the risk of liver injury when evaluating the benefits and risks of pravastatin therapy in patients.",NA
acute liver injury,pretomanid,,"Evidence of a potential relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to pretomanid can be found in the adverse reactions and safety warnings sections of the drug label.

**Clinical Trials:**
In the registrational Trial 1 (NCT02333799), pretomanid was administered in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid to patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Of the patients treated, 28% experienced increased transaminases (ALT and AST), which are enzymes typically elevated when there is liver injury. Specific instances of elevated liver enzymes were noted, including >3 and ≤5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 6% of patients for ALT, >5 and ≤8 times ULN in 5%, and >8 times ULN in 1%. Similar instances were recorded for AST and slightly lower percentages for total bilirubin elevation. These laboratory abnormalities suggest a potential for hepatotoxicity.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The label explicitly mentions hepatic adverse reactions associated with the use of the combination regimen including pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid. Patients are monitored for symptoms of liver dysfunction and laboratory tests of liver enzymes. It is advised to interrupt treatment with the entire regimen if evidence of liver injury occurs, including significant elevation of aminotransferases or bilirubin.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
No specific data from post-marketing surveillance regarding acute liver injury related to pretomanid use were provided in the label. Post-marketing data often provides insights into adverse reactions once a drug is used in the general population, which may include cases of acute liver injury not detected in clinical trials.

**Summary:**
There is evidence from a clinical trial (Trial 1 - NCT02333799) suggesting a potential relationship between pretomanid exposure and acute liver injury, indicated by elevated liver enzyme levels in a significant percentage of patients. Further, the drug's label includes warnings about monitoring for hepatic adverse reactions, with recommendations to interrupt treatment if liver injury is suspected. No specific data from post-marketing surveillance is provided, so the prevalence of acute liver injury in the general patient population using pretomanid is not characterized beyond the clinical trial setting.

This assessment relies on the information provided in the drug label sections concerning adverse reactions, warnings, and hepatotoxicity related to the use of pretomanid, especially in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid. To fully confirm the relationship and understand the prevalence and severity of acute liver injury due to pretomanid, further analysis of post-marketing surveillance data and additional clinical or observational studies may be necessary.",NA
acute liver injury,probenecid,,"To summarize the evidence regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to probenecid, the adverse reactions section of the drug label specifically mentions hepatic necrosis as a potential adverse event. Hepatic necrosis is a severe form of liver injury which can lead to acute liver failure. The mention of hepatic necrosis in the adverse reactions section suggests that there have been instances where probenecid use has been associated with this severe liver injury.

However, the label does not provide specific details regarding the frequency of this adverse reaction, or under what circumstances (such as overdose or in patients with pre-existing liver conditions) it might occur. This categorization implies that hepatic necrosis has been observed post-marketing or possibly during clinical trials, but the exact source of evidence (whether from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance) is not specified in the label excerpt provided.

To substantiate the evidence, one would typically look for:

1. Clinical Trials: Data from clinical studies that included probenecid where liver function tests were monitored, and instances of acute liver injury were reported.

2. Case Studies: Reports in the medical literature of patients who have developed acute liver injury following the administration of probenecid.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: Reports from healthcare professionals and patients submitted to national drug safety databases, which monitor adverse drug reactions in the wider population after a drug has been approved for use.

Since the drug label's adverse reactions section is based on observed events, it serves as a signal that acute liver injury has been reported in relation to probenecid use. However, without access to detailed clinical data, case reports, or the frequency of such reports from post-marketing surveillance, it is difficult to establish the strength of this relationship or to provide a risk assessment. Future research including epidemiological studies, case-control studies, or more detailed analysis of post-marketing data could further clarify this relationship.

In summary, the evidence supporting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to probenecid is acknowledged by its inclusion as hepatic necrosis in the adverse reactions section of the medication label, though specific details and the strength of this evidence are not provided in the information you shared. Additional studies and reports would aid in better understanding the causality and incidence of this serious adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,procainamide,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and procainamide exposure is documented in the drug label provided. Specifically, under the ""Adverse Reactions"" section, it is reported that elevated liver enzymes, including transaminases, sometimes with concomitant elevations of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, have been noted in individuals taking procainamide. Additionally, some patients have experienced clinical symptoms consistent with liver injury, such as malaise and right upper quadrant pain. Moreover, the drug label notes that there have been reports of deaths from liver failure associated with procainamide, indicating a potential causative link between the drug exposure and severe liver injury.

The adverse reactions section directly lists ""Elevated Liver Enzymes"" as an adverse event, which can be an indicator of acute liver injury. The inclusion of this reaction, along with the associated clinical symptoms and the extreme outcome of liver failure leading to death, provides clear evidence that a relationship between acute liver injury and procainamide exposure exists. 

However, the label doesn't provide a detailed incidence rate, nor does it mention specific clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data that would offer a robust quantification of the risk. It is also important to note that drug labels often include adverse reactions reported during post-marketing surveillance without detailed epidemiological data, relying on case reports and clinical judgment instead.

In conclusion, the drug label for procainamide acknowledges elevated liver enzymes and acute liver injury as potential adverse reactions to the drug, with clinical manifestations and rare instances of fatal outcomes. This constitutes evidence of a link between acute liver injury and procainamide exposure. However, because detailed clinical trial data and specific post-marketing surveillance figures are not provided in the label, the extent and characterization of these risks in the general population remain less clearly defined.","NA

The information provided does not include evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and procainamide exposure. On the contrary, the Adverse Reactions section of the drug label explicitly mentions that elevated liver enzymes are a reported adverse reaction to procainamide. It also states that some patients have experienced clinical symptoms like malaise and right upper quadrant pain, and that deaths from liver failure have been reported. Given this information, there is no basis provided to dispute the relationship between acute liver injury and procainamide exposure; instead, the evidence supports the existence of such an adverse reaction."
acute liver injury,prochlorperazine,,"The available evidence from the drug label for prochlorperazine maleate indicates that there are several recognized adverse reactions associated with its use; however, acute liver injury is not prominently featured among the listed common adverse reactions such as drowsiness, dizziness, amenorrhea, blurred vision, skin reactions, and hypotension. The label does mention cholestatic jaundice and the occurrence of fatty changes in the liver in some patients who have died while receiving the drug, but explicitly states that ""no causal relationship has been established."" This suggests that while there is some indication of hepatic adverse events, a direct causal link between prochlorperazine and acute liver injury has not been definitively confirmed within the context of the drug label.

The label also provides warnings regarding several serious adverse reactions including Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), extrapyramidal reactions, and blood dyscrasias (such as leukopenia and agranulocytosis). It indicates that patients who present with fever and grippe-like symptoms should undergo appropriate liver studies, and the treatment must be stopped if there is evidence of liver abnormality, indicating a recognition of potential hepatic risks.

In terms of specifics to acute liver injury, which may include conditions like hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, or a mix of both, the drug label advises discontinuation of prochlorperazine if tests indicate liver abnormalities. Therefore, while the drug label suggests monitoring for liver issues, which could include acute liver injury, it does not provide sufficient details to establish a proven relationship.

To summarize, according to the provided drug label information, there is acknowledgment of potential liver related adverse effects when using prochlorperazine, but the evidence within the label does not conclusively establish acute liver injury as a common or well-characterized adverse effect. Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for signs of liver dysfunction and discontinue use if liver test abnormalities are detected. For more definitive evidence of a causal link between prochlorperazine and acute liver injury, additional sources such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data would need to be reviewed.",NA
acute liver injury,progesterone,,"The evidence provided within the drug label sections does not explicitly report acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed during the clinical trials conducted with progesterone capsules. The adverse reactions listed in the provided sections primarily pertain to symptoms such as headache, breast tenderness, joint pain, depression, dizziness, and other non-hepatic issues. However, in the postmarketing experience section, there are reports of hepatic-related adverse reactions such as acute pancreatitis, cholestasis, cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, increased liver function tests, and jaundice. These hepatic adverse reactions are indicative of significant liver injury which may include acute liver injury, although the label does not use the exact term ""acute liver injury.""

It is important to note that postmarketing experiences are voluntarily reported and represent a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the exact frequency of such reactions or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure definitively. In conclusion, although acute liver injury is not directly listed in the clinical trial adverse reactions, there is evidence from postmarketing surveillance that progesterone may be associated with serious liver-related adverse events, which could potentially include acute liver injury.

To further assess the relationship between progesterone and acute liver injury, it would be necessary to review additional sources such as published case reports, epidemiological studies, or further research that might provide more conclusive evidence. However, based on the available information in the drug label, it is reasonable to suggest vigilance in monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction or injury when patients are treated with progesterone, especially considering the reported hepatic adverse reactions in the postmarketing setting.","Based on the provided drug label information, there is no explicit mention or evidence suggesting that acute liver injury is an adverse reaction related to the use of progesterone. The reported adverse reactions in the postmarketing experience section include various hepatic conditions such as acute pancreatitis, cholestasis, cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, increased liver function tests, and jaundice. However, acute liver injury as a specific term is not reported.

It's important to note that while the drug label mentions conditions that affect liver health, the absence of a specific mention of acute liver injury doesn't completely refute the possibility of this adverse reaction. Nevertheless, without explicit reported cases or a statistically significant incidence in comparison to a control group (either within clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance), it can be suggested that there is no clear evidence presented in this label to support acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to progesterone. 

Evaluating the relationship between drug exposure and potential adverse reactions typically involves examining clinical trial data, postmarketing reports, pharmacovigilance databases, and medical literature for reported cases or studies of interest. Since the drug label provided does not mention acute liver injury specifically, no affirmative evidence is presented to support its association with progesterone use in the materials provided."
acute liver injury,propafenone,,"Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury and Propafenone:

Acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials section (6.1) of the drug label for propafenone. The most frequently reported adverse events are related to gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems, with a particular emphasis on unusual taste, nausea and/or vomiting, dizziness, and constipation.

However, postmarketing experience (section 6.2), which reflects voluntary reports from a broader patient population after the drug has been approved, does provide some evidence for acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction associated with propafenone. The label mentions that a number of patients with liver abnormalities following propafenone therapy have been reported. These manifestations ranged from hepatocellular injury to a mixed picture including cholestasis. Some cases were identified through clinical symptoms, while others were discovered via routine clinical chemistries. The severity reported varied, with some cases leading to fulminant hepatitis and death. There is also at least one documented case rechallenge, which offers stronger evidence of a causal relationship between propafenone exposure and liver injury. Rechallenge refers to the re-introduction of a drug after a suspected adverse reaction, where a positive result (recurrence of the symptom) can help confirm the drug's role in the adverse effect.

In this case, the postmarketing reports suggest that propafenone can be associated with liver injury, possibly as a rare adverse effect. This association is further supported by the drug label's warning (section 5.9) regarding careful monitoring of patients with hepatic (liver) dysfunction, as propafenone is metabolized by the liver and liver disease can increase bioavailability, implying that the liver is affected by the drug's metabolism and potentially susceptible to injury.

In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not highlighted as a frequent adverse event in controlled clinical trials of propafenone, postmarketing data provide evidence that propafenone can be associated with acute liver injury, ranging from mild enzyme elevations to fulminant hepatitis, albeit likely as a rare occurrence. Healthcare professionals should monitor liver function tests in patients receiving propafenone and consider the risk of liver injury, especially in those with pre-existing liver conditions or those exhibiting symptoms consistent with hepatic dysfunction.",NA
acute liver injury,propoxyphene,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and propoxyphene exposure can be found within the 'Hepatobiliary disorder' section of the reported post-marketing adverse events detailed in the drug label. It mentions ""hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, hepatocellular injury"" as adverse events, which are consistent with liver injury. Additionally, the label specifies that propoxyphene therapy has been associated with abnormal liver function tests and, more rarely, reversible jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice).

No specific incidences or statistical data from clinical trials or case studies are provided in the drug label excerpts. However, the inclusion of liver-related adverse effects in the post-marketing surveillance section, such as hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular injury, supports the notion that propoxyphene has the potential to cause liver damage in some patients. The reference to instances of reversible jaundice further substantiates this connection, as jaundice is often a sign of liver dysfunction. 

The evidence presented is drawn from post-marketing surveillance, which involves monitoring the safety of a pharmaceutical drug or medical device after it has been released on the market. Post-marketing surveillance can provide insight into rare, serious, and long-term adverse reactions that may not have been evident during clinical trials.

As the information does not detail the frequency, clinical course, or outcomes of the liver injury cases, or measures such as incidence rates or relative risk, the strength of the association cannot be conclusively determined from this summary alone.

Given that this information comes from the drug label, it has been vetted by healthcare regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), based on the collection of adverse event reports. This enhances the credibility of the association between propoxyphene and acute liver injury. However, for a more comprehensive assessment, further investigation involving peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and clinical data would be required.",NA
acute liver injury,propylthiouracil,1.0,"Acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of propylthiouracil, an antithyroid medication commonly used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The evidence supporting this adverse reaction comes from various sources:

1. Clinical Trials: While specific detailed results from clinical trials might not be available in the provided text, adverse reactions are typically reported during pre-marketing clinical trials. However, due to the rarity of severe liver injury, it may not have been observed in clinical trials, or the trials may not have been large enough to adequately assess the frequency of such a rare event.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance: The evidence cited in the drug label mainly comes from post-marketing surveillance, which includes voluntary reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and patients after the drug is available on the market. Although this kind of reporting system has limitations, such as underreporting and lack of causal relationship establishment, it has noted severe adverse reactions, including hepatic injury manifesting as hepatitis, liver failure necessitating liver transplantation, or resulting in death.

3. Box Warnings and Warnings: The drug label includes severe warnings, which are reflective of the strong evidence regarding the risk of liver injury. The presence of a box warning (the strongest warning required by the FDA) indicates that medical literature and post-marketing reports have substantiated the risk of severe liver injury related to propylthiouracil use. This risk includes reports of fatal outcomes and the need for liver transplantation in both adult and pediatric patients.

4. Case Studies and Reviews: Case studies in the medical literature are another source of evidence. These typically provide detailed clinical information about patients who have experienced severe liver injury following propylthiouracil treatment. While not mentioned specifically in the provided text, such case studies often help in understanding the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of drug-related liver injuries.

In summary, the relationship between propylthiouracil and acute liver injury is supported by post-marketing surveillance data and strongly emphasized in the drug's box warning. This indicates that although acute liver injury is a rare adverse reaction, it can be severe and potentially fatal, leading to the recommendation that propylthiouracil be reserved for specific circumstances where other treatments are not suitable.","NA

The available evidence from the drug label indicates that acute liver injury is indeed a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of propylthiouracil. It has been reported to occur and, in some severe instances, has led to liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation or resulting in death. As such, no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and propylthiouracil exposure is provided in this context."
acute liver injury,pyrazinamide,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and pyrazinamide exposure is derived from various sources, including the drug label, clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

Drug Label:
The drug label for pyrazinamide explicitly mentions hepatotoxicity as a principal adverse effect, indicating that liver injury is a recognized complication of this medication. It is stated that hepatotoxicity appears to be dose-related and can occur at any time during therapy, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring.

Clinical Trials:
Clinical trials involving pyrazinamide have documented hepatotoxicity as a significant adverse event. For instance, studies have shown an association between pyrazinamide use and the elevation of liver enzymes, a potential indicator of liver injury. Clinical trials are an important source of evidence as they provide controlled environments to assess the incidence and severity of adverse reactions, including liver injury.

Case Studies:
Individual case studies and case series in the medical literature have reported acute liver injury in patients treated with pyrazinamide. These case reports provide detailed clinical information on the onset, progression, and resolution of liver injury after the administration of pyrazinamide. Such reports enhance the understanding of the clinical presentation and management of drug-induced liver injury.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
After the approval and widespread use of pyrazinamide, post-marketing surveillance has identified hepatic reactions as adverse events. This surveillance can capture a broader range of real-world experiences, including rare and severe instances of liver toxicity that might not have been evident during pre-approval clinical trials.

The evidence from these sources collectively supports the conclusion that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction of pyrazinamide. It is important to note that while hepatotoxicity is associated with pyrazinamide, individual patient factors, comorbidities, and concomitant medications may also influence the risk and severity of liver injury.

It is recommended for healthcare professionals to monitor liver function regularly in patients receiving pyrazinamide, and for patients to be informed about the symptoms of liver damage and instructed to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity.","NA

The adverse reactions section of the drug label explicitly states that hepatic reactions are a principal adverse effect of pyrazinamide, which includes the potential for hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is dose-related and can occur at any time during therapy. This suggests that acute liver injury is indeed recognized as an adverse reaction to pyrazinamide, and thus, there is no evidence to refute the relationship between acute liver injury and pyrazinamide exposure."
acute liver injury,quetiapine,,"Based on the provided labeling information for quetiapine, acute liver injury is not listed as a commonly observed adverse reaction in clinical trials, nor is it included under the warnings and precautions. The provided sections of the drug label mention increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults, cerebrovascular adverse reactions, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), metabolic changes, tardive dyskinesia, hypotension, leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, cataracts, QT prolongation, seizures, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, potential for cognitive and motor impairment, dysphagia, anticholinergic effects, increases in blood pressure in children and adolescents, and concerns regarding discontinuation syndrome.

In the clinical studies section (6.1), the most common adverse reactions associated with quetiapine are mentioned, including somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain, postural hypotension, pharyngitis, weight gain, lethargy, increased ALT levels, and dyspepsia. Elevated ALT levels indicate a potential effect on liver function, but this is not necessarily indicative of acute liver injury.

Under the postmarketing experience section (6.2), ""serious liver reactions (including hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure)"" are listed among the adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of quetiapine. Although these postmarketing reports provide some evidence that acute liver injury can occur with quetiapine use, they also state that because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not a highlighted concern in the provided sections of quetiapine's labeling, there have been postmarketing reports of serious liver reactions associated with its use. Consequently, the evidence for a potential relationship between acute liver injury and quetiapine exposure comes from postmarketing surveillance and is less robust than evidence from controlled clinical trials. Healthcare providers are advised to monitor liver function as part of the overall clinical assessment in patients who are treated with quetiapine.",NA
acute liver injury,quinapril,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for quinapril, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data provided. However, ""abnormal liver function tests"" and ""hepatitis"" are listed under the ""General"" section of clinical adverse experiences that are either probably, possibly, or definitely related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in patients treated with quinapril. These terms can be indicative of liver issues, which may include acute liver injury, though such terminology does not specify the extent or severity of liver impairment.

Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and quinapril, based on the provided sections, would thus be considered indirect, as liver-related adverse reactions have been noted but are not explicitly stated as ""acute liver injury."" In clinical practice, abnormal liver function tests may prompt further investigation into the specific nature of the liver injury, which could potentially uncover cases of acute liver injury upon more detailed examination.

Moreover, the ""WARNINGS"" section does not specify liver-related issues except for fetal toxicity concerns. Given the absence of explicit evidence or detailed data in the provided text regarding acute liver injury as a consequence of quinapril use, it is not possible to conclusively summarize a direct correlation between the two.

Should this be a topic of concern or of clinical significance, further investigation into sources such as the scientific literature, case reports, or expanded post-marketing data would be required to provide a more definitive summary regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and quinapril exposure. It is also essential to monitor for this potential adverse reaction in clinical settings, especially in patients presenting with symptoms indicative of liver dysfunction.",NA
acute liver injury,quinidine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is some evidence suggesting a relationship between acute liver injury and quinidine exposure. Although the label mentions that quinidine preparations have been used for years with only sparse data on the incidence of various adverse reactions, it does acknowledge reported cases of hepatotoxicity, including granulomatous hepatitis, which is a form of liver injury. These cases have reportedly appeared during the first few weeks of therapy with quinidine. Furthermore, it indicates that most, but not all, cases of hepatotoxicity remitted after discontinuation of quinidine therapy.

The evidence includes:

1. Post-Marketing Surveillance: The label reflects post-marketing reports of hepatotoxicity. These reports often come from healthcare professionals, patients, or the pharmaceutical company and represent a form of passive surveillance for adverse drug reactions occurring in the general population.

2. Case Studies: The reference to ""a few cases of hepatotoxicity"" implies that there have been specific instances documented where patients experienced liver injury after taking quinidine. Such case studies can provide insight into the potential relationship between a drug and an adverse reaction, although they are generally not as robust as data from controlled studies.

No specific clinical trials are mentioned in the label sections provided that quantify the risk or incidence of acute liver injury with quinidine. The absence of detailed clinical trial data could be due to the historical use of the drug before more rigorous monitoring and documentation practices were implemented.

In conclusion, while the evidence presented in the drug label is limited and primarily consists of post-marketing reports and case studies, it does suggest a potential relationship between acute liver injury and quinidine exposure, particularly when such adverse reactions present early in treatment and resolve after discontinuation of the drug. However, due to the nature of the data (sparse and based on potentially under-reported post-marketing surveillance), these signals would benefit from further investigation through well-designed clinical studies to establish a definitive causal relationship.","Based on the provided drug label sections for quinidine, the evidence presented does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure; in fact, it acknowledges that ""a few cases of hepatotoxicity, including granulomatous hepatitis, have been reported in patients receiving quinidine."" These cases appeared within the first few weeks of therapy and were reversible on withdrawal of the drug. No specific incidence rate or comparative data with a control group (e.g., placebo or no treatment) is provided in the label to support a lack of relationship.

Given that the label itself reports cases of hepatotoxicity, there is no presented evidence to refute the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction and quinidine use. It is therefore not applicable (NA) to provide evidence against this notable association since the label itself acknowledges the occurrence of such adverse reactions, albeit rarely."
acute liver injury,quinine,,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and quinine exposure is derived from post-marketing surveillance reports as indicated in the drug label sections provided. Acute liver injury is listed under the ""Hepatobiliary"" adverse reactions section, where it is mentioned that adverse reactions such as granulomatous hepatitis, hepatitis, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests have been reported in association with quinine use.

As these observations are from post-marketing voluntary reports, the exact frequency and the causal relationship of acute liver injury due to quinine exposure is not clearly established. In the pharmacovigilance context, such associations rely on the spontaneous reporting of adverse reactions by healthcare providers and patients, which has known limitations including underreporting and absence of control groups for comparison. Therefore, while there is an indication of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to quinine, the evidence is not as robust as that from controlled clinical trials.

The label does not appear to provide any specific data from clinical trials regarding acute liver injury related to quinine, nor does it include detailed case studies about this particular adverse reaction. Moreover, the sections provided do not mention any Boxed Warning related specifically to hepatobiliary adverse reactions, suggesting that while acute liver injury is a recognized potential adverse event, it may not be among the most severe risks associated with quinine when compared to hematologic reactions which do have such warnings.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and quinine exposure is supported by post-marketing surveillance data indicating a possible association. However, due to the limitations of this type of evidence, the causality and incidence rate cannot be precisely determined without further controlled studies or detailed case reports that thoroughly evaluate this specific adverse reaction in the context of quinine use.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is not refuted as an adverse reaction to quinine. Instead, hepatobiliary disorders such as granulomatous hepatitis, hepatitis, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests are listed as potential adverse reactions, which suggests that there is at least some evidence or suspicion linking quinine with adverse effects on the liver. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to claim that evidence refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and quinine exposure when the drug label itself lists hepatobiliary adverse reactions."
acute liver injury,raltegravir,,"The provided drug label sections for raltegravir, known by its brand name ISENTRESS, detail a variety of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing experience but do not explicitly mention acute liver injury as one of them.

In the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from the clinical trials, there are mentions of increased liver enzymes such as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST). These enzyme elevations can be indicators of liver stress or damage and are used in clinical practice to monitor liver function. Specifically, for ISENTRESS, elevated ALT and AST levels were more frequent in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection, revealing that the drug might worsen liver function in patients with pre-existing liver conditions.

However, acute liver injury typically refers to a rapid onset of liver damage that can be life-threatening. The label mentions hepatic failure as an adverse reaction identified during post-marketing surveillance but does not specify the frequency or the establishment of a causal relationship with ISENTRESS.

The sections concerning warnings and precautions do include discussion about severe skin reactions and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by systemic findings and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. It advises monitoring liver aminotransferases and initiating appropriate therapy if these reactions develop.

To summarize, while the evidence from the label does not explicitly state acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, there is mention of hepatic failure in the post-marketing experience and literature does suggest that raltegravir can be associated with liver enzyme elevations, which might indicate potential for liver injury. The possibility of liver-related adverse events seems higher in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or hepatitis co-infection. However, the evidence does not provide a clear and consistent association specifically with acute liver injury, and any such occurrences are likely rare given they are not prominently reported in the clinical trial data.

It should be noted that the absence of detailed evidence about acute liver injury does not mean that the risk is non-existent, but rather that it may not have been a frequently reported or characterized outcome during the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance at the time of label writing. Health care providers are advised to monitor liver function in patients taking ISENTRESS, especially in those with a history of liver disease or hepatitis co-infection.",NA
acute liver injury,ranitidine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ranitidine, there is evidence suggesting an association between ranitidine use and acute liver injury. Specifically, the label mentions occasional reports of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed hepatitis, with or without jaundice. The circumstances under which these hepatic events occurred are not entirely clear, but there is an indication that ranitidine should be discontinued immediately if such events are observed. These hepatic adverse events are described as usually reversible, but there have been rare instances where death has occurred. Additionally, rare cases of hepatic failure after ranitidine exposure have been reported.

Further evidence from the label points to elevated liver enzymes in normal volunteers who received ranitidine intravenously. Specifically, SGPT levels were increased to at least twice the pretreatment levels in a subset of subjects receiving 100 mg intravenously four times daily for 7 days, and in subjects receiving 50 mg intravenously four times daily for 5 days. This laboratory finding suggests that ranitidine can have a direct effect on liver function.

However, the label also notes that the relationship between these adverse hepatic events and ranitidine therapy has been unclear in many cases. This acknowledgment indicates that, while there have been reports of liver injury, causality has not been definitively established through controlled clinical trials.

It is important to mention that the drug label does not provide detailed information on the methodology or the size of the studies, which are necessary to thoroughly evaluate the strength of the evidence. Additionally, there is no mention of the frequency of these adverse reactions compared to a control population, which could help quantify the risk.

In summary, the drug label for ranitidine indicates that there have been occasional reports of various forms of liver injury, including hepatitis and hepatic failure, sometimes with fatal outcomes. There is also evidence from a small clinical study suggesting ranitidine can cause elevated SGPT levels. However, the evidence does not clearly establish causality between ranitidine and liver injury, and more rigorous studies would be required to confirm this relationship. The sources of the evidence are mainly post-marketing reports, which are less controlled than clinical trial data, and as such, should be interpreted with caution.",NA
acute liver injury,rasagiline,,"The provided sections of the drug label for rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, primarily describe various adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with its use. However, acute liver injury is not mentioned in the sections provided, which cover clinical trials experience and postmarketing experience, as well as specific warnings and precautions related to different adverse reactions.

From the given information, it appears there is no evidence presented in the provided label sections that explicitly link rasagiline to acute liver injury either in clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance.

The label does include a section (5.5 Hepatic Impairment) that advises caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment and recommends dosing adjustments. It also states rasagiline should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. This indicates a recognition that the drug's metabolism may be affected by liver function but does not directly suggest that rasagiline has been observed to cause acute liver injury.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the drug label, there is no indicated evidence supporting a relationship between rasagiline and acute liver injury. Additional data from sources outside the provided label information would be required to establish such a connection. If studies or case reports outside the provided label sections do exist that suggest a link between rasagiline and acute liver injury, a review of those specific studies would be necessary to summarize the evidence accurately.","NA

The provided label information does not indicate acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction to rasagiline. No evidence is provided within the label sections that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and rasagiline, and it seems that acute liver injury is not typically considered an adverse reaction for this drug based on the information given. 

For a comprehensive evaluation, it would be necessary to consult scientific literature, clinical trial data, and post-marketing surveillance outside of the drug label to determine if there is any evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and rasagiline. If such evidence were available, it would typically include epidemiological studies, case-control studies, clinical trial data that specifically investigate hepatic function and outcomes, or analyses of post-marketing surveillance reports that do not demonstrate an association between rasagiline and acute liver injury. Without such evidence provided here, the summary is limited to the statement that acute liver injury is not listed as an adverse reaction to rasagiline in the provided drug label information."
acute liver injury,regorafenib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and drug exposure to regorafenib is multifaceted, including data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings mentioned in the drug labeling.

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
Clinical trials have reported serious adverse reactions of hepatotoxicity with regorafenib use. This evidence is presented in the adverse reactions section of the drug label, reflecting exposure to regorafenib in more than 4800 patients who were enrolled in various clinical trials, including randomized, placebo-controlled trials such as CORRECT, GRID, RESORCE, and CONCUR.

In the CORRECT trial, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 1.6% of patients in the regorafenib arm. The GRID trial reported fatal hepatic failure in 0.8% of patients receiving regorafenib. Elevated liver function tests, indicative of potential liver injury, were seen in clinical trials and necessitated monitoring liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to initiation and regularly during treatment.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
Hepatotoxicity has been identified during the post-approval use of regorafenib. Because these data are reported voluntarily and originate from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency. However, severe and sometimes fatal cases of hepatotoxicity reported in post-marketing surveillance further substantiate the relationship between liver injury and regorafenib exposure.

3. Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label includes a boxed warning, which is the FDA's strictest warning, indicating that severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity has occurred in clinical trials. This warning emphasizes the need for monitoring hepatic function before and during regorafenib treatment. The Warnings and Precautions section (5.1) also details the risk of hepatotoxicity, noting that severe drug-induced liver injury with a fatal outcome has been observed in patients treated with regorafenib. The drug should be withheld, and then the dose reduced or discontinued based on the severity and duration of hepatotoxicity.

In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and regorafenib comprises reports of fatal hepatic failure in clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance data, and explicit warnings in the drug labeling that highlight the serious risk of hepatotoxicity during treatment. Monitoring hepatic function before and during treatment with regorfenib is crucial due to the potential severity of liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,regorafenib,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for regorafenib (Stivarga), there is evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- In the CORRECT study, hepatotoxicity manifested as elevated liver function tests or hepatocellular necrosis led to dose interruptions, dose reductions, or discontinuation. Fatal hepatic failure occurred in 1.6% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 0.4% of patients in the placebo arm.
- Similar evidence of hepatotoxicity was noted in the GRID and RESORCE studies with instances of fatal hepatic failure in the treatment group (regorafenib arm).
- Monitoring liver function tests before initiation and closely during treatment is recommended due to observed hepatotoxicity.
- Liver dysfunction often presented within the first 2 months of therapy and was characterized by a hepatocellular pattern of injury.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- There is mention of severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity occurring in the post-marketing experience. However, the frequency or a causal relationship to regorafenib exposure is not reliably estimable due to the voluntary nature of these reports.

Warnings:
- The drug label contains a boxed warning regarding severe and potentially fatal hepatotoxicity.
- The label advises that liver function tests should be monitored before and during treatment with regorafenib.
- In cases of hepatotoxicity manifested by elevated liver function tests or hepatocellular necrosis, the recommendation is to interrupt treatment and then either reduce the dose or discontinue regorafenib depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity.

The evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicates that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction to regorafenib, and the drug's label reflects this with explicit warnings and precautions for monitoring and managing this risk.",NA
acute liver injury,remdesivir,,"The information provided in the drug label describes various adverse reactions associated with the use of remdesivir (VEKLURY), including hepatic laboratory abnormalities such as increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which can indicate acute liver injury. The evidence for this potential adverse reaction can be summarized from the clinical trials and laboratory studies included in the product labeling:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience in Adults with COVID-19**:
   - The NIAID ACTT-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, reported that subjects treated with remdesivir experienced Grade ≥3 adverse reactions related to increased ALT (3%) and AST (6%), indicating significant liver enzyme elevations.
   - In Study GS-US-540-5773, an open-label trial in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19, adverse reactions were noted in 17-20% of subjects, including increased AST (3%-6%) and ALT (2%-7%).
   - Study GS-US-540-5774 recorded adverse reactions in subjects with moderate COVID-19, finding that ALT elevations occurred in 2-3% of the subjects treated with remdesivir.
   - Laboratory abnormalities in studies NIAID ACTT-1, 5773, and 5774 indicated increased ALT, AST, and bilirubin in some participants, all of which may reflect hepatic injury.

2. **Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects**:
   - Study GS-US-540-5823 involving pediatric subjects treated with remdesivir highlighted that ALT increases (6%) were the most common adverse reaction.

3. **Emergency Use Authorization Experience**:
   - During the Emergency Use Authorization, transaminase elevations, an indicator of liver injury, were identified as an adverse reaction.

4. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   - The labeling specifically warns about the increased risk of transaminase elevations, advising monitoring of hepatic laboratory testing before and during remdesivir treatment. It suggests discontinuing remdesivir if ALT levels increase to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal or if accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation.

5. **Laboratory Abnormalities**:
   - A Phase 1 clinical trial (GS-US-399-5505) in healthy volunteers demonstrated mild to moderate elevations in ALT after 10 days of remdesivir treatment; these resolved upon discontinuation of the drug.

In summary, data from well-controlled clinical trials and observations in practice suggest an association between remdesivir treatment and elevated liver enzymes, which can be indicative of acute liver injury. This evidence is supported by the labeling's clinical trials experience, laboratory abnormality findings, warnings and precautions, and post-marketing surveillance. Health practitioners should monitor hepatic enzymes and consider the risk of liver injury when prescribing remdesivir.",NA
acute liver injury,repaglinide,,"There is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction related to the use of repaglinide in the provided drug label sections. The most common adverse reactions listed for repaglinide, including hypoglycemia, upper respiratory infections, headache, sinusitis, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, and back pain, do not include hepatic adverse effects.

Regarding liver-related adverse events, under section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience), ""severe hepatic dysfunction including jaundice and hepatitis"" is mentioned as an identified adverse reaction. These reports come from post-approval use of repaglinide tablets and are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, making it difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Additionally, under section 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience), among the less common adverse clinical or laboratory events observed in clinical trials (<1% of patients), elevated liver enzymes were noted. While this could hypothetically be associated with liver injury, there is no specific indication that these instances were categorized as acute liver injury, nor is there an indication of their severity or outcome.

In the context of clinical trials data and post-marketing surveillance, the evidence pointing to acute liver injury specifically as an adverse reaction to repaglinide is limited and not well defined. Reported severe hepatic dysfunction in the post-marketing experience suggests a potential risk, but without detailed case studies or clear incidence rates, the evidence to establish a definitive causal relationship between repaglinide exposure and acute liver injury is not robust.

Healthcare professionals rely on clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and case reports to monitor and assess drug safety. The absence of detailed information suggests that acute liver injury either occurs infrequently or is underreported in association with repaglinide use. Further investigation, such as targeted studies or analyses of larger datasets, may be required to better understand the risk of acute liver injury with repaglinide treatment.",NA
acute liver injury,ribavirin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, there appears to be no specific mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in the clinical studies conducted prior to 1986 or in the controlled trial from 1989-1990. Moreover, there is no mention of acute liver injury in the post-marketing surveillance data described within the adverse reactions section of the label.

The reported adverse reactions predominantly pertain to pulmonary and cardiovascular effects, hematologic outcomes like anemia and hemolytic anemia, and other reactions such as rash and conjunctivitis. Significant respiratory complications, including worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema, have been emphasized, with a specific warning provided regarding the use of aerosolized Ribavirin in mechanically ventilated patients.

Given the information from the drug label, we can state explicitly that there is no documented evidence within the provided excerpts to suggest that acute liver injury is a recognized or reported adverse reaction to Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP. It is important to note that adverse reactions not observed or reported in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance cannot be entirely ruled out. However, if acute liver injury were a common or well-recognized adverse event, it would likely have been mentioned in these sections of the drug label. Absence of mention in the provided sections generally indicates that evidence linking acute liver injury with Ribavirin exposure is either not established, not observed in the mentioned studies, or not reported in sufficient frequency to warrant inclusion as a recognized adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,ribociclib,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for ribociclib (brand name KISQALI), there is evidence supporting the association of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to the drug. This evidence stems from clinical trials, post-marketing experiences, and is acknowledged in the warnings and precautions associated with the drug's use.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the pooled safety data from the MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7, and MONALEESA-3 clinical trials, where 1065 patients received ribociclib, elevations in liver enzymes were reported as common adverse reactions, indicating potential hepatic injury. Specifically, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was seen in 52% of patients, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in 55%, and increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in 53%.

In more detailed results, Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (11%) and AST (8%) were observed in patients treated with ribociclib compared to those in the placebo arm (ALT 2.1%, AST 2%). Furthermore, a subset of patients experienced concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal, in the absence of cholestasis, indicating drug-related liver injury.

Post-marketing Experience:
The post-marketing experience (section 6.2 of the label) also includes reports of hepatobiliary toxicity, which is not quantified but communicated as a known adverse event based on voluntary reports from the post-approval use of ribociclib.

Warnings and Precautions:
The drug label's warnings and precautions (section 5.5) explicitly mention hepatobiliary toxicity as a concern and advise performing liver function tests (LFTs) before commencing treatment and monitoring at intervals during therapy. Additionally, recommendations are made for dose adjustments, interruptions, or discontinuations if liver enzyme elevations are detected.

In summary, the evidence linking ribociclib to potential acute liver injury includes reported incidences of liver enzyme elevations and hepatobiliary toxicity in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, leading to specific warnings and precautions on liver function monitoring and management of related adverse reactions in treated patients.",NA
acute liver injury,rifabutin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and rifabutin exposure can be summarized based on the information provided from clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and animal toxicology studies:

Clinical Trials:
In the text provided from clinical trials (studies 023 and 027), hepatitis is mentioned as an adverse event occurring in less than 1% of treated patients, suggesting that acute liver injury may occur, but infrequently. The trials also report increases in liver enzymes, such as SGOT and SGPT, which can indicate liver injury, in a higher percentage of patients taking rifabutin compared to placebo (SGOT: 7% vs. 12%; SGPT: 9% vs. 11%). However, these enzyme increases could be a sign of mild liver reactions and are not solely indicative of severe liver injury such as hepatitis.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
While the post-marketing experience mentions various reactions, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury or hepatitis as identified through post-marketing surveillance.

Animal Toxicology:
The animal toxicology data notes liver abnormalities (increased bilirubin and liver weight) in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses close to the recommended human daily dose when adjusted for body surface area. This suggests a potential for liver toxicity at certain doses, which may not directly translate to humans but warrants caution.

Overall, while there is a mention of hepatitis in clinical trials and evidence of liver abnormalities in animal studies, the provided sections do not include a strong or consistent signal that acute liver injury is a common adverse reaction to rifabutin in humans. It should be noted that acute liver injury is not listed among the adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of 1% or greater or in the post-marketing data. Nevertheless, health professionals should be aware of the potential for liver injury and monitor liver function when treating patients with rifabutin, especially at higher doses or in combination therapy.

Sources:
- Mention of hepatitis in the ""Clinical Adverse Events Reported in <1% of Patients Who Received Rifabutin"" section
- Increased SGOT and SGPT under ""Laboratory Abnormalities"" in clinical trials
- Liver abnormalities observed in animal toxicology studies",NA
acute liver injury,rifampin,1.0,"Based on the adverse reactions section of the rifampin drug label provided, there is evidence linking rifampin exposure to acute liver injury. The label indicates hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction associated with the use of rifampin, with manifestations that include transient abnormalities in liver function tests, hepatitis, a shock-like syndrome with hepatic involvement and abnormal liver function tests, and cholestasis. These hepatic adverse reactions are mentioned under the ""Hepatic"" subsection and are not uncommon, as indicated by the presence of these warnings on the label.

Clinical Studies: The drug label does not specify the details of clinical studies that observed these hepatic events. However, clinical studies would have been part of the initial safety assessment before the drug's approval, where liver function test abnormalities and other signs of liver injury may have been noted.

Post-Marketing Reports: The drug label states that adverse reactions are identified in post-marketing reports but also indicates that because these are reported voluntarily from an uncertain population size, the estimation of their frequency and establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure can be challenging.

Mechanism: The label does not detail the mechanism of rifampin-induced liver injury, but it is an acknowledged phenomenon that may occur with the use of rifampin, which necessitates monitoring for signs and symptoms of liver damage during treatment.

Warnings: The label includes warnings about the potential for severe liver damage, indicating that it is recognized as a serious risk associated with rifampin.

In summary, the drug label for rifampin itself serves as evidence for the association of acute liver injury with the use of the drug. The label notes hepatotoxicity, including hepatitis and abnormal liver function tests, as reported adverse reactions. Although specific details from clinical trials are not provided, the post-marketing experiences and the inclusion of these reactions in the label's warnings support the relationship between acute liver injury and rifampin exposure. Healthcare providers are advised to monitor liver function tests and watch for signs of liver injury in patients taking rifampin.",NA
acute liver injury,rifapentine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for rifapentine, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to support the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and rifapentine exposure.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
In clinical trials, hepatotoxicity, which can be indicative of acute liver injury, has been documented. Specifically, during a trial in HIV-negative patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, three patients discontinued treatment in the initial phase due to hepatotoxicity. All were also on isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine, and all recovered without sequelae. This demonstrates a temporal relationship between rifapentine exposure and the development of hepatotoxicity, indicating a potential adverse reaction.

Additionally, in the drug label section 5.1, there is a warning concerning hepatotoxicity that indicates elevations of liver transaminases may occur in patients receiving rifapentine. It advises monitoring for symptoms of liver injury and discontinuation of the drug if signs of liver injury develop.

Post-Marketing Evidence:
Post-marketing experiences have also identified hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction occurring following exposure to rifapentine, although the exact frequency of such occurrences is not specified due to the population size being unknown. Hepatotoxicity once again implies potential for acute liver injury.

Summary:
While the available information does not specifically label acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, there is evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance (noted in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the drug label) that hepatotoxicity, often a sign of liver injury, is an associated adverse reaction of rifapentine. This relationship is also highlighted in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.1), suggesting a need for caution and monitoring in patients receiving the drug. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that acute liver injury can be a potential adverse reaction to rifapentine based on the reported hepatotoxicity in these sources.",NA
acute liver injury,rilpivirine,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure to rilpivirine can be summarized from the following sources:

**Clinical Trials Experience**:
- During the safety assessment of rilpivirine, which was based on Week 96 pooled data from Phase 3 controlled trials (TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215), no specific mention of acute liver injury was made; however, there were increases in liver enzymes AST and ALT noted in some patients. Increased levels of AST and ALT can be indicative of hepatocellular injury.

**Postmarketing Experience**:
- Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine-containing regimen during postmarketing experience. Although the frequency is not reliably estimated, these reactions suggest a potential link between rilpivirine and hepatotoxicity, which may include acute liver injury.

**Warnings and Precautions**:
- The label explicitly notes hepatotoxicity as a risk under 'Warnings and Precautions' (section 5.2). It mentions that hepatic adverse events have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying liver disease or hepatitis B or C co-infection. A few cases of hepatotoxicity have also occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease, which increases the plausibility of a direct relationship between rilpivirine and liver injury.

The specific connection to ""acute liver injury"" as a term is not directly mentioned in the sections provided, although hepatotoxicity is discussed, which can encompass various forms of liver injury including acute liver injury.

To conclude, while there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury in the context of clinical trials, there is a noted risk of hepatotoxicity associated with rilpivirine both in clinical practice and post-marketing surveillance. This evidence supports a relationship between rilpivirine exposure and potential adverse liver reactions. Monitoring liver function in patients receiving rilpivirine is recommended in the label, especially in those with pre-existing liver conditions or concurrent hepatitis B or C infection.",NA
acute liver injury,rilpivirine,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is some evidence suggesting an association between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and the use of rilpivirine (EDURANT). Here are the relevant summaries from each of the sources mentioned:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - In the pooled Week 96 safety data from Phase 3 trials (TMC278-C209 and TMC278-C215) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients, increased liver enzymes (AST and ALT) were observed, suggesting hepatic events. Table 3 in the drug label shows the percentage of subjects with varying grades of increased liver enzymes, which could indicate hepatocellular damage or liver injury.

2. Hepatotoxicity Warnings:
   - In the Warnings and Precautions (5.2) section of the label, it is noted that hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients who received a rilpivirine-containing regimen, particularly those with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases at the start. There have also been a few cases of hepatic toxicity in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or identifiable risk factors.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
   - The postmarketing experience, as noted in section 6.2, indicates that adverse reactions related to the renal and genitourinary system have been reported. Although it does not explicitly mention acute liver injury, the section on hepatotoxicity implies that hepatic events have been observed after the drug went to market.

4. Subjects Co-infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus:
   - It is mentioned that patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus and receiving EDURANT had a higher incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation compared to those not co-infected. This is consistent with the information in the hepatotoxicity warnings about increased risk in patients with viral hepatitis.

5. Pediatric Patients:
   - No reported incidence of acute liver injury is explicitly stated for pediatric patients in the provided drug label sections. However, clinical evaluation recommends monitoring for hepatotoxicity.

In conclusion, clinical trial data showed increased liver enzymes indicating potential liver injury and hepatotoxicity warning signals this risk, especially in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions or co-infections with hepatitis B or C. Additionally, post-market surveillance reports renal and genitourinary adverse reactions, which could include hepatic events. No explicit mention of acute liver injury incidence is made for pediatric patients. Monitoring liver function is recommended by the drug label before and during treatment, particularly in populations at higher risk of hepatotoxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,risedronate,,"The provided drug label sections for risedronate do not include acute liver injury as a reported adverse reaction either in clinical trials or in post-marketing surveillance. The label reports commonly observed adverse reactions in clinical trials such as back pain, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia, and also reports rare cases of abnormal liver function tests (less than 0.1%), but it does not specify acute liver injury under either the clinical studies experience or the postmarketing experience. Additionally, the label provides detailed information on musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and ocular adverse events among others, but acute liver injury is not listed in these details.

Based on the provided label sections, there is no direct evidence to suggest that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction of risedronate. The rare reports of abnormal liver function tests are non-specific and do not necessarily indicate acute liver injury. Therefore, it can be stated explicitly that there is no known evidence from the provided label sections that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction to risedronate therapy. 

For accurate and up-to-date information on risedronate's adverse reactions including acute liver injury, one should consult the most recent prescription information, reports in medical literature, findings from clinical trials, and data from health authorities such as the FDA.",NA
acute liver injury,risperidone,,"The evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse effect of risperidone primarily comes from post-marketing surveillance data. The adverse reaction sections provided from the drug label discuss a wide range of potential side effects from clinical trials and observations, including metabolic changes, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, orthostatic hypotension, falls, and cerebrovascular adverse events, among others. However, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials data provided in these sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS and 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience).

The post-marketing experience (section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience) is where acute liver injury is mentioned alongside other adverse reactions such as alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, and angioedema. These are based on voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, making it difficult to determine the frequency or establish a strong causal relationship to drug exposure.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials data provided for risperidone, it has been identified as an adverse reaction in the post-marketing period. However, this relationship is based on voluntary reports and may not be well-characterized in terms of incidence or causality. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse reaction and monitor patients accordingly, especially those with pre-existing liver conditions or concurrent use of other hepatotoxic drugs.",NA
acute liver injury,ritonavir,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and ritonavir exposure can be drawn from various sources mentioned in the provided drug label sections, including clinical trial experience, post-marketing surveillance, and safety warnings.

1. Clinical Trials:
Clinical trials have demonstrated that ritonavir is associated with hepatotoxicity, which encompasses a spectrum of liver injuries, including acute liver injury. Adults in combined Phase II/IV studies (N=1,755) experienced hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatitis, which includes increased AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase), all of which are indicators of liver injury (Table 2). Additionally, marked laboratory abnormalities observed in trials include elevated AST and ALT levels, suggesting hepatocellular damage (Table 3).

2. Post-marketing Surveillance: 
Post-marketing reports have noted liver dysfunction, including fatal outcomes, in patients taking ritonavir. While the exact frequency cannot be determined due to the voluntary nature of these reports, the presence of these cases indicates that ritonavir exposure is associated with the risk of hepatic dysfunction, which can manifest as acute liver injury. However, it is worth noting that these cases often occurred in the context of patients taking multiple medications and/or having advanced AIDS, which may confound the direct relationship to ritonavir.

3. Warnings and Precautions: 
The drug label warns about the potential for hepatotoxicity, stating that fatalities have occurred. It is recommended to monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease or hepatitis B or C, or in the presence of elevated transaminases (Section 5.3). This underlines the recognized risk of ritonavir-related acute liver injury.

4. Box Warnings:
The box warnings section does not specifically mention acute liver injury; however, it emphasizes the potential for serious and life-threatening reactions due to drug interactions with ritonavir, which can affect hepatic metabolism.

Given this information, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences that support the relationship between acute liver injury and ritonavir exposure. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is advised for patients receiving ritonavir, and the presence of underlying liver conditions can increase the likelihood and severity of such adverse reactions.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute liver injury is indicated as a possible adverse reaction to ritonavir. Specifically, hepatotoxicity is addressed under Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and includes mentions of elevated liver transaminases, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice. The label further advises caution when administering ritonavir to patients with underlying liver diseases or enzyme abnormalities, and increased monitoring is recommended. Therefore, no evidence is available that refutes acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to ritonavir."
acute liver injury,rivaroxaban,,"The provided drug labeling information for rivaroxaban (XARELTO) primarily discusses risk factors and adverse reactions related to bleeding, as this is one of the most common and significant adverse reactions associated with anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban. The sections supplied (adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings) do not specifically mention acute liver injury as a recognized adverse reaction.

From the postmarketing experience section (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), under the Hepatobiliary disorders, there are mentions of jaundice, cholestasis, and hepatitis (including hepatocellular injury). These references suggest that there have been reports of liver-related adverse events associated with the use of rivaroxaban following its approval and widespread use. However, the language used (""have been identified during post-approval use"") implies that these findings are based on voluntary case reports and not systemic clinical studies. Voluntary reports can indicate a possible relationship but do not firmly establish a causal link due to potential underreporting, the presence of confounding factors, and lack of controlled conditions.

In summary, based on the provided drug labeling information for rivaroxaban, there is no explicit declaration that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction of rivaroxaban from clinical trials. However, postmarketing surveillance indicates some reports of hepatobiliary disorders, which may include acute liver injury. For a definitive assessment of the evidence linking rivaroxaban to acute liver injury, it would be necessary to review published case reports, clinical trial data, and further postmarketing surveillance studies that may have specifically investigated this potential adverse effect.
",NA
acute liver injury,rivaroxaban,,"The drug label for rivaroxaban (Xarelto) includes details on various adverse reactions and clinical trial experiences, but it does not specifically list acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction. The summary of clinical trials in the label discusses bleeding as the most common adverse reaction, for instance, bleeding complications, gastrointestinal bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage among others. Additionally, the postmarketing experience reports hepatic-related adverse reactions such as jaundice, cholestasis, and hepatitis (including hepatocellular injury), which suggest liver-related issues have been observed after market release.

While the label indicates instances of hepatobiliary disorders post-marketing, including hepatitis, it does not provide detailed evidence or the incidence rate of acute liver injury in relation to rivaroxaban exposure. A direct relationship with acute liver injury is not clearly established in the label's listed clinical trial data or the postmarketing surveillance section.

To establish a causal relationship between rivaroxaban and acute liver injury, we would need specific case studies, clinical trial data reporting this specific adverse event, or observational studies from post-marketing surveillance that confirm such a relationship. Since the label does not provide these specific details, it is important to consult the scientific literature for case reports and epidemiological studies that might provide further insight into the occurrence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to rivaroxaban.

In conclusion, the provided drug label for rivaroxapan (Xarelto) mentions hepatobiliary disorders including hepatitis in the postmarketing experience, which could involve acute liver injury. However, there is no explicit evidence in the given label indicating a clear relationship between acute liver injury and the use of rivaroxaban. For a definitive assessment, it would be necessary to review additional resources such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or a more detailed analysis of post-marketing surveillance data.",NA
acute liver injury,rivastigmine,,"The provided drug label sections for rivastigmine, which include adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, do not explicitly list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. However, under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section (6.2), there is mention of ""Hepatobiliary Disorders,"" specifying ""abnormal liver function tests"" and ""hepatitis.""

To summarize the evidence:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (6.1): There is no mention of acute liver injury in the detailed account of adverse reactions observed during the clinical trials of rivastigmine. The trials involved over 5,297 individuals worldwide, with various durations of exposure and at different dose levels. Most common adverse reactions observed were gastrointestinal in nature (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and not related to hepatobiliary function.

2. Postmarketing Experience (6.2): Although specific incidences of acute liver injury are not provided, it is stated that hepatobiliary disorders such as abnormal liver function tests and hepatitis have been reported during post-approval use of rivastigmine tartrate capsules. These reports are on a voluntary basis from an uncertain population size, making it difficult to establish a conclusive frequency or causal relationship.

3. Warnings and Precautions (5): No warnings or precautions specifically mention acute liver injury as a concern with rivastimine administration.

Based on the available information from the drug label, there is evidence to suggest that abnormal liver function and hepatitis, which could be indicative of potential acute liver injury, have been reported as postmarketing adverse reactions, although these occurrences seem to be uncommon and without detailed incidence rates. The causal relationship of rivastigmine with acute liver injury cannot be definitively established from the provided data due to a lack of detailed evidence and the spontaneous nature of the postmarketing reports.

Clinical trials have not reported acute liver injury as a common adverse effect, and it does not appear to be a significant concern when considering the most frequently observed adverse reactions. To fully assess the association between rivastigmine and acute liver injury, additional investigation such as targeted post-marketing surveillance studies or case report analyses would be necessary.",NA
acute liver injury,ropeginterferon alfa-2b,,"The relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to ropeginterferon alfa-2b is supported by several pieces of evidence outlined in the provided drug label sections:

1. Hepatotoxicity Warning:
   Section 5.11 of the provided label explicitly mentions hepatotoxicity as a potential adverse reaction to BESREMi (ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft). It indicates that hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving interferon alfa products, which includes BESREMi. There's a direct instruction to monitor liver enzymes and hepatic function at baseline and during treatment, and to adjust the dosage depending on the severity of liver enzyme elevations, suggesting a known risk of liver-related adverse reactions.

2. Clinical Trials Experience:
   Within the pooled safety population from two open-label trials (PEGINVERA, PROUD/CONTINUATION PV), liver enzyme elevations were reported as one of the most common adverse reactions, affecting 20% of patients. This suggests that a notable proportion of participants experienced liver-related adverse events.

3. Specific Adverse Reaction Incidence:
   The provided label details that in the clinical development program of BESREMi, 36 patients (20%) experienced liver enzyme elevations, with most having levels ranging from 1.25 to 5 times the upper limit of normal. It is noted that these patients were able to resume BESREMi upon the resolution of the liver enzyme elevations, which implies a causal relationship.

4. Box Warning and Precautionary Guidance:
   The box warning and precaution guidance also instruct healthcare providers on the management of hepatotoxicity. There's advice on dosing adjustments, weekly monitoring until enzyme levels return to baseline or improve, and potential discontinuation for persistent increased liver enzyme levels or evidence of hepatic decompensation, which underscores the importance of this potential adverse reaction.

5. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   While specific post-marketing surveillance data on acute liver injury are not provided in the text offered, the instructions for reporting suspected adverse reactions to PharmaEssentia or the FDA implies a mechanism for ongoing surveillance and collection of adverse event data after the drug has entered the market.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials that ropeginterferon alfa-2b can lead to liver enzyme elevations, which is a form of liver injury. This evidence is corroborated by the explicit warnings and precautions provided in the drug's labeling regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity, coupled with instructions for monitoring liver function and addressing potential adverse effects on the liver.",NA
acute liver injury,rosiglitazone,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, there is no direct evidence listed in the provided drug label sections that links rosiglitazone to acute liver injury. The sections of the label discuss various adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, but acute liver injury is not reported as a common adverse event in the clinical trial data presented.

In the section on serum transaminase levels, the label states that in pre-approval clinical studies of 4,598 patients treated with rosiglitazone and in a long-term 4- to 6-year study of 1,456 patients treated with the drug, there was no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Specifically, only 0.2% of patients treated with rosiglitazone had elevations in ALT (alanine aminotransferase) greater than three times the upper limit of normal compared to 0.2% on placebo and 0.5% on active comparators, and these elevations were reversible. Moreover, the label indicates that in pre-approval clinical trials, there were no cases of idiosyncratic drug reactions leading to hepatic failure.

However, in the post-marketing experience section, there are reports of hepatitis, hepatic enzyme elevations to three or more times the upper limit of normal, and hepatic failure with and without fatal outcomes in patients receiving rosiglitazone. Although these events have been reported, the drug label explicitly states that causality has not been established. This means that while there have been instances of liver-related adverse reactions in the post-marketing setting, there is no conclusive evidence that directly attributes these reactions to rosiglitazone usage.

In conclusion, the clinical trial information provided in the sections of the drug label does not indicate that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction to rosiglitazone. Post-marketing reports suggest a potential association with liver-related events, but causality has not been definitively established. Further investigation and post-marketing surveillance are necessary to determine if there is a causal relationship between rosiglitazone and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,rosuvastatin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for rosuvastatin, there is evidence to support a relationship between rosuvastatin exposure and the risk of acute liver injury. This evidence comes from both clinical trial data and post-marketing experience.

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:**
   - The labeling indicates there were observed increases in serum transaminases (markers of liver injury) in some patients during clinical trials, which appeared soon after initiation and were mostly transient. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, the increase in serum transaminases to more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 1.1% of patients taking rosuvastatin as opposed to 0.5% with placebo.

2. **Postmarketing Experience:**
   - There have been reports of hepatitis, jaundice, and both fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure identified during post-approval use of rosuvastatin. The incidence of these is not clearly stated due to the nature of voluntary reporting, but they are recognized as potential adverse reactions by the manufacturer and health professionals.

3. **Warnings and Precautions:**
   - The label warns of hepatic dysfunction and advises testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. It also specifically mentions that marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have been observed and that rosuvastatin should be discontinued if serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs.

Although these sources of evidence highlight a risk of liver injury associated with rosuvastatin, it's essential to note that such reactions are relatively rare, and causality can be difficult to establish definitively. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended as part of rosuvastatin therapy, especially in patients with risk factors for liver disease. 

To substantiate and fully understand the extent of the hepatic risks associated with rosuvastatin, one can refer to the data from clinical trials, the post-marketing experience mentioned in the drug label, and additional scientific literature. Clinical practice guidelines suggest that while statins are generally well-tolerated, they should be used with caution in patients with existing liver disease or heavy alcohol use, reinforcing the need for liver enzyme monitoring in certain populations.",NA
acute liver injury,sargramostim,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for sargramostim (LEUKINE), there is evidence to support a relationship between the drug and acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. This relationship is supported by clinical trial data.

From the Clinical Trials Experience section (6.1), under the subtitle ""Acute Myeloid Leukemia Following Induction Chemotherapy,"" liver toxicity is listed as an adverse reaction that occurred with an incidence of 77% in patients who received LEUKINE. This indicates that a substantial number of patients experienced liver toxicity, which includes acute liver injury, during treatment with sargramostim in the context of a clinical trial for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

The information extracted from clinical trials is a direct indication of the potential for acute liver injury when a patient is exposed to sargramostim. There is no explicit mentioning of case studies or post-marketing surveillance data within the reported labeling sections for the occurrence of acute liver injury specifically. However, postmarketing experiences (6.3) include a variety of adverse reactions, and while acute liver injury is not mentioned again here, it is worth noting that postmarketing surveillance often includes a broader array of less common adverse reactions that were not necessarily detected in clinical trials due to the controlled nature and smaller size of trial populations compared to the general patient population.

The evidence provided within the clinical trials and the lack of specific additional details from case studies and post-marketing surveillance, as mentioned in the drug label, suggest that the understanding of the relationship between acute liver injury and sargramostim primarily stems from clinical trial data, which showed a relatively high incidence of liver toxicity in patients treated for AML.

It is essential to consider the limitations of these data as they may not reflect the full scope of adverse reactions that could occur in clinical practice due to variables such as patient comorbidities, variable dosages, and concurrent medications. Additionally, this summary is limited to the data available up to my knowledge cutoff in early 2023 and the information provided in the sections of the drug label. New findings or additional sources beyond this timeframe could potentially provide further insights.",NA
acute liver injury,sarilumab,,"Based on the provided label information for sarilumab (KEVZARA), the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure can be summarized from clinical trials and observed laboratory abnormalities as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   In clinical studies, adverse reactions associated with sarilumab included elevated liver enzymes. These elevations were transient and without clinical evidence of hepatic impairment. The incidence of liver enzyme (ALT and AST) elevation was higher in patients treated with sarilumab + DMARDs compared to placebo + DMARDs. Specifically, for ALT, up to 43% of patients on 200 mg and 38% of patients on 150 mg of sarilumab + DMARDs experienced elevations greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) to 3 times ULN, compared to 25% on placebo. There were patients (up to 0.7% in the 200 mg and 1% in the 150 mg group) who experienced elevations greater than 5 times ULN.

2. Laboratory Abnormalities:
   - Decreased neutrophil count: Not associated with increased infections or serious infections in the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population.
   - Elevated liver enzymes: Patients who experienced liver enzyme elevation had their treatment regimen modified, such as interruption of sarilumab or dose reduction, resulted in decreased or normalized liver enzymes.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   No specific data from the post-marketing surveillance are included in the provided sections.

While acute liver injury is not explicitly described as a serious adverse reaction within the sections of the label provided, elevations in liver enzymes are noted as an adverse reaction and laboratory abnormality associated with sarilumab treatment. Serious liver injury would typically be accompanied by clinical symptoms and/or jaundice, which are not reported; hence, the available evidence refers to liver enzyme abnormalities rather than overt acute liver injury. 

Patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment are recommended not to be treated with sarilumab due to the association with transaminase elevations. Thus, while acute liver injury per se is not detailed, sarilumab has been associated with liver enzyme elevations which can be an indication of potential liver injury, particularly if the drug is not managed properly (e.g., by modifying or stopping treatment in case of significant liver enzyme elevations).

It's important to note that this summary is based on the limited sections of the drug label provided and may not encompass all available evidence. Additional detailed information from the full prescribing information, published studies, or pharmacovigilance databases could provide further insight regarding acute liver injury related to sarilumab.",NA
acute liver injury,satralizumab,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is evidence supporting the relationship between satralizumab exposure and acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. Specifically:

1. **Clinical Trials**: In two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials—Study 1 (without concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, IST) and Study 2 (with concurrent IST)—there was a notable incidence of elevated liver enzymes in patients treated with satralizumab compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

    - In Study 1, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 43% and 25% of patients treated with satralizumab, respectively, versus 13% and 9% in the placebo group.
    - In Study 2, elevated ALT or AST was observed in 8% of patients for both enzymes in the satralizumab group, compared to 12% and 19% in the placebo-treated patients.
    - Elevations of ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 3% of satralizumab-treated patients across both studies, with no equivalent occurrences in the placebo groups.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Although specific post-marketing surveillance data are not provided in the label text, the label advises healthcare professionals to monitor liver function tests (ALT and AST) periodically as indicated in the Warnings and Precautions (5.2). This suggests that there is a recognized risk of liver enzyme elevations, which can be indicative of liver injury.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**: The label specifically warns of elevated liver enzymes as a potential issue that requires monitoring during satralizumab treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. This further reinforces the established relationship between satralizumab use and liver injury.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and satralizumab is supported by clinical trial data that demonstrate a higher incidence of liver enzyme elevation in patients receiving satralizumab compared to placebo, indicating a potential for liver injury. Warnings and precautions on the label advise for monitoring of liver enzymes, recognizing the risk of acute liver injury as a possible adverse reaction to the drug.","Based on the information provided in the drug label for satralizumab, acute liver injury is mentioned as a potential concern under ""Elevated Liver Enzymes"" in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2). The label details the observation of mild and moderate elevations of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) in patients treated with satralizumab at a higher incidence than in those receiving placebo. It specifically notes that these elevations were not associated with increases in total bilirubin.

In the clinical trials referenced in the label, there were instances of ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurring in 3% of patients treated with satralizumab—compared to none in the placebo group. One patient on satralizumab experienced an elevation of ALT above 5 times the ULN, which normalized after discontinuation of the drug (6.1). Although these liver enzyme elevations are noted, no clear evidence of clinically diagnosed acute liver injury, characterized by severe liver damage or failure, is provided in the label.

The information does not explicitly refute the relationship between acute liver injury and satralizumab use; rather, it highlights the risk of elevated liver enzymes, which could be indicative of liver injury. It advises monitoring ALT and AST levels periodically during treatment with satralizumab (5.2).

In summary, while the provided label sections indicate a potential for liver enzyme elevations (which can suggest liver injury) during satralizumab treatment, there is no explicit evidence in the given sections to categorically refute a relationship between satralizumab exposure and acute liver injury. It is important to conduct a thorough review of all available clinical data, post-marketing surveillance, and published literature to fully assess the potential for acute liver injury with satralizumab. If additional studies or reports are available beyond the drug label, they would need to be consulted for a more comprehensive evaluation of the evidence."
acute liver injury,secnidazole,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for SOLOSEC (secnidazole), there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing experience specifically associated with secnidazole.

Adverse reactions that were reported during the clinical trials with an incidence of ≥2% among patients treated for bacterial vaginosis include vulvovaginal candidiasis, headache, nausea, dysgeusia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vulvovaginal pruritus. In the clinical trial for trichomoniasis, the most common adverse reaction was vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Post-marketing experience of secnidazole mentions various system disorders like dysgeusia, however, acute liver injury is not described. While there is mention of severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure associated with metronidazole, which is another nitroimidazole agent structurally related to secnidazole, this adverse reaction is specifically indicated for patients with Cockayne syndrome, and there is no indication that this is a side effect of secnidazole.

Given this information, it is appropriate to conclude that there is no known evidence from the provided drug label sections directly linking secnidazole with acute liver injury. However, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or the FDA to help further evaluate and monitor the safety profile of SOLOSEC. It is important to note that adverse reactions reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size post-marketing may not have a causal relationship established due to the nature of voluntary reporting.",NA
acute liver injury,secobarbital,,"The provided drug label sections for secobarbital mention liver damage under ""Other Reported Reactions"" as an adverse reaction, although it does not specify the frequency or provide detailed data. This is an indication that there may have been reports of acute liver injury related to secobarbital use, which is consistent with what is known about barbiturates in general. 

While the label does not provide specific evidence, such as results from clinical trials or case studies confirming the direct incidence of acute liver injury caused by secobarbital, including it in the list of adverse reactions suggests that there have been post-marketing reports or other forms of surveillance data that have recorded instances of liver damage associated with the drug. 

In the medical literature, barbiturates are known to potentially cause liver damage, which can range from mild transient elevations in liver enzymes to severe hepatic injury. Acute liver injury is a serious condition that can lead to liver failure and death if not recognized and managed promptly. 

The precise mechanism by which secobarbial might cause liver damage is not fully understood, but it could involve direct toxicity, idiosyncratic reactions, or immune-mediated mechanisms. However, given the available information, a definitive conclusion about the frequency, characteristics, and mechanisms of secobarbital-induced liver injury cannot be drawn without further details.

Thus, while the mention of liver damage on the drug label indicates some level of concern or occurrence, the evidence supporting a causal relationship is not detailed in this excerpt. Clinicians should remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of liver injury in patients taking secobarbital, given that it is listed as a potential adverse reaction, and detailed evidence may exist beyond the label information provided.","The relevant sections of the drug label provided do not contain any direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and secobarbital use. However, ""liver damage"" is noted under the ""Other Reported Reactions"" section, which suggests that liver injury has been recognized as a potential adverse reaction, albeit potentially rare or under certain conditions, associated with the drug.

Without additional specific evidence that clearly refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and secobarbital, which could include large-scale studies or a systematic review of cases demonstrating no increased risk of liver injury, we cannot conclusively state that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction. Therefore, in this context, 'NA' does not apply as there is an acknowledgement of liver damage as an adverse reaction in the drug's labeling information.

For a conclusive refutation, we would need to refer to controlled clinical trials, epidemiological studies, or large-scale meta-analyses specifically investigating the incidence of acute liver injury in patients taking secobarbital compared to a control group that did not take the drug. If such studies do exist and have found no increased incidence of acute liver injury with secobarbital use when compared to controls or expected baselines, that would constitute evidence refuting the relationship. However, such specific evidence is not provided in the text you have furnished."
acute liver injury,selpercatinib,,"**Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury and Selpercatinib Exposure:**

**Clinical Trials:**
Selpercatinib (sold under the brand name RETEVMO) has been evaluated in clinical trials, notably LIBRETTO-001, and findings regarding hepatotoxicity have been reported. The drug label indicates serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients treated with RETEVMO. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 56% of patients and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in 59%, including Grade 3 or 4 events in 12% for elevated ALT and 11% for elevated AST. Median times to the first onset of increased AST and ALT were approximately 6 and 5.8 weeks respectively, after starting RETEVMO. RETEVMO's labeling recommends monitoring liver enzymes initially, biweekly for 3 months, then monthly and as clinically needed. Dose adjustments, including withholding or discontinuing RETEVMO, may be necessary based on the severity of liver enzyme elevations.

**Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The drug label does not provide specific post-marketing surveillance data on acute liver injury. However, because the label advises on the possibility of hepatotoxicity and provides guidance on monitoring liver enzymes, it can be inferred that liver injury is a recognized risk associated with selpercatinib's use.

**Conclusion:**
Based on evidence from clinical trial data included in the drug label, there is a clear association between selpercatinib exposure and the potential risk of acute liver injury. This relationship is substantiated by the reported incidences of increased liver enzymes, corresponding serious hepatic adverse reactions, and the inclusion of hepatotoxicity in both the Warnings and Precautions and Adverse Reactions sections of the label. Due to the potential for hepatotoxicity, the label emphasizes the need for monitoring liver enzymes and managing dosing in response to liver enzyme elevations.

**Sources:**
The information provided comes directly from the drug label (RETEVMO) for selpercatinib, which includes details from the LIBRETTO-001 clinical trial and recommendations for monitoring and management of adverse reactions, including hepatotoxicity. The label represents the official documentation of drug-related information that has been reviewed and approved by regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",NA
acute liver injury,sertraline,,"The provided drug label information includes a section on hepatobiliary disorders, where it mentions that post-marketing experience for sertraline hydrochloride (the active ingredient in Zoloft) has identified adverse reactions such as ""severe liver events (including hepatitis, jaundice, liver failure with some fatal outcomes), pancreatitis"" among patients taking the medication. This information implies that there have been reports of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to sertraline, although the frequency cannot be reliably estimated because these reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size.

It is essential to acknowledge that in the realm of drug safety, post-marketing surveillance data, although valuable for detecting rare adverse events, can be less definitive in establishing causality compared to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Causality assessment often requires careful consideration of temporal association, exclusion of alternative causes, dechallenge/rechallenge information, and biological plausibility.

In the absence of specific clinical trial data relating to acute liver injury as an adverse effect of sertraline, the reported post-marketing cases, even if rare, serve as evidence that such a relationship may exist. The discovery of such events post-marketing highlights the importance of pharmacovigilance and the need for healthcare providers to monitor for signs of hepatic dysfunction and to report any suspect adverse reactions to appropriate drug safety surveillance systems, such as the FDA's MedWatch.

Prescribers should be cognizant of this potential adverse effect and assess liver function as appropriate, particularly in patients who present with symptoms indicative of liver injury or those who have pre-existing liver conditions.

To summarize, evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and sertraline exposure comes from post-marketing case reports. This information suggests that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction to the drug, although such occurrences may be rare. Without detailed case studies, clinical trial data, or a large cohort study providing more comprehensive evidence, we cannot conclusively establish the incidence or the full clinical spectrum of sertraline-induced liver injury.","NA

There is no presented evidence within the provided drug label sections that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and sertraline exposure. Additionally, the label does mention ""Hepatobiliary disorders - severe liver events (including hepatitis, jaundice, liver failure with some fatal outcomes), pancreatitis"" in the post-marketing experience section, which indicates that there have been reports of liver injury related to sertraline post-approval."
acute liver injury,sevoflurane,,"**Summary of Evidence for Sevoflurane and Acute Liver Injury:**

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
Within the clinical trial data provided for sevoflurane, there is mention of metabolic and nutrition-related adverse events that include increases in liver function tests such as LDH, AST, and ALT. Elevated liver enzymes such as AST and ALT are commonly used indicators of liver injury, which suggests the possibility of hepatic impairment or injury associated with the drug. However, specific instances of acute liver injury are not detailed in the clinical trial sections provided.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
Post-marketing experiences have reported cases of mild, moderate, and severe post-operative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice following the use of sevoflurane. Although histological evidence was not provided for these reported cases, they suggest an association between sevoflurane exposure and subsequent liver injury. It should be noted that many of these cases occurred in patients with underlying hepatic conditions or concurrent use of other drugs known to cause hepatic dysfunction, and most events were transient and resolved spontaneously.

The drug label also includes reports of hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure post-approval, indicating severe liver damage; however, the causal relationship to sevoflurane is not definitively established given the spontaneous nature of these reports.

**Conclusion:**
The relationship between sevoflurane and acute liver injury is suggested by the elevation of liver enzymes observed in clinical trials and by post-marketing reports of hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure. However, the evidence does not conclusively establish the cause-and-effect relationship due to confounding factors such as underlying liver conditions and concurrent medications known to affect liver function. The evidence does warrant caution and consideration of liver function monitoring in patients receiving sevoflurane.",NA
acute liver injury,sildenafil,,"The provided drug label information does not explicitly mention acute liver injury as a documented adverse reaction to sildenafil. Sildenafil citrate, known by its brand name Viagra among others, is primarily indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

According to the label, the most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials (≥ 2%) included headache, flushing, dyspepsia, abnormal vision, nasal congestion, back pain, myalgia, nausea, dizziness, and rash. It is important to note that clinical trial experience may not cover all possible adverse reactions, as rare side effects may not become apparent until a drug is used by a wider population post-approval.

In the section detailing the ""Digestive"" system adverse reactions, there is mention of abnormal liver function tests; however, this does not specify acute liver injury, which is a more severe condition. Acute liver injury can present as a sudden loss of liver function in someone without any pre-existing liver disease.

In postmarketing experience, where adverse reactions are identified based on voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, a wide variety of events have been documented without mentioning acute liver injury specifically related to sildenafil citrate. Given the limitations of voluntary reporting, such as underreporting and lack of confirmatory evidence, it is challenging to establish a direct causal relationship between drug exposure and specific adverse events, including liver injury, without additional clinical data.

For the claim of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to sildenafil, further investigation may be needed. This would involve comprehensive review and analysis of literature such as case reports, case series, pharmacovigilance databases, and potentially a reevaluation of clinical trial data where liver-related parameters were measured. If such data are available and suggest a link to sildenafil, the label could be updated accordingly by regulatory authorities like the FDA.

As of the information provided from the label, there is no direct evidence indicating that acute liver injury is a recognized adverse reaction of sildenafil. Clinicians and patients should report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate channels, such as Torrent Pharma Inc. or FDA MedWatch, to contribute to the post-marketing surveillance of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute liver injury,simvastatin,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and simvastatin exposure derives from various sources including clinical trial data, post-marketing experience, and the mechanisms of hepatic side effects associated with statins in general.

Clinical Trials Experience:
Clinical studies that included simvastatin have reported liver enzyme elevations. For example, persistent increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the upper limit of normal (3xULN) occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving simvastatin. The drug label mentions that moderate (less than 3xULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported with use. Moreover, marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have been observed. In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (Study 4S), transaminase elevations greater than 3xULN were reported in 0.7% of patients taking simvastatin versus 0.6% in those taking placebo.

Postmarketing Experience:
Postmarketing surveillance provides additional insights into adverse reactions that may not have been fully captured in clinical trials due to their rarity or late emergence. The drug label highlights rare postmarketing reports of both fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. These are instances of acute liver injury that have been reported voluntarily and are of uncertain frequency.

Mechanisms Related to Statins:
While the drug label does not explicitly link acute liver injury solely to simvastatin, it is well established in medical literature that statins can lead to hepatotoxic effects, ranging from asymptomatic increases in liver enzymes to rare cases of severe liver injury.

There is evidence, as documented in the drug label, to suggest that simvastatin can be associated with liver enzyme elevations, which may be a surrogate marker for liver injury in certain cases. However, acute liver injury, as a serious adverse reaction, is much less frequent, with only rare post-marketing reports linking it to simvastatin. The evidence does not allow for a clear estimation of frequency or a strong causal relationship, partly due to underreporting or other confounding factors in post-marketing surveillance.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggests that there is a potential relationship between simvastatin exposure and acute liver injury, although such occurrences appear to be rare. Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended before and during treatment with simvastatin as a precaution.",NA
acute liver injury,siponimod,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and siponimod (marketed as Mayzent) includes information from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. In the clinical trials section (6.1) of the drug label, transaminase increases were listed as one of the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with Mayzent, occurring at an incidence greater than 10%. Furthermore, liver injury is described in detail in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.6) of the label.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
From the clinical trials experience, specifically in Study 1, an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations was observed in Mayzent-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo. Elevations in transaminases occurred in 10.1% of Mayzent-treated patients versus 3.7% of those receiving placebo. These transaminase elevations, which include alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were predominantly noted within the first six months of initiating treatment. Significant elevations, defined as ALT or AST increases to three and five times the upper limit of normal (ULN), were reported in 5.6% and 1.4% of Mayzent-treated patients, respectively. Notably, liver enzyme levels typically normalized approximately one month after discontinuation of the drug.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
The post-marketing experience (6.2) section indicates that because these data are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. However, the inclusion of liver injury in the post-marketing section of the label suggests that cases of liver injury have been reported after siponimod's approval and commercial availability.

In summary, clinical trial data suggest an association between siponimod and liver injury, characterized by elevations in liver enzymes. This association is further supported by post-marketing surveillance, though precise incidence rates are difficult to ascertain from spontaneous reports. Given this evidence, liver enzyme monitoring is recommended before and during treatment with siponimod, especially within the first six months, and prompt discontinuation of the medication should be considered if significant liver injury is confirmed.",NA
acute liver injury,sirolimus,,"The provided drug label information for sirolimus details several adverse reactions documented through clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. Specific mention of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to sirolimus is not made in the sections provided. However, there are reports under section 6.7 of the Postmarketing Experience that indicate hepatotoxicity and fatal hepatic necrosis in patients treated with sirolimus have been observed, although these reports are accompanied by a note that elevated sirolimus trough concentrations were present, suggesting a possible dose-dependent relationship.

Moreover, in section 5.8 ('Decline in Renal Function'), there is a statement addressing abnormal liver function tests following the withdrawal of cyclosporine in a clinical trial (Study 3), which indicates liver-related adverse events may be associated with sirolimus therapy in certain contexts.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction, there are indications from post-marketing reports and clinical trial experiences (such as abnormal liver function tests) that suggest a possible relationship between sirolimus exposure and liver-related adverse reactions. Still, concrete evidence linking sirolimus directly to acute liver injury as a frequent adverse reaction is not robustly documented in the provided sections of the drug label. Clinicians should monitor liver function as part of the overall safety management in patients receiving sirolimus, considering the post-marketing observations of hepatotoxicity, especially at high sirolimus concentrations.",NA
acute liver injury,solifenacin,,"Based on the information provided, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to solifenacin does not appear to be a commonly reported or recognized adverse event in the context of the clinical trial data presented or in the listed adverse reactions from post-marketing experience. However, the drug label does include information on hepatobiliary disorders characterized by abnormal liver function tests (e.g., AST, ALT, GGT) identified during post-approval use of solifenacin succinate (Section 6.2). While not explicitly mentioning ""acute liver injury,"" abnormalities in liver function tests could suggest possible liver injury or dysfunction.

Adverse reactions listed in the drug label from the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1) include a variety of gastrointestinal issues, neurological and psychological disturbances, urinary tract infections, and vision issues, among others, but do not specifically list acute liver injury. The most common adverse reactions were dry mouth and constipation at 5 mg and 10 mg doses, with urinary tract infection and blurred vision additionally noted at the 10 mg dose. There is no explicit mention of liver-related adverse effects in the context of the clinical trials.

In Section 6.2, which details post-marketing experience, ""liver disorders mostly characterized by abnormal liver function tests"" are mentioned. This suggests that there have been reports of liver-related adverse events during the broader use of the drug since its approval, but this information is based on voluntary reports from an uncertain population size. It also does not establish a causal relationship to drug exposure with certainty due to the nature of post-marketing surveillance, where other factors can also contribute to such findings.

In summary, while acute liver injury is not highlighted as a commonly observed adverse reaction in clinical trials or specifically listed in the post-marketing experience section, abnormal liver function test results have been reported post-marketing. This finding indicates that there may be a potential for liver-related adverse effects, which could include acute liver injury, but the evidence does not provide conclusive information to establish a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between solifenacin exposure and acute liver injury. Additional research, including targeted post-marketing surveillance and studies, would be required to better understand this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,sorafenib,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is evidence supporting a relationship between acute liver injury and sorafenib exposure. The specific evidence can be identified in section ""5.10 Drug-Induced Liver Injury"" of the drug label. Here, it is mentioned that:

- Sorafenib-induced hepatitis, characterized by hepatocellular damage and significant transaminase increases, can lead to hepatic failure and death. The label indicates a severe drug-induced liver injury incidence rate of approximately 0.06% within a global monotherapy database consisting of 3,357 patients.
- The label advises monitoring liver function tests regularly, and in cases where there is a significant rise in transaminases without an alternative explanation, the recommendation is to discontinue sorafenib.
- Additionally, in the Clinical Trials Experience (section 6.1), it is noted that liver dysfunction was reported in 11% of patients treated with sorafenib and 2% of those cases were of at least Grade 3 severity.
- Laboratory test abnormalities (Table 5) in the SHARP (HCC) study show hypoalbuminemia and elevated INR, both of which could indicate impaired liver function.
- Furthermore, laboratory abnormalities reported (Table 9) from the DECISION (DTC) trial show elevated ALT and AST, which are markers for liver injury, in a significant portion of patients treated with sorafenib.

In summary, clinical trial data and post-marketing experience provided in the drug label demonstrate a definitive association between sorafenib use and the risk of drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver injury. Clinicians are instructed to monitor liver function tests regularly in patients taking sorafenib and consider discontinuation of the drug if significant liver enzyme elevations are observed without alternative explanation.",NA
acute liver injury,soybean oil,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to soybean oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions, like Intralipid, can be derived from the provided drug label sections, including clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
- Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease (PNALD), which includes various liver dysfunctions, has been reported as a consequence of long-term parenteral nutrition and potentially linked to components in soybean oil lipid emulsions.
- In clinical trials, a higher incidence of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis (PNAC), a precursor to PNALD, was observed in neonates and infants treated with Intralipid compared to those treated with a mixed lipid emulsion. For instance, PNAC occurred in 11.5% of Intralipid-treated patients versus 2.4% in patients receiving a 4-oil mixed lipid emulsion in a study with neonates and infants expected to be on Parenteral Nutrition (PN) for at least 28 days.

2. Post-marketing Experience:
- Voluntary reports post-marketing have included cases of hepatobiliary disorders, but specific frequencies and a clear causal relationship to Intralipid are difficult to ascertain due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
- Section 5.2 of the label explicitly addresses the Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease (PNALD), which can manifest as steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure. It suggests monitoring liver function and considering discontinuation or dosage reduction of Intralipid if abnormalities occur.

The above findings are specific to soybean oil emulsions such as Intralipid, with the summary of evidence implying a potential association between soybean oil-based lipid emulsions and liver injury, particularly in neonates and infants receiving such treatments for extended periods. Direct references to acute liver injury, specifically in adults and not linked to the context of PNALD, are however not clearly outlined within the supplied sections of the drug label. It is also important to note that these adverse effects are not solely attributed to soybean oil but are associated with long-term parenteral nutrition as well.

The evidence is sourced from the provided drug label sections, which contain aggregated data from Intralipid's clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, presented in the adverse reaction, warnings, and post-marketing experience subsections.",NA
acute liver injury,sparsentan,,"Based on the given drug label information, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and the use of the drug sparsentan, which is marketed under the brand name FILSPARI.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
The safety of FILSPARI was evaluated in the PROTECT clinical study (NCT03762850), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in adults with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). In this study, elevations in liver enzymes (aminotransferases ALT or AST) of at least 3-times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in up to 2.5% of patients treated with FILSPARI. These liver enzyme elevations are a potential indicator of liver injury, which can range from mild to severe hepatotoxicity.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The drug label advises healthcare professionals to report suspected adverse reactions to Travere Therapeutics or the FDA. This indicates ongoing post-marketing surveillance to capture adverse events that may not have been evident in clinical trials.

**Boxed Warnings:**
FILSPARI has a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity, indicating that this is a serious risk identified with the drug's use. The label emphasizes that some endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), which include sparsentan, have been associated with elevated aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure.

**Monitoring Recommendations:**
The label advises healthcare providers to measure liver enzymes and bilirubin levels before initiating treatment with FILSPARI and then conduct regular monitoring (monthly for the first 12 months, followed by every 3 months). Treatment should be interrupted if aminotransferase elevations more than 3x ULN are detected, underscoring the importance of monitoring for hepatotoxicity.

**Rechallenge Evidence:**
The mention of cases confirmed with rechallenge suggests that upon re-administration of the drug, the liver enzyme elevations recurred in some patients, further supporting a causative relationship between drug exposure and hepatic injury.

**Special Considerations:**
The label advises against the initiation of FILSPARI in patients with pre-existing elevated aminotransferases (>3x ULN) as these patients may be at increased risk for serious hepatotoxicity and may be more difficult to monitor for liver injury.

**Conclusions:**
In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and drug labeling that supports the association between acute liver injury and sparsentan (FILSPARI) use. The evidence includes observed elevations in liver enzymes in the PROTECT study, the presence of a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity, and monitoring recommendations that emphasize the importance of vigilance for liver injury in patients being treated with this medication. 

**Sources:**
The sources of evidence are the given drug label sections relating to adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, as well as the clinical trial identifier (NCT03762850) for the PROTECT study.",NA
acute liver injury,stavudine,1.0,"The drug label for stavudine provides evidence of a possible relationship between stavudine exposure and acute liver injury. This evidence comes from multiple sections within the label, including the stated adverse reactions, clinical trial experience, postmarketing experience, and specific warnings and precautions. The evidence can be classified into the following categories:

1. Clinical Trial Experience:
Data from clinical trials suggest that hepatic adverse reactions can occur. In controlled monotherapy and combination therapy studies (Study AI455-019, START 1, and START 2), laboratory abnormalities related to liver function were reported. This includes elevated levels of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and other hepatic enzymes (Tables 2, 4, 5, and 6).

2. Postmarketing Experience:
Postmarketing reports, which come from voluntary submissions, have identified symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, and liver failure among the adverse reactions to stavudine (Section 6.2). It is important to note that these reports are less controlled and may not establish a direct causal relationship to drug exposure. However, they provide real-world insight into adverse events occurring outside of clinical trials.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
- The boxed warning emphasizes that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been associated with stavudine use.
- There is a specific contraindication against coadministration of stavudine with didanosine due to increased risk of serious and life-threatening events, including hepatic toxicity.
- Hepatic toxicity warning (Section 5.2) indicates that stavudine use may be associated with severe, potentially fatal liver toxicity and advises considering interruption or discontinuation in patients showing signs of liver dysfunction.

4. Use in Specific Populations:
- Regarding pregnant individuals, the warning mentions fatal lactic acidosis in the context of using stavudine in combination with didanosine and other antiretrovirals.
- The label advises caution when administering stavudine to patients with known risk factors for liver disease.

This summarized evidence from clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance, and specific label warnings indicates that there is a relationship between stavudine exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, including severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and lactic acidosis. Healthcare providers should carefully monitor liver function in patients taking stavudide and consider alternative treatments where appropriate.","Based on the provided drug label sections for stavudine, acute liver injury is indeed recognized as an adverse reaction to the drug. The adverse reactions sections and warnings explicitly mention hepatic toxicity (5.2) and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (5.1) as potential adverse reactions related to stavudine use, which can include symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, the label warns of potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, especially when used in combination with other medications such as didanosine or in the context of preexisting liver dysfunction.

It is specifically stated that coadministration with didanosine is contraindicated due to the increased risk of serious and potentially life-threatening events, further underscoring the drug's association with liver-related adverse effects.

To summarize, the evidence provided in the drug label for stavudine supports the relationship between drug exposure and potential acute liver injury. Refutation of this relationship is not supported by the label information provided, as adverse hepatic reactions are clearly listed as potential and serious complications of stavudine use. Therefore, the request for evidence refuting the relationship is not applicable (NA), as the adverse reaction is indeed related to the drug according to the label information."
acute liver injury,sufentanil,,"Based on the information provided from the labeling of Sufentanil Citrate Injection, there is no explicit mentioning of acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction either from clinical trial experiences (Section 6.1) or postmarketing experience (Section 6.2). The most common adverse reactions reported were apnea, rigidity, and bradycardia.

In the clinical trials section, adverse reactions related to the epidural use of sufentanil in labor and delivery were assessed in 340 patients across two studies. However, specific mention of acute liver injury was not found.

Postmarketing surveillance has identified other adverse reactions, such as serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, anaphylaxis, androgen deficiency, opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and hypoglycemia. Still, acute liver injury is not listed among these observed adverse events.

Furthermore, the warnings and precautions section (Section 5) offers extensive detail on various risks associated with the use of sufentanil, including issues related to respiratory depression, interaction with certain drugs, muscle rigidity, cardiovascular effects, and potential neurologic impacts, among others. Despite this comprehensive detailing of potential side effects, acute liver injury is not discussed as a risk of sufentanil administration.

Without additional information or published reports, it can be concluded that there is no known evidence in the provided sections of the drug label that supports a direct relationship between sufentanil and acute liver injury. For the most accurate assessment, one would typically consider a review of the latest research literature, reports to adverse drug reaction monitoring programs, and other sources of pharmacovigilance data which were not provided here. If concerned about this potential adverse reaction, further investigation into more comprehensive databases, scientific studies, or case report literature may be warranted.",NA
acute liver injury,sulfasalazine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and sulfasalazine exposure can be found within the provided drug label sections concerning adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing surveillance. 

Clinical Trials and Adverse Reactions Section:
Sulfasalazine's adverse reactions include various hepatobiliary disorders. Specifically, the label lists hepatitis and hepatic necrosis with or without immune complexes and fulminant hepatitis, which sometimes leads to liver transplantation, under the hypersensitivity reactions section. While the label does not explicitly mention ""acute liver injury"", hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatitis are serious liver injuries and could be classified as such.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing reports provide further evidence as they include voluntary reports from clinical practice after the drug has been approved. These reports mention hepatotoxicity, characterized by elevated liver function tests (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, cirrhosis, hepatitis cholestatic, cholestasis, and potential hepatocellular damage including liver necrosis and liver failure. Some of these cases were fatal, suggesting a more severe level of liver injury which could certainly encompass acute liver injury.

It is essential to note that in the post-marketing reports, the causality is not always clearly established due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the lack of detailed information that typically accompanies controlled clinical trials.

Overall, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to support that acute liver injury can be an adverse reaction to sulfasalazine. This is indicated by the listing of various severe liver-related adverse effects, including hepatitis and hepatic necrosis, and post-marketing reports of hepatotoxicity with severe outcomes. However, the exact frequency of these adverse reactions and a detailed causation link would require a thorough review of the clinical data and additional studies.",NA
acute liver injury,sulindac,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of sulindac can be summarized from both the clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance as presented in the drug label sections provided:

1. Clinical Trial Data:
   - The adverse reactions section indicates that liver function abnormalities have been observed in clinical trials involving 1,865 patients, where 232 were observed for at least 48 weeks.
   - Reported liver-related adverse reactions in these clinical trials include jaundice (occasionally with fever), cholestasis, hepatitis, and hepatic failure, although the frequency appears to be less than 1% as it is listed under the ""Incidence Less Than 1 in 100"" category.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   - Post-marketing reports have also provided evidence of acute liver injury related to sulindac exposure, with rare reports of sulindac metabolites found in biliary ""sludge"" and biliary calculi in patients with cholecystitis symptoms undergoing cholecystectomy.
   - There is a mention of hepatic failure in the sections discussing hypersensitivity reactions. This falls under the potentially fatal syndrome that includes liver function changes, indicating that acute liver injury has been reported as part of post-marketing surveillance, although the incidence is not specified.

3. Warnings and Boxed Warnings:
   - There is no direct mention of acute liver injury in the warnings or box warnings sections provided. These sections focus on the risks of cardiovascular thrombotic events and gastrointestinal risks, which are more common and serious concerns related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including sulindac.

It is important to note that while liver-related adverse effects have been reported, the exact frequency and probability of acute liver injury due to sulindac are not detailed, implying that such events are infrequent but recognized. Monitoring of liver function is likely to be advisable when patients are on sulindac, especially for those who may be at increased risk of developing liver injury.

In conclusion, there is evidence of a relationship between acute liver injury and sulindac use, based on clinical trial observations and post-marketing reports, as identified in the drug label sections for adverse reactions. However, the reported incidence is low, suggesting that while the risk exists, it is not common. Clinical vigilance is needed to recognize and manage such adverse reactions if they occur.","NA

The provided drug label sections include a list of adverse reactions associated with sulindac, among which liver function abnormalities are mentioned, indicating that hepatic issues, including acute liver injury, have been observed. Therefore, evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and sulindac exposure is not applicable, as acute liver injury is recognized as a potential adverse reaction of the drug."
acute liver injury,sumatriptan,,"Based on the detailed drug label sections provided, acute liver injury is not listed as a recognized adverse reaction of sumatriptan in the clinical trial experience (section 6.1) or in the post-marketing experience (section 6.2). 

The more commonly reported adverse reactions from the clinical trials (section 6.1) include atypical sensations (paresthesia, sensations of warmth/cold), pain and pressure sensations (including chest pain/tightness/pressure/heaviness and neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure), vertigo, and malaise/fatigue. In the post-marketing experience (section 6.2), reactions such as cardiovascular (hypotension, palpitations) and neurological issues (dystonia, tremor) have been identified.

Additionally, while various cardiovascular and other systemic reactions to sumatriptan are highlighted in the warnings and precautions section, no mention of liver injury or hepatotoxicity is given. It's important to note that this absence is specific to the drug label provided and not an exhaustive review of all available literature on sumatriptan.

Therefore, according to the information contained within these sections of the sumatriptan drug label, there is no known evidence of acute liver injury being an adverse reaction to sumatriptan. For a definitive conclusion, a literature search outside of the label would be recommended to check for any case studies or reports that might have been published regarding liver injury associated with sumatriptan use.",NA
acute liver injury,sunitinib,,"Evidence for the relationship between acute liver injury and sunitinib exposure is clearly outlined in the provided drug label, where hepatotoxicity is listed as a potential severe adverse reaction. The evidence presented can be summarized from the following sources:

1. **Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions**: The label includes a boxed warning highlighting the risk of severe hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal. It is recommended that liver function tests such as ALT, AST, and bilirubin are monitored at baseline, during each cycle, and as clinically indicated. The drug should be interrupted or the dose reduced in the event of Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, with permanent discontinuation recommended for Grade 4 hepatotoxicity or patients showing signs and symptoms of liver failure.

2. **Clinical Trials Experience**: In the pooled safety population from clinical trials, liver failure, which includes symptoms like jaundice, elevated transaminases and/or hyperbilirubinemia in conjunction with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and/or renal failure, occurred in less than 1% of patients. Specific trials are not detailed in the provided text for cases of acute liver injury, but the overall safety populations described suggest that the adverse reaction was observed during clinical testing.

3. **Postmarketing Experience**: Postmarketing reports, which include voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and consumers, have identified hepatobiliary disorders such as liver failure among the adverse reactions. Although the frequency of these reports is uncertain, postmarketing surveillance contributes to the understanding of the drug's safety profile in a real-world setting.

In summary, evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and sunitinib comes from safety warnings, clinical trial experiences where hepatotoxicity has been observed even leading to fatalities, and postmarketing surveillance that has captured incidences of liver injury. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver functions closely in patients receiving sunitinib and manage the drug's dosage accordingly or discontinue its use based on the severity of hepatotoxicity observed.",NA
acute liver injury,tadalafil,,"Based on the provided labeling information, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to tadalafil. The adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings from the label focus on other potential risks and side effects associated with tadalafil, such as hypotension, visual and hearing loss, priapism, and the most commonly reported adverse reaction, which is headache.

The sections provided on clinical trial experience (6.1) and postmarketing experience (6.2) do not list acute liver injury as an observed side effect. The clinical trials mentioned were primarily related to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and highlighted adverse events that occurred at a greater frequency in the treatment group compared to placebo. These adverse events included headache, myalgia, nasopharyngitis, flushing, respiratory tract infection, pain in extremity, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion.

The postmarketing experience section (6.2) lists cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, hypersensitivity reactions, nervous system disorders, ophthalmologic issues, and otologic events, among others, as adverse reactions identified after approval of the drug, not specifically mentioning liver injury.

Therefore, based on the provided sections of the drug labeling for tadalafil, there is no known evidence to suggest that acute liver injury is related to tadalafil exposure. If acute liver injury has been observed in context with tadalafil use, it may not have been documented in the sections provided or reached a frequency or causation level required for inclusion. For a comprehensive assessment, a search of the medical literature and databases, such as PubMed or clinical trial registries, would be advisable to determine if there have been any case reports, observational studies, or other sources of evidence linking acute liver injury to tadalafil use after the knowledge cutoff date.",NA
acute liver injury,tagraxofusp,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and tagraxofusp (ELZONRIS) primarily comes from clinical trials and includes reports of hepatotoxicity, as detailed in the drug label sections provided.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The safety of ELZONRIS was assessed in a single-arm clinical trial with 122 adults having newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory myeloid malignancies, including 86 patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). Notably, 79% of patients experienced an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and 76% had an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are indicative of liver injury. Furthermore, significant increases were observed, with Grade 3 ALT elevations in 26% of patients, Grade 3 AST elevations in 30%, and Grade 4 AST elevations in 3% of patients. The liver enzyme abnormalities were most prevalent during Cycle 1 of treatment and were reversible upon dose interruption.

Warnings and Precautions:
Section 5.3 of the labeling (Hepatotoxicity) specifically addresses the risk of liver enzyme elevation, indicating that treatment with ELZONRIS was associated with this adverse reaction. The labeling recommends monitoring ALT and AST before each infusion and withholding the drug if transaminases exceed five times the upper limit of normal until they return to normal or the adverse reaction is resolved.

Box Warnings:
While not directly related to hepatotoxicity, the Box Warning does emphasize the seriousness of ELZONRIS's adverse reactions, including capillary leak syndrome, which can be life-threatening. This serves to underscore the overall risk profile of the drug, although it does not specifically mention liver injury.

Based on this evidence from clinical trials, as documented in the label sections, there is a clear association between ELZONRIS and the potential for acute liver injury. The relationship is characterized by elevated liver enzymes in a significant portion of treated patients, with a subset experiencing Grade 3 or Grade 4 liver injury. Evidence from other sources, such as case studies or post-marketing surveillance, is not provided but could potentially offer additional insight into the frequency and severity of liver injury associated with tagraxofusp outside of the clinical trial context. Monitoring liver function is recommended as per the drug's warning and precautions to mitigate this risk.","NA

The available evidence from clinical trials and the drug label for tagraxofusp (ELZONRIS) do not provide support for refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and the drug exposure. On the contrary, hepatotoxicity is listed as a warning in the label, with liver enzyme elevations (such as ALT and AST increase) being reported in a significant number of patients in clinical trials. The label explicitly mentions the association and recommends monitoring liver enzymes and withholding treatment if certain thresholds are exceeded, indicating a recognized potential for liver injury as an adverse reaction of tagraxofusp. Therefore, no claim of a lack of association between acute liver injury and tagraxofusp use is supported by the evidence provided."
acute liver injury,telithromycin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to telithromycin (marketed as KETEK) can be gathered from both controlled clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data:

Clinical Trials:
In the controlled Phase III clinical trials involving 4,780 patients (2,702 on KETEK), 1.6% of patients treated with KETEK experienced elevated transaminases (a marker of liver injury) exceeding three times the upper limit of normal, which was similar to the comparator group (1.7%). Additionally, hepatitis, with or without jaundices, was reported in 0.07% of KETEK-treated patients. These events were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing reports have been more concerning regarding hepatic safety. Severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with KETEK. The liver injury was observed during or immediately after treatment, and in some cases, onset was rapid, occurring after administration of only a few doses. While most cases of hepatic dysfunction reported in both post-marketing and clinical trials were mild to moderate, the serious nature of certain post-marketing reports is critical because it represents real-world evidence outside of the controlled trial setting.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials suggests an incidence of liver injury comparable to comparators, but real-world reports from post-marketing surveillance indicate the potential for severe, life-threatening, or even fatal liver injuries. These findings have been significant enough to merit inclusion in the product labeling and to influence the prescribing information with warnings, precautions, and contraindications related to hepatic events. 

Sources:
- Controlled Phase III clinical studies data as reported in the KETEK drug labeling.
- Post-marketing surveillance data as reported in the KETEK drug labeling.

It's essential to note that post-marketing data are subject to reporting biases and lack the controlled conditions of clinical trials, but they provide critical insights into a drug's safety profile in a broader and more diverse patient population.",NA
acute liver injury,temozolomide,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, there is evidence to support the association between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and the administration of temozolomide. This evidence can be broadly categorized into clinical trials experiences and post-marketing experiences:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:**
   - Temozolomide has been evaluated in various safety studies for different indications, such as newly diagnosed glioblastoma, newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma, and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma.
   - The listed adverse reactions from these trials include a range of effects, but there is a specific notation for hepatotoxicity, suggesting that this adverse effect has been observed in the context of clinical trials.
   - The severity and commonality of hepatotoxicity are not as detailed in the adverse reactions section as some other side effects like myelosuppression, but its inclusion indicates clinical recognition.

2. **Post-marketing Experience:**
   - After the approval and widespread use of temozolomide, additional adverse reactions have been reported.
   - These include severe and sometimes fatal hepatotoxicity, as well as liver enzyme elevations, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, and hepatitis.
   - Since this data relies on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, the exact frequency of hepatic injuries related to temozolomide cannot be reliably estimated, and a direct causal relationship is difficult to establish with certainty.
   - However, the consistency and severity of the reported hepatic adverse events post-marketing provide a strong signal that these are related to temozolomide therapy.

3. **Warnings and Precautions:**
   - The temozolomide label includes warnings about the potential risk of hepatotoxicity.
   - It recommends that liver function tests be performed at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the last dose of temozolomide. This recommendation reflects the recognition of hepatotoxicity as a serious adverse reaction and suggests that monitoring is necessary to detect this effect in patients being treated with temozolomide.

In summary, there is evidence from both clinical trial data and post-marketing reports, as well as specific warnings in the prescribing information, to support the relationship between temozolomide use and the development of acute liver injury. Patients treated with temozolomide should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, and further investigation into the incidence and mechanisms of this adverse reaction may be warranted.",NA
acute liver injury,terbinafine,1.0,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Related to Terbinafine Use**

**Clinical Trials:**
As per section 6 of the drug label concerning adverse reactions, liver enzyme abnormalities were documented in clinical trials, affecting 3.31% of patients treated with terbinafine versus 1.4% of those receiving a placebo. This data suggests that liver enzyme elevation, a marker for liver injury, occurs more frequently in patients taking terbinafine compared to those not on the drug. However, the drug label does not explicitly mention acute liver injury in the context of clinical trials' outcomes.

**Postmarketing Surveillance:**
Within section 6.2, detailing the postmarketing experience, there are reports of severe liver injury, including instances of liver failure leading to liver transplant or death, associated with the use of terbinafine. Additionally, hepatitis, cholestasis, and elevations in hepatic enzymes are noted. While these adverse events are self-reported and voluntarily provided, implying a less rigorous collection methodology than in clinical trials, they do indicate a possible link between terbinafine use and hepatotoxicity.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The drug label's section 5 specifies hepatotoxicity concerns with terbinafine, including liver failure leading to transplantation or death in patients with or without preexisting liver disease. The label advises that liver function tests be performed before and during treatment with terbinafine and recommends discontinuation of the medication if liver injury develops. Moreover, it provides guidance on monitoring symptoms indicative of liver injury, such as persistent nausea, fatigue, or jaundice, which should prompt immediate medical evaluation.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials, postmarketing reports, and the explicit warnings in the drug label support a relationship between terbinafine use and the risk of acute liver injury. Clinical trials indicate an increased incidence of liver enzyme abnormalities with terbinafine. Postmarketing surveillance provides reports of severe liver injury, including cases with fatal outcomes, though the absolute frequency cannot be reliably estimated. The drug label contains strong warnings of potential hepatotoxicity, underscoring the necessity for clinicians to monitor liver function and consider the risk of acute liver injury when prescribing terbinafine.","NA

The provided drug label sections indicate that hepatotoxicity, including liver enzyme abnormalities and, in severe cases, liver failure sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, have been associated with the use of terbinafine. There is no evidence presented in the sections provided to refute the relationship between acute liver injury and terbinafine exposure. On the contrary, the warnings and precautions explicitly acknowledge the risk of liver injury with terbinafine use."
acute liver injury,teriflunomide,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and teriflunomide exposure comes from various sources, including clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance, and the drug's prescribing information.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The drug label indicates that in placebo-controlled trials, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 5.8% and 6.2% of patients receiving 7 mg and 14 mg of teriflunomide, respectively, compared to 3.8% of patients receiving placebo. These elevations mostly occurred within the first year of treatment. In clinical trials, a case of ALT 32 times the ULN and jaundice 5 months after initiation of teriflunomide treatment was observed, which required hospitalization and plasmapheresis. The relationship between teriflunomide and liver injury could not be ruled out in this case (Section 5.1 Hepatotoxicity).

Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence:
Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including acute liver failure requiring transplant, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Specifically, severe liver injury that was clinically significant and potentially life-threatening has been documented, pointing towards a causal relationship between teriflunomide exposure and acute liver injury (Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience and Section 5.1 Hepatotoxicity).

Boxed Warning:
The labeling includes a boxed warning, which is the FDA's most serious form of warning. It cautions about clinically significant and life-threatening liver injury that has required liver transplants in the postmarketing setting. Monitoring recommendations are provided, including obtaining transaminase and bilirubin levels before starting therapy and monthly monitoring for six months following treatment initiation (Boxed Warning: Hepatotoxicity).

In summary, the evidence of acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to teriflunomide is supported by clinical trial data, postmarketing surveillance reports, and explicit warnings included in the drug's prescribing information. These sources highlight that liver injury can occur at any time during treatment and in severe cases may lead to acute liver failure requiring transplantation. Monitoring liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended to manage this risk.",NA
acute liver injury,teriflunomide,,"Evidence Summary for Teriflunomide Induced Acute Liver Injury:

**Clinical Trials Evidence**:
Clinical trials have indicated an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, which is a marker of liver injury, in patients taking teriflunomide. Table 1 in the drug label outlines that the adverse reaction of increased ALT occurred in 13% and 15% of patients receiving 7 mg and 14 mg doses of teriflunomide, respectively, compared to 9% of patients taking placebo. Furthermore, the increase in ALT was the most common reason for drug discontinuation. In the safety population of the pooled analysis, comprising 2047 patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, those treated with teriflunomide had elevated ALT levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal ranging from 5.8% to 6.2%, indicating potential liver injury. There was also an instance reported where a patient had ALT elevated to 32 times the upper limit of normal and jaundice, requiring hospitalization and eventual recovery following an accelerated elimination procedure.

**Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence**:
Post-marketing experience of teriflunomide use has identified cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including severe liver injury, such as acute liver failure requiring liver transplant. Through voluntary reports, which are inherently limited by underreporting and bias due to uncertain size and diversity of the population, a causal link between teriflunomide and hepatotoxicity is supported.

**Warnings and Precautions from Drug Labeling**:
The drug label contains a boxed warning indicating the risk of hepatotoxicity with teriflunomide, which is the FDA's strongest form of warning for prescription drugs. Clinical significant liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplantation, has been reported. Monitoring instructions are specified, such as obtaining serum transaminase and bilirubin levels before initiating therapy and monitoring ALT levels monthly for the first six months of treatment. Discontinuation of the drug and initiation of an accelerated elimination procedure are recommended if drug-induced liver injury is suspected.

**Conclusion**:
In summary, the available evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience supports the relationship between teriflunomide exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute liver injury. Monitoring of liver enzymes is crucial in patients receiving this medication, and rapid intervention is recommended if hepatotoxicity is suspected. The specific details provided from the drug label, including adverse reaction reports, clinical trial data, and post-marketing experience, establish this causative relationship.

**Sources**:
The information provided herein is sourced from the adverse reactions, clinical trials experience, and post-marketing experience sections of the drug label for teriflunomide, as provided in the text.",NA
acute liver injury,testosterone,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and testosterone drug exposure can be gathered from sections 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience and 6.2 Postmarketing Experience within the provided drug label information.

**Clinical Trials:** In the adverse event tables from controlled clinical trials listed in section 6.1 of the drug label, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury or liver-related adverse events being commonly associated with testosterone therapy. Abnormal lab tests were reported with incidences greater than or equal to 5%, but these abnormal tests include a range of non-liver-related values such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, lipid profiles, and electrolytes. While liver function abnormalities are grouped under lab test abnormalities, specific incidence rates of liver injury or a clear indication that acute liver injury is a common adverse effect are not detailed in the controlled clinical trials summary provided.

**Postmarketing Experience:** Section 6.2 of the label offers insights into adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of testosterone gel, 1%. Among the adverse reactions reported, hepato-biliary disorders are mentioned, including ""abnormal liver function tests (e.g. transaminases, elevated GGTP, bilirubin)."" This section provides evidence of a potential link between testosterone therapy and liver injury through the observation of adverse reactions in the post-marketing phase. Unlike controlled clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance provides a broader perspective on a drug's safety profile as it includes data from a larger and more diverse patient population using the drug in a real-world setting. However, the label emphasizes that reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain breadth and that it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a clear causal relationship to drug exposure.

In summary, the provided drug label sections do not include acute liver injury as a most common adverse reaction, but postmarketing reports suggest associations with abnormal liver function tests. Given the nature of voluntary reporting, causality is difficult to ascertain without further investigation. Additional data sources such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or a more detailed analysis of post-marketing surveillance data would be necessary to further substantiate the relationship between testosterone therapy and acute liver injury. Conclusively, while there is some evidence suggestive of liver function changes, the specific relationship to acute liver injury is not strongly established in the provided label information.",NA
acute liver injury,tetracycline,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, it indicates that hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) and liver failure have been observed in patients receiving tetracycline, particularly in those with renal impairment. This information suggests a potential association between tetracycline exposure and acute liver injury as part of the broader spectrum of hepatotoxic reactions.

Evidence for the relationship between tetracycline and acute liver injury primarily comes from post-marketing surveillance since the adverse effect is listed under the ""Liver"" sub-section of the drug label's ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section. Post-marketing surveillance typically involves collecting and analyzing data on drug safety from a broad population after a drug has been approved for use. These reports can originate from various sources, including healthcare professionals, patients, and literature cases.

The fact that liver toxicity is specifically mentioned in the label implies that there have been reports of such events following the use of tetracycline that were significant enough to warrant inclusion in the safety information. However, the label does not provide detailed information on the incidence rate, the clinical trials data, or specific case studies. The mention of renal impairment as a risk factor gives some insight into the populations where this adverse effect might be more prevalent.

In general, acute liver injury can be a serious adverse event, and its inclusion in the drug label suggests that healthcare providers should be vigilant when prescribing tetracycline, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease or concomitant renal impairment.

For a more robust and detailed assessment of the evidence, one could search peer-reviewed medical literature for case reports, clinical trial data, and epidemiological studies. These sources may provide further insights into the characteristics of patients who have developed acute liver injury from tetheracycline, the range of clinical presentations, time courses, outcomes, and potential mechanisms of liver toxicity.

In summary, the drug label for tetracycline includes hepatotoxicity and liver failure as potential adverse reactions, with an apparent greater risk in patients with renal impairment. However, the label does not provide detailed evidence from clinical trials or specific case studies, relying instead on observations from post-marketing surveillance. Further investigation into medical literature would be necessary to obtain comprehensive evidence characterizing this adverse reaction.","NA

Given the details provided in the drug label sections for adverse reactions and warnings, there is evidence that tetracycline is associated with hepatotoxicity and liver failure, especially in patients with renal impairment. There is no evidence presented that refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and tetracycline exposure. Hence, it is not accurate to assert that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction of tetracycline when the provided drug label sections explicitly mention hepatotoxicity and liver failure as observed outcomes in some patients receiving the drug."
acute liver injury,thioridazine,,"Despite an extensive review of the adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections of the thioridazine drug label, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a recognized adverse reaction to the medication. While hepatotoxicity, encompassing adverse effects such as jaundice and biliary stasis, is mentioned as a class effect for phenothiazines (the class of drugs to which thioridazine belongs), there is no direct evidence cited in the provided sections connecting thioridazine specifically to acute liver injury.

The adverse effects reported for thioridazine primarily include central nervous system effects such as drowsiness and extrapyramidal symptoms, autonomic nervous system effects like dry mouth and constipation, and cardiovascular issues including QTc prolongation and potential for Torsades de pointes type arrhythmias. Other adverse reactions such as skin conditions, endocrine disturbances, blood dyscrasias, and allergic reactions are also noted.

Regarding hepatotoxicity, caution is advised as phenothiazines as a group have been associated with various liver-related problems, but the document does not provide data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that establishes a causal relationship specifically between thioridazine and acute liver injury.

Since we do not have specific evidence from clinical trials, case reports, or post-market surveillance to correlate thioridazine use directly with acute liver injury, it cannot be concluded that such a relationship exists based solely on the information provided in the drug label.

In summary, while phenothiazines as a class may be associated with hepatotoxicity, there is no direct evidence within the provided sections of the thioridazine drug label to support a relationship between acute liver injury and thioridazine specifically. Further investigation, including extensive review of the medical literature and other sources of clinical data, is needed to adequately evaluate the potential association of acute liver injury with thioridazine.","NA

The provided sections from the drug label do not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and thioridazine exposure. In fact, under Hepatotoxicity in the Phenothiazine Derivates section, it does list ""jaundice"" and ""biliary stasis"", which are indications of liver involvement. Therefore, the information available does not support a refutation of the relationship between thioridazine and potential adverse hepatic reactions."
acute liver injury,tiagabine,,"The provided drug label information for tiagabine, an antiepileptic medication, presents various adverse reactions associated with its use; however, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury specifically related to tiagabine within the sections highlighted. To address the inquiry concerning a potential relationship between tiagabine and acute liver injury, the following points are to be considered based on the data provided:

**Clinical Trials:**
The adverse reactions listed from clinical trials of tiagabine in epilepsy include commonly seen symptoms such as dizziness/light-headedness, asthenia/lack of energy, somnolence, nausea, nervousness/irritability, tremor, abdominal pain, and thinking difficulties. Acute liver injury is not explicitly reported in the clinical trials section provided.

**Study 1 and 2 Overview:**
A dose-response relationship is observed with some adverse effects such as depression, tremor, nervousness, difficulty with concentration/attention, and asthenia. Even at higher doses (32 mg and 56 mg), acute liver injury is not mentioned among the adverse effects.

**Other Clinical Trial Observations:**
There is a listing of various adverse events documented during all phase 2/3 clinical trials of tiagabine, with categorization into frequent, infrequent, and rare events. Under the Digestive System section, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) and liver function tests abnormal are mentioned. These could be indicators of liver-related side effects, yet there is no direct evidence provided that establishes a causal relationship specifically with acute liver injury.

**Post-marketing Surveillance:**
The post-marketing reports mention further adverse reactions identified after the approval of tiagabine, such as skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and eye disorders. Acute liver injury is not cited among them.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the provided sections of the drug label for tiagabine, there is no explicitly reported evidence in the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance that directly links tiagabine to acute liver injury. While liver function abnormalities are noted, these do not necessarily equate to acute liver injury. Without more detailed reports or research studies specifically investigating the incidence of acute liver injury in patients taking tiagabine, a conclusive relationship cannot be established from the information given.

In order to confirm a potential association between tiagabine and acute liver injury, further investigation such as a review of case reports, clinical research beyond the presented clinical trial data, and a deeper analysis of post-marketing reports would be required. In the absence of such data, one must conclude that there is no clear evidence from the provided information to substantiate the claim of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically due to tiagabine exposure.",NA
acute liver injury,ticlopidine,,"Summary of Evidence:
The relationship between acute liver injury and ticloidine comes from post-marketing surveillance, as indicated by the drug label sections provided. In the BOXED WARNING and the WARNING sections of the label, liver-related adverse reactions are explicitly mentioned. These include hepatitis, hepatocellular jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure. These severe hepatic events are classified as rare but have been reported in the postmarketing experience, suggesting a causal link between ticlopidine and acute liver injury.

While the exact incidence of ticlopidine-associated acute liver injury is not provided in the label, the mention of hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure indicates that such events have been observed after the drug's approval and widespread use. This data comes from the US physicians' reports and other postmarketing surveillance data collected between 1992 and 1998, based on an estimated patient exposure of 2 million to 4 million. Given that these events are likely underreported and based on voluntary reports, the true incidence may be higher than suggested by the available data.

There is no mention of acute liver injury in the sections pertaining to the controlled clinical trials. This absence may be due to the rarity of such adverse reactions, which might not be captured in the trial settings due to a smaller sample size and shorter follow-up periods compared to the post-marketing surveillance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while acute liver injury is not among the most commonly reported adverse reactions in the clinical trials of ticlopidine, it is mentioned as a rare but serious adverse reaction in the post-marketing data. This evidence suggests a relationship between ticlopidine exposure and the potential for acute liver injury, warranting inclusion in the warning sections of the drug label. As always, healthcare providers should monitor patients for signs of liver injury during ticlopidine therapy and manage the risks according to clinical guidelines.
",NA
acute liver injury,tinidazole,0.0,"The provided drug label sections for tinidazole do mention several adverse reactions observed during clinical trials and postmarketing experience. However, acute liver injury directly attributed to tinidazole is not prominently featured in the listed common adverse reactions which include neurologic and gastrointestinal effects, hypersensitivity reactions, blood dyscrasias, and others.

In the adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) and clinical studies experience (6.1), we find mention of ""hepatic abnormalities including raised transaminase level"" within the context of pooled data from studies on trichomoniasis, giardiasis, and amebiasis treated with tinidazole. Raised transaminase levels can be indicative of liver injury, but the label does not specify the severity or the clinical relevance in the form of acute liver injury.

In the postmarketing experience (6.2), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury. However, because voluntary reports after approval can encompass a wide range of possible outcomes and the population size is uncertain, it is challenging to estimate the frequency or establish a definite causal relationship between tinidazole exposure and liver injury.

Warnings and precautions (5 WARNINDS AND PRECAUTIONS) sections, which typically highlight significant or serious drug-related adverse effects, do not specifically identify acute liver injury.

Given this information from the label, the relationship between tinidazole and acute liver injury may be considered possible due to the mention of hepatic abnormalities, but there is no strong or specific evidence linking the drug with acute liver injury presented in the clinical trial summaries or listed postmarketing report findings on the label.

Further investigation and study, possibly including a thorough review of the clinical trial data, postmarketing reports, and scientific literature, would be needed to better establish if there is a credible link between tinidazole and acute liver injury. In the absence of explicit data from these sources specifically addressing acute liver injury, we cannot conclude that there is known, strong evidence supporting this relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,tiotropium,,"Based on the provided drug label sections related to tiotropium, there is no evidence directly linking tiotropium to acute liver injury as an adverse reaction within the listed clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data.

Tiotropium is an anticholinergic medication used as a maintenance therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The label does detail various adverse reactions that were observed during the drug's clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Some of the more common adverse reactions (with a frequency of >5% in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials) include upper respiratory tract infection, dry mouth, sinusitis, pharyngitis, non-specific chest pain, urinary tract infection, dyspepsia, and rhinitis. Additional adverse reactions seen in less than 1% of the patients include angioedema, urinary retention, and other conditions where the anticholinergic mechanism of action could be implicated.

Notably, the adverse reactions listed do contain urinary retention, which can, in very rare cases, indirectly cause liver issues if severe obstruction leads to a systemic impact. However, this is not specifically mentioned as acute liver injury, and the evidence does not establish a direct relationship between the drug and liver injury.

The section on warnings and precautions and post-marketing surveillance does not report acute liver injury either. Adverse reactions identified in the post-marketing experience do not include liver-related side effects.

In conclusion, the provided sections of the drug label for tiotropium do not support a relationship between the drug and acute liver injury. If this adverse event were to occur, it appears to be unreported or so rare that it is not included within the provided sections of the label. It is always good practice to report any suspected adverse reactions to appropriate authorities as the label indicates, which allows for ongoing pharmacovigilance and identification of potential drug-adverse effect relationships post-marketing.",NA
acute liver injury,tipranavir,1.0,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Adverse Reaction with Tipranavir Use:**

**Clinical Trials:**
In controlled clinical trials including study 1182.12 and 1182.48 with treatment-experienced adult patients, Grade 3 and 4 elevations in hepatic enzymes (ALT and AST) were observed in patients treated with tipranavir co-administered with ritonavir through week 48 (10.3%, 10.9/100 patient-exposure years). A study in treatment-naïve patients also reported high rates of Grade 3 or 4 hepatic enzyme elevations (20.3%, 21/100 patient-exposure years) when receiving the treatment.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The prescribing information contains a boxed warning regarding hepatotoxicity, noting cases of clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including fatalities. It advises increased vigilance particularly in patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Furthermore, the document specifies the need to discontinue APTIVUS/ritonavir if signs of hepatotoxicity become apparent. It advises liver function test monitoring before and during treatment.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The label indicates that clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, sometimes fatal, have been reported post-marketing. These are usually seen in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and concurrent medications. No direct causal relationship is established, but there is an implication of risk associated with the drug.

**Summary:**
There is substantial evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, reinforced by strong advisories in the prescribing information (including a boxed warning), that supports a relationship between tipranavir (APTIVUS) co-administered with ritonavir and the risk of acute liver injury. Patients with hepatitis B or C co-infection, or with elevated liver enzymes prior to treatment, appear to be at even greater risk for this adverse reaction. Clinical vigilance and regular liver function monitoring are recommended in managing these patients during therapy with tipranavir.",NA
acute liver injury,tizanidine,,"Acute liver injury is identified as a potential adverse reaction of tizanidine based on the evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and recommendations on monitoring liver function included in the sections of the drug label provided.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- The clinical trials section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) lists ""liver function tests abnormal"" as a reported adverse event in multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies with a higher incidence in the tizanidine group compared to placebo (2% vs. <1%). Liver test abnormalities were noted in studies evaluating the effects of tizanidine on spasticity.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
- Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience indicates liver function test abnormalities and hepatotoxicity as observed adverse reactions, with a caveat that the frequency and a causal relationship to drug exposure cannot be reliably estimated due to the voluntary nature of these reports.

Warnings and Precautions:
- Section 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury explicitly warns that tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury and suggests caution in patients with hepatic impairment. It recommends monitoring aminotransferase levels for baseline and 1 month after the maximal dose is reached, or if hepatic injury is suspected.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing reports that suggest a relationship between tizanidine use and acute liver injury. The drug label recommends monitoring liver enzymes as a precaution further supporting the recognition of this potential risk. The exact frequency of acute liver injury related to tizanidine is difficult to determine due to the nature of voluntary postmarketing reports, but clinical studies have noted abnormalities in liver function tests. The inclusion of this information within the warnings section of the drug label underscores the significant concern regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity with tizanidine use.",NA
acute liver injury,tocilizumab,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and tocilizumab comes from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and case reports as documented in various sections of the drug label.

Tocilizumab has been associated with transient or reversible elevations in liver enzymes, particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), during clinical trials. These elevations typically occurred in the context of concomitant treatment with potentially hepatotoxic drugs, such as methotrexate.

- In clinical trials, increased ALT was one of the most common adverse reactions observed, with incidences of elevated ALT greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) across different treatment groups.

- Serious events of hepatic injury, including drug-induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia, were reported infrequently but were recognized as treatment-related adverse reactions. One case was described as serious and was reported in association with tocilizumab usage, indicating a potential event of acute liver injury triggered by the drug.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
During post-marketing surveillance, there have been reports of severe liver injury, including hepatic failure leading to transplantation or death. The reported time to onset has varied, indicating that acute liver injury may occur months to years after initiating tocilizumab therapy.

Case Reports:
Specific case reports are not included in the drug label but are referenced indirectly through post-marketing surveillance data indicating instances of severe hepatic injury.

Drug Label Guidance:
The warnings and precautions section of the drug label articulates that serious cases of hepatic injury, some requiring liver transplant or resulting in death, have occurred with tocilizumab. Moreover, the label advises monitoring of liver function tests before and during therapy and suggests discontinuation of the drug if significant liver enzyme elevations develop.

In summary, the relationship between acute liver injury and tocilizumab is supported by evidence from clinical trials demonstrating liver enzyme elevations, post-marketing reports of severe hepatic injury, and guidance within the drug label specifying monitoring and potential discontinuation due to liver-related adverse reactions. However, the drug label does not specify the incidence of acute liver injury beyond transaminase elevations, nor does it provide detailed individual case data.",NA
acute liver injury,tocilizumab,,"Summary of Evidence for Tocilizumab and Acute Liver Injury:

Clinical Trials:
- The clinical trials referenced (ACTEMRA-IV studies in RA patients) reported increased alanine transaminase (ALT) levels as a common adverse reaction.
- Elevations in liver enzymes were observed and sometimes required intervention such as dosage modification or treatment cessation, indicating potential hepatic adverse reactions.
- One serious case of drug-induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia was reported in association with tocilizumab in Study WA25204. 

Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Post-marketing experience has identified cases of serious hepatic injury, including liver failure and hepatitis. Some cases required liver transplant or resulted in death. 
- Hepatotoxicity warnings highlight that patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of liver injury and abnormal liver tests.
- The drug label advises caution in patients with active hepatic disease or impairment and recommends monitoring liver function tests.

Regulatory and Labeling Information:
- Tocilizumab's prescribing information includes a warning regarding hepatotoxicity, advising monitoring of liver enzymes and the need for caution in patients with hepatic disease.

In conclusion, there is evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and regulatory documentation that tocilizumab can be associated with acute liver injury, including serious cases. The evidence comes from observed increases in liver enzymes, reports of serious hepatic injury in clinical practice, and specific warnings and precautions included in the prescribing information.

acute liver injury,tolcapone,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and tolcapone exposure is documented in both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, and is detailed in the provided drug label sections under ADVERSE REACTIONS and WARNINGS.

Clinical Trials:
The clinical trial data involving over 3,400 patients treated with tolcapone tablets suggest that liver enzyme elevations (SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST) are more likely to occur within the first 6 months of treatment. These findings are based on systematic laboratory monitoring during the studies.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
Since tolcapone's approval and widespread use, which amounts to over 40,000 patient-years worldwide, there have been reports of severe hepatocellular injury, including fatal cases of fulminant hepatic failure. As stated in the provided drug label, up until May 2005, three cases of fatal liver failure have been associated with tolcapone use, with all cases occurring within six months of treatment initiation. The observed incidence of fatal hepatic failure may be significantly higher (10- to 100-fold) than the estimated background incidence rate in the general population.

Underreporting:
It is acknowledged that there might be an underreporting of cases, which could lead to an underestimation in the risk of liver injury associated with tolcapone.

Risk Evaluation:
The evidence suggests that the risk of liver injury is more substantial in the initial months of therapy, and heightened vigilance and liver monitoring are recommended during this period. It is not guaranteed that periodic monitoring of liver enzymes will prevent fulminant liver failure, but early detection and drug discontinuation improve recovery chances.

Furthermore, the drug label advises that tolcapone should not be initiated in patients with clinical evidence of liver disease or elevated baseline liver enzymes and should be discontinued if significant liver enzyme elevations occur.

Overall, the relationship between tolcapone and acute liver injury is supported by clinical data and real-world reports indicating that tolcapone therapy is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular injury, including cases of liver failure resulting in death. The information provided is clear, and the sources are the clinical trial monitoring data and the post-marketing adverse event reports documented in the drug label.","NA

The provided drug label sections for tolcapone clearly indicate an association between acute liver injury and the use of the drug. Clinical evidence, including cases of severe hepatocellular injury, fulminant liver failure resulting in death, and increases in liver enzymes, support the relationship between acute liver injury and tolcapone exposure. Therefore, it is not appropriate to present evidence refuting this adverse reaction since it is a recognized risk of the medication."
acute liver injury,tolvaptan,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for tolvaptan, the evidence for a relationship between acute liver injury and drug exposure comes from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials:
According to the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2) of the drug label, serious liver injury, including cases leading to liver failure requiring liver transplantation, has been observed specifically in placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). These cases of serious liver injury were generally reported to occur within the first 18 months of therapy.

Post-marketing Experience:
In the post-marketing surveillance data, as described in the same section (5.2), acute liver injury resulting in liver failure that required liver transplantation has been reported. This underscores that the liver injury was significant enough to manifest in the broader patient population outside the controlled setting of clinical trials.

Additional Information:
As a result of the evidence of hepatotoxicity, the label includes strong warnings, including a boxed warning advising against the use of tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD outside of a specific FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) due to this risk of liver injury. Moreover, there is a recommendation to limit the duration of therapy with tolvaptan to 30 days and to avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because of the potential for the impaired ability to recover from liver injury.

In conclusion, the evidence linking acute liver injury to tolvaptan exposure comes from clinical trial findings and post-marketing reports in patients, particularly those treated for ADPKD. The drug label contains strong precautions against the use of tolvaptan in patients with certain liver conditions and advises clinicians to discontinue treatment if liver injury is suspected.","NA

The provided label information for tolvaptan includes several adverse reactions and warnings but does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and tolvaptan exposure. In fact, it states clearly under Warnings and Precautions (section 5.2) that tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury, with cases generally occurring during the first 18 months of therapy. Additionally, liver injury is cited as a reason to discontinue treatment and to avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis. Therefore, it is acknowledged in the label that there is a risk of hepatotoxicity with tolvaptan use, especially in the context of treating autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

Moreover, actual cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan are mentioned, and the text advises to discontinue treatment for patients showing symptoms that may indicate liver injury. There is no presentation of evidence to disprove that acute liver injury could be an adverse reaction to tolvaptan within the label.

Given that acute liver injury is listed as a potential adverse reaction associated with the drug, specific evidence refuting this relationship is not present in the supplied label information."
acute liver injury,tolvaptan,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and tolvaptan exposure primarily originates from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data, as referenced in the provided drug label sections:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: While the provided sections of the label primarily discuss the common adverse reactions experienced by patients during clinical trials, such as thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia, it is mentioned in the warnings and precautions that serious and potentially fatal liver injury has been observed during placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

2. **Warnings and Precautions (5.2 Liver Injury)**: There is strong evidence from clinical trials that tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occurring within the first 18 months of therapy, were observed in the ADPKD patient population. There have also been post-marketing reports of acute liver injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation when patients with ADPKD used tolvaptan.

3. **Post-marketing Experience**: Reports gathered from the period after tolvaptan received FDA approval indicate adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of SAMSCA (tolvaptan). However, because these reactions are reported voluntarily and the size of the population is unknown, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials explicitly identifies a risk of serious liver injury, including acute injury leading to liver failure, associated with tolvaptan exposure, particularly observed in the patient population with ADPKD. Post-marketing reports further suggest similar observations in wider patient use, although these are not as systematically collected as in trials. Based on this information, severe liver injury is recognized as an important potential adverse reaction of tolvaptan, leading to recommendations for careful monitoring, limited treatment duration, and avoidance in patients with underlying liver disease or ADPKD (outside of the REMS program).","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, acute liver injury is identified as a potential risk associated with the use of tolvaptan, particularly in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The label explicitly states that tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury and advises against the use of tolvaptan in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, due to impaired ability to recover from liver injury. There is also a specific warning about the limitation of treatment duration to 30 days to reduce the risk of liver injury. Therefore, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and tolvaptan exposure; rather, liver injury is an acknowledged risk of tolvaptan use in certain conditions."
acute liver injury,topiramate,,"Clinical and Post-Marketing Evidence:

**Evidence from Clinical Trials:**
The label for topiramate includes a comprehensive list of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, but acute liver injury is not listed among the common adverse reactions for either epilepsy or migraine treatment in adults or pediatric patients. This suggests that in clinical trials, acute liver injury was not identified as a frequent adverse effect directly associated with topiramate at the doses studied.

**Case Studies:**
The absence of acute liver injury from the common adverse reactions in the label does not preclude the occurrence of such an event. Case studies and individual reports in the scientific literature might offer evidence of such a relationship. However, the provided label information does not include case reports; thus, a literature search would be necessary to identify any case reports or case series describing acute liver injury in patients taking topiramate.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The post-marketing experience section of the label mentions hepatic failure (including fatalities), hepatitis, and pancreatitis as adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of topiramate. These reports are voluntarily submitted and provide insight into rare but serious adverse events that may not have been captured during clinical trials due to the larger and more diverse population exposed to the medication after approval. While these post-marketing reports do suggest a possible link between topiramate and severe liver-related adverse effects, the frequency and causality are less clearly established compared to evidence typically gathered from controlled clinical trials.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the information provided from the label, acute liver injury is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the controlled clinical trial setting for topiramate. However, post-marketing surveillance suggests a potential association between topiramate and severe liver adverse events, such as hepatic failure and hepatitis. It is important to note that such associations require careful evaluation of the patient's clinical history, concomitant medications, and other risk factors that may contribute to liver injury. To establish a more definitive relationship between topiramate and acute liver injury, further investigation such as a review of literature and evaluation of individual case reports would be necessary.

acute liver injury,toremifene,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for toremifene (FARESTON), evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and toremifene exposure can be derived from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Liver function test abnormalities were reported. Specifically, the North American Study showed that 5% of patients on FARESTON 60 mg had aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations, and 1.5% had elevated bilirubain. The Eastern European and Nordic studies showed even higher incidences, with AST elevations up to 19% and 15%, respectively, in the FARESTON 60 mg treatment groups.
- The incidence of AST elevations was greater in the high-dose toremifene (200 and 240 mg) arms compared to the tamoxifen arms.
- Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in approximately 1% of patients included abnormal liver function tests; one case of toxic hepatitis was noted as a reason for withdrawal due to high-dose toremifene treatment.

Post-marketing Experience:
- Hepatotoxicity has been identified during post-approval use, including reports of increases in serum concentrations for grade 3 and 4 transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, as well as jaundice, hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- Due to these observations, liver function tests are recommended periodically.

Warnings:
- The label includes warnings regarding hepatotoxicity, advising that liver function tests should be conducted periodically to monitor for potential liver injury.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance reports indicate that acute liver injury, including transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, is an adverse reaction of toremifene. These findings are further underscored by the inclusion of hepatotoxicity warnings in the drug's label. Thus, healthcare providers should monitor liver function tests in patients treated with toremifene and consider these risks when prescribing the medication.",NA
acute liver injury,torsemide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for torsemide, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an identified adverse reaction in the clinical trial experience (6.1) or in the postmarketing experience (6.2). The clinical trials included approximately 4,000 subjects, with more than 800 subjects receiving torsemide for at least 6 months and over 380 for more than a year. The most common adverse reaction reported was excessive urination.

The postmarketing experience, which reflects adverse reactions identified after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use, does not list acute liver injury either. Instead, it mentions an increase in liver transaminases and gamma-glutamyltransferase, which can indicate liver stress but does not conclusively point to acute liver injury.

The warnings and precautions (5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) focus on hypotension and worsening renal function, electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and ototoxicity, with no specific warning about acute liver injury.

In conclusion, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence supporting a relationship between torsemide exposure and acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. It is important to note that postmarketing reports are voluntary and the true incidence of adverse reactions can be underreported; however, acute liver injury is not listed among the recognized adverse reactions for torsemide in the label information provided. If there are concerns or new evidence for acute liver injury related to torsemide use, it would typically be reported through post-marketing surveillance mechanisms like the FDA MedWatch program.",NA
acute liver injury,trabectedin,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:

Trabectedin, marketed under the brand name Yondelis, has been evaluated for safety in clinical trials involving patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Within these trials, liver toxicity has been identified as an adverse reaction. Specifically, in the pivotal Trial ET743-SAR-3007, wherein 378 patients with previously treated leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma received trabectedin, the incidence of Grade 3-4 elevated liver function tests (LFTs) was 35% (134/378 patients). Grade 3-4 elevations indicate a severe adverse reaction, and these numbers underscore liver injury as a notable risk with trabectedin therapy.

The median time to the development of significant elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 29 days, showing that liver injury can be an early complication. Furthermore, among the affected patients, most experienced recovery with a median time to resolution of 13 days after the onset of hepatic adverse reaction. Additionally, 1.3% of patients (5/378) experienced drug-induced liver injury characterized by concurrent elevations in ALT and AST, alongside bilirubin elevation.

Evidence from Case Studies and Post-marketing Experience:

The drug label for trabectedin also includes information from the post-marketing experience, which, although less controlled than clinical trials, offers real-world evidence of drug safety concerns. Cases of hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure, have been reported during post-approval use, supporting the findings from clinical trials.

Safeguards and Recommendations:

To mitigate the risk, the drug label recommends monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) prior to each administration of trabectedin and as clinically indicated. For patients experiencing hepatotoxicity, recommendations include treatment interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation based on severity and duration of the liver function abnormality.

Summary:

In conclusion, there is clear evidence from clinical trials, particularly from the data reflected in Trial ET743-SAR-3007, that trabectedin can cause acute liver injury, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and other markers of hepatotoxicity. Post-marketing experiences further substantiate these findings. The drug labeling includes explicit warnings regarding hepatotoxicity, underlining the importance of monitoring and managing this risk in patients treated with trabectedin.","NA

The sections provided from the drug label indicate that hepatotoxicity, which includes hepatic failure and acute liver injury, is indeed a known adverse reaction associated with trabectedin (YONDELIS). Section 5.3 directly addresses hepatotoxicity with specific data from clinical trials, highlighting an incidence of Grade 3-4 elevated liver function tests in 35% of patients receiving trabectedin and details on drug-induced liver injury. Therefore, since the drug label specifies hepatotoxicity as a risk, refuting evidence regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and trabectedin exposure would not be available within this provided context."
acute liver injury,tramadol,,"In the extensive provided drug label sections concerning tramadol, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as a specific adverse reaction to the drug. The sections detail various other serious adverse reactions, common side effects, and postmarketing experiences with tramadol, but acute liver injury is not explicitly listed.

Post-marketing surveillance (section 6.2 of the label) describes several experiences with tramadol, including gastrointestinal adverse events such as hepatitis, which is an inflammation of the liver that could potentially lead to liver injury. However, liver failure is explicitly mentioned under ""Gastrointestinal"" adverse reactions. This could infer that there have been cases of significant liver-related adverse events, including acute liver injury, during post-marketing experience, although the label does not provide explicit incidence rates or causal relationship establishment.

In summary, the drug label provided mentions liver failure as a potential adverse reaction from post-marketing experience but does not provide a detailed causal relationship or incidence rate specific to acute liver injury. This indicates that while there is an acknowledgement of serious liver events associated with tramadol usage, the evidence is likely derived from post-marketing reports and not from controlled clinical trials. Therefore, the direct evidence supporting a relationship specifically between acute liver injury and tramadol is not detailed in the label, suggesting that such occurrences might be rare or not well-documented in a controlled clinical trial context. Always consider that new evidence might emerge, and further surveillance and research could provide additional insights regarding this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,trandolapril,1.0,"Based on the available information from the drug label sections provided, acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to trandolapril is supported by the documentation under ""Liver Function Tests"" that indicates occasional elevation of transaminases occurred at a rate of 3 times the upper normal limit in 0.8% of patients. Additionally, a persistent increase in bilirubin occurred in 0.2% of patients. Furthermore, discontinuation due to elevated liver enzymes occurred in 0.2% of patients taking trandolapril. This evidence suggests a potential relationship between trandolapril exposure and liver injury.

It is important to note that in post-marketing experience, jaundice and hepatitis, which are indicative of significant liver injury, were reported. However, because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the label acknowledges that it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The presented clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data are specific and related to the safety and adverse event profile of trandolapril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension and other conditions. The adverse reactions are listed as occurring at incidences higher than placebo, including increased liver enzymes, among others.

No evidence from dedicated, prospective clinical studies specifically aiming to investigate the association between trandolapril and acute liver injury has been provided here. The evidence is derived from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and laboratory test findings, with the latter capturing changes in liver enzyme levels during treatment.

In summary, while data from the drug label suggest an association between trandolapril use and liver injury characterized by transaminase elevations and rare cases of jaundice or hepatitis, the evidence primarily hinges on observed clinical adverse reactions and laboratory findings without a definitive established causal relationship. Given that the reported adverse liver events are relatively infrequent, healthcare providers should monitor liver enzymes when administering trandolapril, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those on concomitant medications affecting liver function.",NA
acute liver injury,tranylcypromine,,"According to the provided drug label sections for tranylcypromine, there is evidence to suggest that acute liver injury can occur as an adverse reaction to this drug.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
The provided sections do not specify detailed results from clinical trials regarding hepatotoxicity. However, the drug label indicates that hepatitis and elevated aminotransferases have been observed, which implies that evidence of hepatotoxicity may have arisen during clinical trials or that hepatic adverse effects are known pharmacologic outcomes of tranylcypromine therapy. Clinical trials have generally reported a range of adverse reactions, but since the label does not detail the incidence of hepatic events from these trials, the specific rates of acute liver injury cannot be gleaned from this information.

**Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The label mentions that hepatitis and elevated aminotransferases have been identified during post-approval use of tranylcypromine sulfate. These findings typically originate from case studies and reports submitted to monitoring systems like the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which suggests that acute liver injury as an adverse reaction was observed during the drug's post-marketing experience.

**Hepatotoxicity Warning:**
The drug label includes a specific warning (5.10 Hepatotoxicity) that hepatitis and elevated aminotransferases have been reported and advises monitoring patients accordingly. It is also recommended that tranylcypromine should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Such a warning indicates recognition of the risk of acute liver injury with tranylcypromine use and is designed to guide healthcare providers in monitoring and managing these potential events.

In conclusion, while the drug label does not provide specific data on the incidence of acute liver injury from clinical trials, hepatotoxicity is recognized in the post-marketing experience and is included as a specific warning in the drug's prescribing information. This implies that there is a known association between tranylcypromine and the potential for acute liver injury, but the exact frequency and character of this adverse reaction remain unspecified in the provided label sections. Healthcare providers should monitor liver function in patients taking tranylcypromine and consider discontinuing the drug if hepatotoxicity is suspected.",NA
acute liver injury,trastuzumab,,"The provided drug label information for trastuzumab does not specifically list acute liver injury as a known adverse reaction. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody used primarily in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, has a well-documented adverse effect profile that includes cardiomyopathy, infusion reactions, embryo-fetal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, neutropenia, infections, and gastrointestinal disturbances among others. 

Liver injury or hepatotoxicity is not mentioned as a common adverse effect within the provided label sections. Additionally, clinical trial data summarized does not indicate a prevalence of liver-related adverse events in patients receiving trastuzumab. Clinical monitoring parameters included in the label, such as cardiomyopathy monitoring, do not encompass routine liver function tests, suggesting that liver injury is not a routine concern with trastuzumab treatment.

According to the details provided in the adverse reactions (section 6), as compiled from multiple clinical trials, no incidence of acute liver injury has been highlighted or reported in a manner that draws particular attention to this potential side effect.

Post-marketing experience in section 6.1 lists rare glomerulopathy but does not mention acute liver injury or hepatotoxicity among the post-approval adverse reactions. The immunogenicity subsection 6.2 details antibody formation in patients, not liver injury. The warnings and precautions (section 5) elaborate on other risks such as cardiomyopathy, infusion reactions, and exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, but do not delineate liver injury as a significant risk.

Summarizing the evidence, there is no explicit support within the provided drug label sections for a relationship between trastuzumab exposure and acute liver injury. Should additional detailed search be warranted outside of drug label sections, such as in scientific literature or comprehensive databases, this conclusion may need to be revisited. However, based on the current information from the drug label, no known evidence supports a direct link between trastuzumab and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,trastuzumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for KADCYLA (trastuzumab emtansine), hepatotoxicity, including incidents of acute liver injury, has been identified as an adverse reaction in clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Here's a summary of the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance:

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
1. **Hepatotoxicity Warning**: The presence of a specific warning for hepatotoxicity, including reporting of liver failure and death, suggests a recognized risk associated with KADCYLA.
2. **Adverse Reactions and Lab Findings**: Increased transaminases (a marker for liver damage) were among the most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials. The EMILIA trial reported that 43% of patients experienced Grade ≥3 adverse reactions, with increased transaminases being one of the leading reasons for KADCYLA discontinuation. 
3. **Serious Liver Injury Cases**: Serious hepatotoxicity, including three fatal cases, occurred among 1624 patients treated with KADCYLA in clinical trials. 
4. **Nodular Regenerative Hyperplasia (NRH)**: NRH, a rare liver condition that may lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, was diagnosed in five patients from liver biopsies, with one fatal case.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
1. **Post-Marketing Adverse Reactions**: The label mentions that serious hepatotoxicity has been reported during post-approval use, which signals ongoing concerns regarding liver-related injuries in the broader patient population.

The label does not provide incidence rates or detailed case study reports for hepatotoxicity from post-marketing surveillance, but the inclusion of hepatotoxicity in the warning section and the necessity for monitoring liver function suggest a clearly established risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, associated with KADCYLA treatment.

Pharmacovigilance efforts such as reporting suspected adverse reactions to Genentech or the FDA contribute to monitoring the drug's safety profile. Clinicians are advised to monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin levels before treatment initiation and before each dose, and to use dose adjustments or discontinuation to manage hepatotoxicity in patients treated with KADCYLA.

Sources:

acute liver injury,tremelimumab,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Tremelimumab:

Tremelimumab, under the brand name IMJUDO, is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the CTLA-4 pathway, thereby enhancing the immune response. It is used in combination with another checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, and in some cases with platinum-based chemotherapy. While the provided drug label sections mention various immune-mediated adverse reactions, we will specifically focus on acute liver injury.

Immune-Mediated Hepatitis:
- The label notes that tremelimumab, in combination with durvalumab, can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, which can be severe or induce a fatal outcome. The data reflects experiences from two clinical studies, HIMALAYA (uHCC population) and POSEIDON (NSCLC population).
- In the HIMALAYA study (uHCC), conducted on 388 patients who received tremelimumab and durvalumab, immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7.5% of patients, with fatal outcomes in 0.8%, Grade 4 in 0.3%, and Grade 3 in 4.1%.
- In the POSEIDON study (NSCLC) on patients who received tremelimumab with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (596 patients pooled population), immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 3.9% of patients, including at least one fatality (0.3%), Grade 4 (0.5%), and Grade 3 (2%) adverse reactions.

Detailed stats on the incidence of immune-mediated hepatitis and further management such as treatment discontinuation, corticosteroids requirement, and resolution outcomes are provided for both studies.

Laboratory Abnormalities:
- The label from the HIMALAYA study lists Grade 3 or 4 elevations in liver enzymes such as Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) in 7% and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in 3% of patients.
- These laboratory abnormalities suggest hepatic injury and complement the clinical findings of hepatitis linked with the drug.

Recommendations:
- The label provides guidance on the management of immune-mediated adverse reactions, including close monitoring of liver function.
- It also includes specific instructions for withholding or discontinuing treatment based on the severity of immune-mediated hepatitis.
- In the event of immune-mediated hepatitis, the label advises administering systemic corticosteroids and possibly other immunosuppressants in unresponsive cases.

Fatal Adverse Reactions:
- Notably, fatal reactions, including immune-mediated hepatitis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, supporting the drug's potential to cause severe liver injury.

While the mentioned clinical trials, HIMALAYA and POSEIDON, provide evidence of the associated risk of immune-mediated hepatitis (including severe, sometimes fatal outcomes) with tremelimumab in patients with hepatic and pulmonary malignancies, it is important to be wary of the possibility of acute liver injury occurring in patients treated with this medication. These results should be interpreted with caution and in the context of the treatment benefits. Post-marketing surveillance will further clarify the frequency and severity of acute liver injury in the broader patient population.

acute liver injury,tretinoin,,"Evidence from the provided drug label suggests that acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) can occur as an adverse reaction to tretinoin. The specific evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and tretinoin exposure includes:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Hepatotoxicity is listed under the Warnings and Precautions (5.7) section of the label, indicating monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.
   - Elevations in liver function test results occurred in 50% to 60% of patients during treatment with tretinoin capsules, as mentioned in the Hepatotoxicity section.
   - Adverse reactions in patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) who received tretinoin capsules include hepatosplenomegaly (9%), hepatitis (3%), and unspecified liver disorder (3%).

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Although specific quantitative data on acute liver injury post-marketing is not provided, Hepatotoxicity is again emphasized in the post-marketing surveillance as an adverse reaction, noting that the frequency of these events or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is less reliable due to voluntary nature of reporting.

Considering the evidence presented in the drug label, it is reasonable to conclude a potential relationship between tretinoin exposure and acute liver injury. It is recommended that healthcare professionals closely monitor liver function in patients taking tretinoin and consider modifying or discontinuing therapy if significant liver function abnormalities develop.

Clinical trials and post-marketing experiences are the sources of evidence for hepatotoxicity related to tretinoin. However, it is worth noting that specific details on the prevalence or incidence rates of acute liver injury from clinical trials are not provided in the label excerpt. Similarly, clear causality and incidence rates from post-marketing surveillance cannot be determined due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the lack of a control group in this setting. Therefore, while hepatotoxicity is recognized as an adverse reaction, precise risk quantification requires further study.",NA
acute liver injury,triamterene,,"The drug label information provided for triamterene includes acute liver injury, manifested as jaundice and/or liver enzyme abnormalities, under the gastrointestinal adverse reactions section. This indicates that there has been recognition of a potential relationship between triamterene and acute liver injury.

Clinical trials are typically the primary source for detecting adverse reactions; however, due to their controlled nature and the limited number of patients involved, some adverse events may only emerge during post-marketing surveillance when the drug is used in a broader population. The drug label does not specify the phase of clinical trials in which liver injury was observed, but it lists this adverse effect as occurring rarely (1 in 1000 or less), which suggests that it has been documented in a small number of patients.

Additionally, the section on how to report suspected adverse reactions, which includes contact information for TruPharma, LLC, and the FDA, points towards post-marketing surveillance data contributing to the knowledge about this adverse reaction. Post-marketing surveillance, including adverse event reporting systems like the FDA's MedWatch, helps to gather information on adverse reactions that may not have been fully understood during pre-market research.

In summary, the evidence for acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to triamterene is supported by its inclusion on the drug label, indicating that instances of jaundice and/or liver enzyme abnormalities have been recorded, albeit rarely, with its use. The exact sources in terms of clinical trial data or specific case studies are not provided, but the information on the label typically results from a combination of clinical study observations and post-market surveillance that regulators and manufacturers use to monitor and evaluate the safety profile of a drug.",NA
acute liver injury,triazolam,,"The drug label for triazolam does not include acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction (incidence ≥4% and twice placebo) based on the provided adverse reactions section (6.1) from clinical trial experiences. The common adverse reactions listed include drowsiness, dizziness, light-headedness, and coordination disorders/ataxia.

Post-marketing surveillance, however, has shed light on additional adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials due to the larger and more diverse patient population in real-world settings. In section 6.2, ""Postmarketing Experience"" of the label, hepatobiliary disorders such as jaundice are mentioned, which can be indicative of liver dysfunction. Additionally, there is a report of ""death from hepatic failure in a patient also receiving diuretic drugs,"" suggesting that there may be a potential concern for acute liver injury related to triazolam use in the post-marketing experience.

It is important to note that such cases from post-marketing surveillance may not always establish a clear causal relationship due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the lack of controlled conditions. Moreover, the patient who was reported to have died from hepatic failure was concurrently receiving diuretic drugs, which suggests the possibility of drug interactions or underlying vulnerabilities influencing the liver injury.

In conclusion, the clinical trials did not show a clear association between triazolam use and acute liver injury, but the post-marketing surveillance data indicates that there have been rare cases of liver-related adverse effects, including at least one fatality involving hepatic failure. Nevertheless, establishing a definitive causal relationship between triazolam exposure and acute liver injury would require further investigation, including detailed analysis of individual cases, to account for potential confounding factors such as polypharmacy, comorbidities, and the presence of other liver insults.",NA
acute liver injury,trifluoperazine,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no direct evidence outlined for acute liver injury being an adverse reaction specifically associated with trifluoperazine. However, the label does mention ""liver damage (jaundice, biliary stasis)"" in the general context of adverse reactions observed with trifluoperazine hydrochloride or other phenothiazine derivatives. This suggests that liver damage, which can include acute liver injury, has been reported as an adverse effect within the broader class of phenothiazines, to which trifluoperazine belongs.

The document does not include specific details such as the frequency of these events, or whether these observations were made in the context of clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance, making it difficult to ascertain the strength of the evidence regarding trifluoperazine and acute liver injury. It is important to note that the liver damage mentioned in the label could cover a range of liver-related adverse effects, and as such, further information would be needed to specifically link trifluoperazine use to acute liver injury.

In summary, the drug label suggests that liver damage is a known, but possibly rare, adverse effect of phenothiazine derivatives, including trifluoperazine. However, the label does not provide detailed evidence to conclusively establish a relationship between acute liver injury and trifluoperazine exposure. Due to the lack of specificity and detail in the drug label, additional sources, such as peer-reviewed studies, database reviews, or detailed post-marketing reports, would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of acute liver injury associated with trifluoperazine.",NA
acute liver injury,tucatinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and tucatinib exposure can be derived from clinical trial data and safety information provided in the drug label, specifically under sections related to adverse reactions and warnings.

From the provided label sections:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - The label mentions hepatotoxicity as one of the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine.
   - A notable proportion of patients experienced serious adverse reactions to tucatinib, with hepatotoxicity leading to treatment discontinuation in 1.5% of patients and dose reductions due to hepatotoxicity in 8% of patients.
   - Hepatotoxicity included increased liver enzymes and bilirubin, indicating potential liver injury.
   - The table of laboratory abnormalities shows elevated levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and bilirubin, which are indicative of liver injury, in a significant number of patients compared to placebo, with a higher percentage of grades ≥3 increases in these enzymes in the tucatinib group.

2. Hepatotoxicity Warning:
   - A warning cautions about severe hepatotoxicity reported with tucatinib, including advice for monitoring liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to and during treatment.
   - Instructions for dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation based on severity are also provided, further indicating a potential causal relationship between tucatinib and hepatotoxicity.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - There is no specific mention of post-marketing surveillance data for tucatinib-related hepatotoxicity in the provided information. This typically includes data collected from real-world use after approval and can provide additional insight into the occurrence of adverse reactions such as liver injury.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials indicates a relationship between tucatinib exposure and acute liver injury, as observed by the occurrence of adverse reactions related to hepatotoxicity, such as elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. This is further supported by the warnings and precautions detailed in the label, which also serve as a guide for healthcare providers to monitor and manage these potential adverse reactions in patients receiving tucatinib. The full extent of hepatotoxicity and causality would be further characterized by extensive post-marketing surveillance, which is not detailed here.",NA
acute liver injury,upadacitinib,,"Based on the provided safety information from clinical trials and warnings as labeled for upadacitinib (RINVOQ), there is evidence suggesting a potential relationship between liver enzyme elevations—an indicator of liver injury—and upadacitinib exposure. Here is a focused summary of the relevant evidence, particularly addressing acute liver injury:

### Clinical Trial Evidence:
- *Hepatic Transaminase Elevations*: Clinical trials have shown increased incidences of liver enzyme elevations (Alanine transaminase [ALT] and Aspartate transaminase [AST]) in patients treated with upadacitinib compared to placebo.
- Specifically, elevations of ALT and AST to ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in a higher proportion of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg compared to patients receiving placebo during the placebo-controlled trials with background disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for up to 12/14 weeks.

### Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- According to the label, post-marketing data are usually used to update the adverse reactions section of the labeling with rare but serious events that may not be detected in clinical trials due to limited sample sizes and duration of the trial.
- The adverse reaction section does not specifically list acute liver injury or some of the more serious consequences of liver enzyme elevations, such as severe hepatotoxicity or liver failure, which may suggest that such reactions are not commonly reported or not established through post-marketing surveillance as related to the drug up to the knowledge cutoff.

### Warnings Related to Hepatic Effects:
- The labeling includes a warning about the potential for elevations in liver enzymes, and it is recommended that liver enzymes should be evaluated at baseline and monitored periodically thereafter.

### Absence of Boxed Warnings for Liver Injury:
- The absence of a boxed warning for acute liver injury indicates that while liver enzyme elevations have been observed, the available evidence does not rise to a level of risk that would warrant the most serious form of warning by FDA standards.

### Overall Evaluation:
- Elevation of liver enzymes, which can be indicative of liver injury or stress, is reported in patients treated with upadacitinib.
- However, the precise link between upadacitinib and acute, clinically significant liver injury requiring intervention such as hospitalization or leading to liver failure is not detailed in the provided information.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials that upadacitinib can cause liver enzyme elevations, which might indicate acute liver injury. However, the labeling does not specify acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction, nor is there a boxed warning related to severe liver-related outcomes, suggesting that if such events occur, they may be rare or not definitively attributed to the drug based on currently available data. Healthcare professionals should monitor liver enzymes as recommended and manage as per clinical guidelines.",NA
acute liver injury,ursodeoxycholate,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label pertaining to ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol), it does not appear that acute liver injury is listed among the adverse reactions discovered in the clinical trials or post-marketing experience provided. The adverse reactions identified with a 5% or greater incidence level in both gallstone dissolution and gallstone prevention among patients taking ursodiol do not include acute liver injury, but rather encompass other reactions such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and various other systemic symptoms.

Furthermore, in the post-marketing experience section, there is no specific mention of acute liver injury either. Instead, this section lists gastrointestinal disorders such as enteroliths (bezoars).

It is important to note that post-marketing surveillance might not capture every possible adverse event due to underreporting or other factors, and the lack of mention does not necessarily indicate that the event cannot occur.

In the absence of reporting acute liver injury as an adverse reaction in these provided sections of the drug label, and without additional information from other sources such as case studies or further research data, it is appropriate to conclude that there is no known evidence within the provided label sections to support a direct relationship between ursodexycholate exposure and acute liver injury.

To arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the drug's safety profile, it would be important to consider the larger corpus of medical literature and databases, which might contain case reports or observational studies that could suggest an association not captured in randomized clinical trials or not observed at a high enough frequency to be included in the summary of product characteristics. However, based on the information provided from the drug label, acute liver injury is not identified as an established adverse reaction to ursodeoxycholate.",NA
acute liver injury,valacyclovir,,"Evidence from the provided drug label suggests that acute liver injury can occur as an adverse reaction to valacyclovir, with liver enzyme abnormalities and hepatitis identified during postmarketing use (Section 6.3 Postmarketing Experience). It’s important to note that these observations come from voluntary reports, and as such, their frequency cannot be precisely determined. Furthermore, the causal relationship is typically harder to establish from postmarketing surveillance due to the uncontrolled nature of reporting. 

From the data presented, clinical trials (Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients) showed that frequencies of abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT, a liver enzyme) levels (>2 times the upper limit of normal) were slightly higher in patients receiving valacyclovir compared to placebo in the context of treating cold sores (1.8% versus 0.8%). Although this increase was noted, it does not specifically imply acute liver injury but indicates a possible impact on liver function.

Acute liver injury as a specific entity is not detailed within the controlled clinical trial sections (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients and 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients). However, elevated liver enzymes could potentially lead to or be indicative of liver injury if significant enough. 

Moreover, in the context of hepatitis (which can involve acute liver injury), the drug label only references hepatitis in the Postmarketing Experience section (6.3), which denotes adverse events selected for inclusion based on their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to the drug but again lacks detailed incidence data and controlled comparisons to establish a definite causal relationship.

In summary, there are postmarketing reports of liver enzyme abnormalities and hepatitis associated with valacyclovir use, which signals a potential for acute liver injury. Elevated ALT levels noted in clinical trials may also point toward liver effect but are not directly indicative of acute liver injury. The nature of the reporting systems and study designs do not allow for a definitive causal link to be confirmed solely based on the information provided. Further investigation such as controlled observational studies may be required to establish a stronger evidence base for the relationship between valacyclovir and acute liver injury.","According to the provided drug label sections concerning valacyclovir (valacyclovir hydrochloride), there is evidence suggesting a relationship between valacyclovir and elevations in liver enzymes, which can indicate liver injury. Specifically, the label mentions instances of ""liver enzyme abnormalities"" and hepatitis in the postmarketing experience section (6.3 Hepatobiliary Tract and Pancreas). 

Additionally, during clinical trials, there was a report of abnormal ALT levels, which were higher in individuals receiving valacyclovir compared to placebo (1.8% vs. 0.8%, respectively) during studies for the treatment of cold sores. Though this indication is for an elevation in liver enzymes rather than overt acute liver injury, enzyme elevations can be a hallmark of liver dysfunction and potential injury.

Regarding evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and valacyclovir, the drug label does not explicitly state that acute liver injury is not an adverse reaction. Given that liver enzyme abnormalities and hepatitis are noted, it cannot be concluded from the provided information that there is evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and valacyclovir. On the contrary, the information provided suggests that liver-related adverse effects occur, albeit at what may be a relatively low frequency.

Since the drug label does include liver-related issues within its postmarketing findings—it's important to note that these are adverse events reported voluntarily and a direct causal relationship to drug exposure is more challenging to confirm. No controlled clinical data is provided specifically refuting the presence of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to valacyclovir.

In summary, the evidence from the drug label does not refute the relationship between acute liver injury and valacyclovir; in fact, it suggests there is a possibility for liver-related adverse effects, including enzyme elevations and hepatitis, which have been reported in the postmarketing experience, albeit without enough data to establish a clear causal relationship. As with all medications, the reporting of adverse reactions is important for ongoing safety monitoring and assessment."
acute liver injury,valproate,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and valproate exposure includes clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, each documenting hepatotoxic effects associated with the use of valproate.

1. Clinical Trials:
   The adverse reactions section of the valproate labeling (section 5.1) states that ""hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate."" This section indicates that these events typically occurred within the first six months of treatment. Symptoms preceding liver failure included malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. The label emphasizes the importance of monitoring serum liver tests prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months.

2. Case Studies:
   Individual case studies, while not specified in detail within the label, contribute to the understanding of valproate-induced liver injury. Clinical case studies have historically been pivotal in illustrating the spectrum of valproate-induced hepatotoxicity, ranging from asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes to acute liver failure.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   In the post-marketing experience section (section 6.2), the labeling mentions that there have been reports of ""fatal hepatic failures."" Though these are based on voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, post-marketing data further support the link between valproate and acute liver injury, reinforcing the observations from clinical trials and case studies.

Risk Groups:
   The labeling points to higher risk populations which include children under the age of two, patients with mitochondrial disorders, those on multiple anticonvulsants, and patients with congenital metabolic disorders or severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation.

Mitochondrial Diseases:
   The labeling explicitly warns of the heightened risk of liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary mitochondrial diseases due to mutations in the POLG gene, such as Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome (sections 5.1 and Boxed Warning).

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance consistently points to a relationship between valproate and the potential for acute liver injury, which may range from mild hepatic dysfunction to fatal hepatic failure. The drug's label includes strong warnings about the risk of hepatotoxicity, particularly in children under two and in patients with certain genetic disorders or conditions. Monitoring liver function is a critical component of managing patients on valproate to mitigate this risk.","NA

The evidence provided, including the potential adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings associated with valproate, does indicate that acute liver injury/hepatotoxicity is an identified adverse reaction of valproate. Thus, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between valproate exposure and acute liver injury as this is a recognized risk of valproate use."
acute liver injury,valsartan,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as one of the most common adverse reactions to valsartan in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. In clinical trials involving patients with hypertension, heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction, the adverse reactions mentioned include headache, dizziness, viral infection, fatigue, abdominal pain, hypotension, diarrhea, arthralgia, back pain, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and renal impairment among others. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions were similar between the valsartan and placebo groups.

Specifically, under the ""Digestive"" subsection of postmarketing experience, elevated liver enzymes and very rare reports of hepatitis are mentioned. This could suggest that there have been instances where liver-related adverse effects, possibly including acute liver injury, have been observed following the use of valsartan. However, the frequency of these occurrences is not provided, and it is explicitly stated that because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Considering the information provided, acute liver injury is not indicated as a common adverse reaction to valsartan in clinical trial data but has been reported in the postmarketing experience as a rare event. The causal relationship between valsartan exposure and acute liver injury is not clearly established in the provided label sections. Without further detailed evidence from targeted studies or reports, it is not possible to conclusively determine or quantify the risk of acute liver injury due to valsartan. Additional analyses, such as case studies or a review of post-marketing surveillance data, would be necessary to better understand and evaluate the potential association between valsartan and acute liver injury.",NA
acute liver injury,vardenafil,,"Based on the provided drug label for vardenafil hydrochloride tablets, there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an observed adverse reaction in the sections detailing clinical studies or post-marketing experience. Adverse reactions that are reported occur at varying frequencies and include more common ones such as headache, flushing, nasal congestion, as well as others such as allergic reactions, chest pain, myocardial infarction, and visual disturbances among others. Digestive system-related adverse effects reported include nausea, gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, dry mouth, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, vomiting, and an increase in transaminases—a potential indicator of liver injury but not necessarily implicating acute liver injury.

The section titled ""5.8 Hepatic Impairment"" indicates that dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with moderate hepatic impairment and recommends not using the drug in patients with severe hepatic impairment. However, no specific evidence or rates of occurrence are provided that relate vardenafil to instances of acute liver injury.

In the absence of explicit data connecting vardenafil to acute liver injury within the clinical trial results, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance mentioned in the label, it cannot be conclusively stated that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction to vardenafil.

It's important to note, however, that the increase in transaminases reported could suggest potential liver-related effects, and this warrants careful monitoring and further clinical evaluation if such effects are suspected when patients are administered vardenafil.

For the most up-to-date and specific information regarding the adverse reactions of vardenafil related to liver function or injury, consulting the latest clinical literature and post-marketing surveillance reports, as well as communicating with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer, would be advisable.",NA
acute liver injury,varenicline,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction specifically associated with varenicline. The most commonly reported adverse reactions from clinical trials include nausea, abnormal dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting, with nausea being the most frequent and sometimes persistent over several months. The label also provides extensive detail on postmarketing reports of serious adverse reactions including neuropsychiatric events, seizures, accidental injuries, cardiovascular events, somnambulism, hypersensitivity reactions, and serious skin reactions.

The sections discussing postmarketing experience do list various disorders that have been reported, among which hepatobiliary disorders are mentioned, but this category is only followed by a single, rare report of ""gall bladder disorder"" without further detailing or specifically mentioning liver injury.

Moreover, the warnings and precautions section of the label emphasises neuropsychiatric adverse events, the interaction with alcohol, accidental injury, cardiovascular events, somnambulism, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions, serious skin reactions, and nausea, but does not provide a warning related to liver function or acute liver injury.

Clinical trials experience detailed in the label do not report liver injury as a common adverse event. In fact, liver function test abnormality is mentioned under the frequent class of reported adverse events in the investigations category, yet details are not given, and no connection is drawn between this and acute liver injury.

In the absence of explicit evidence or documented cases in the supplied material, it cannot be conclusively stated that acute liver injury is a known adverse reaction to varenicline. Clinical professionals rely on data from clinical trials, case reports, post-marketing surveillance, and pharmacovigilance to establish such links, and based on the provided sections of the drug label, a definitive relationship between varenicline and acute liver injury has not been established. If liver injury was a recognized adverse effect, it would likely be highlighted in the warnings and precautions section, which it is not.

Therefore, there is no known evidence within the provided drug label sections to support a relationship between acute liver injury and varenicline use. However, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse reactions to medications, which in turn helps to inform and update drug safety information.",NA
acute liver injury,vemurafenib,,"**Summary of Evidence for Acute Liver Injury Associated with Vemurafenib:**

Clinical Trials:
- In the clinical trial data provided (Trial 1 and Trial 2), vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor marketed as ZELBORAF, was associated with liver laboratory abnormalities in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Trial 1 compared vemurafenib to dacarbazine in treatment-naïve melanoma patients, while Trial 2 involved melanoma patients with prior systemic therapy failure. Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was more common in the vemurafenib group than dacarbazine in Trial 1 (11.5% vs. 8.6%). Other liver-related laboratory changes included increased alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). For instance, ALT increased to Grade 3 or 4 in 2.8% of the vemurafenib group in Trial 1.
- In Trial 4, which evaluated vemurafenib in patients with Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD), 9.1% of patients experienced Grade 3 ALT elevations, indicating a potential for acute liver injury.

Warnings and Precautions Related to Hepatotoxicity:
- The label indicates vemurafenib can lead to liver injury, including coagulopathy and organ dysfunction, as identified by liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. It advises monitoring these laboratory markers before initiation and monthly thereafter for hepatotoxicity. The label suggests dose reductions, treatment interruption, or discontinuation based on laboratory findings. 

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- While specific post-marketing data for acute liver injury are not detailed, the surveillance includes hepatotoxicity. This signals recognition of liver-related adverse reactions occurring after the drug entered the market. 

Conclusion:
There is evidence from clinical trials and the pharmacovigilance mechanisms regarding vemurafenib's potential to cause acute liver injury, with both laboratory data and clinical monitoring recommendations supporting this relationship. The mechanisms, presentation, and management of hepatotoxicity are outlined in the warnings and precautions section of the label, reaffirming the clinical relevance of this adverse reaction.",NA
acute liver injury,vemurafenib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and vemurafenib exposure can be summarized based on clinical trial data, post-marketing experience, and the labeling for vemurafenib (ZELBORAF), which includes Sections 5 (Warnings and Precautions) and 6 (Adverse Reactions) of the product label:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**:
   - **Trial 1**: This pivotal trial for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation compared vemurafenib to dacarbazine. In this study, liver laboratory abnormalities were monitored. Table 2 displays the incidence of worsening liver laboratory test results to Grade 3/4 levels as follows:
     - **Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)**: Increased to Grade 3/4 in 11.5% of vemurafenib-treated patients compared to 8.6% of dacarbazine-treated patients.
     - **Alanine transaminase (ALT)**: Elevated to Grade 3/4 in 2.8% of vemurafenib-treated patients compared to 1.9% of dacarbazine-treated patients.
     - No Grade 4 liver laboratory abnormalities for ALT, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin were reported in either treatment arm.
   - **Trial 4**: A trial studying vemurafenib in patients with Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD), a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Notably, ALT increased to Grade 3 in 9.1% of patients treated with vemurafenib.

2. **Postmarketing Experience**:
   - Postmarketing reports following the use of vemurafenib in a broader patient population corroborate that liver injury can occur. However, because these reports are voluntary and of uncertain size, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to vemurafenib exposure.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   - Section 5.6 of the label, titled ""Hepatotoxicity,"" explicitly states that liver injury resulting in functional hepatic impairment, including coagulopathy or other organ dysfunction, can occur with ZELBORAF (vemurafenib). Clinicians are advised to monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin before initiating treatment and to continue monitoring them monthly or as clinically indicated.

In conclusion, evidence from controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 4) provides a direct link between vemurafenib exposure and the potential for acute liver injury as manifested by increases in liver laboratory abnormalities. Additionally, post-marketing experience suggests the occurrence of liver injury, although these reports cannot definitively confirm causality. The product labeling (Warnings and Precautions, Section 5.6) also acknowledges hepatotoxicity as a risk of vemurafenib therapy, necessitating regular monitoring of liver function tests in patients being treated with the drug.",NA
acute liver injury,venlafaxine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for venlafaxine (an antidepressant), there is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as a commonly observed adverse reaction or as a part of the warnings or box warnings. The adverse reactions section details other side effects that led to treatment discontinuation and those commonly observed in clinical trials, such as nausea, sweating, dry mouth, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction among others.

The post-marketing reports section, which includes voluntary reports of adverse events temporally associated with venlafaxine after its market release, mentions ""hepatic events."" These include elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), abnormalities in liver function tests, liver damage, necrosis, or failure, and fatty liver. It's important to note that post-marketing reports do not necessarily establish a causal relationship with the drug, as these findings are not always scientifically validated.

While the label information does imply instances of liver-related adverse effects, the term 'acute liver injury' is not specifically used. Additionally, post-marketing reports are less controlled than clinical trial data and can be influenced by various biases. Therefore, while there may be some indications of venlafaxine-associated hepatic events in these reports, stronger, more definitive evidence from clinical trials or observational studies would be required to establish a direct causative relationship between venlafaxine and acute liver injury.

In summary, according to the provided drug label information, acute liver injury is not explicitly documented as an adverse reaction of venlafaxine from clinical trials or controlled studies. However, hepatic events have been reported in the post-marketing experience, indicating a need for further investigation to clarify this potential relationship.",NA
acute liver injury,verapamil,,"Acute liver injury as a potential adverse reaction to verapamil is not explicitly listed in the provided drug label sections for controlled U.S. clinical trials involving 324 patients. The reactions reported include cardiovascular issues (e.g., symptomatic hypotension, bradycardia, severe tachycardia), central nervous system effects (e.g., dizziness, headache, and rare cases of seizures), gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, abdominal discomfort), and rare instances of hypersensitivity (e.g., broncho/laryngeal spasm, itch, urticaria). Additional reactions reported at low frequency include emotional depression, rotary nysagmus, sleep, vertigo, muscle fatigue, diaphoresis, and respiratory failure.

The absence of acute liver injury from this provided list suggests that either it was not observed in the mentioned clinical trials or it occurred at a frequency less than the reporting threshold. However, it's important to note that the list is not exhaustive and may not include all possible side effects. Post-marketing surveillance might provide additional information as it encompasses a broader patient population and a longer period of drug exposure, which can reveal rarer or longer-term adverse effects not seen in clinical trials.

If acute liver injury is suspected to be related to verapamil, the information might be found in dedicated hepatotoxicity registries, case reports, pharmacovigilance databases, or further clinical studies focused on drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Case studies serve as important sources for identifying and characterizing such rare adverse effects. However, with the information provided, there is no evidence from the clinical trial data of verapamil causing acute liver injury.

Therefore, to fully evaluate the relationship between verapamil and acute liver injury, one would have to review external sources such as case studies, registry data for drug-induced liver injury, and reports from pharmacovigilance programs. Without this additional information, the summary based on the provided sections is that acute liver injury is not a reported adverse reaction from the controlled U.S. clinical trials involving 324 patients taking verapamil hydrochloride injection.",NA
acute liver injury,vilobelimab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for GOHIBIC, there is mention of ""Hepatic enzyme increased"" noted in 5.1% of patients treated with GOHIBIC (vilobelimab) compared to 3.7% in the placebo group during the Phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial known as PANAMO. This information suggests that there is at least some evidence for an association between vilobelimab and increased hepatic enzymes, which can be indicative of acute liver injury.

The analysis included 175 patients who received at least one dose of vilobelimab and 189 who received a placebo. While hepatic enzyme increase is not precisely the same as acute liver injury, it is often considered a surrogate marker for potential liver damage and thus could suggest a higher occurrence of hepatic-related adverse reactions in patients receiving the drug.

No specific mention of acute liver injury as a discrete adverse event was provided in the sections given. Furthermore, there is no detailed severity or outcomes data related to the elevated hepatic enzymes included, whether or not these abnormalities were transient or led to more severe liver injury, or additional characterization that might establish a more direct link between the drug exposure and acute liver injury.

Other serious adverse events and infections are noted in the label, but there is no direct mention of acute liver injury or a detailed evaluation of its relationship to the use of vilobelimab beyond the increased hepatic enzymes report.

Therefore, while there is a potential association implied by the increased incidence of hepatic enzyme elevations in the vilobelimab arm, the evidence provided does not specifically confirm acute liver injury as an adverse reaction attributable to vilobelimab. There is no mention of acute liver injury in the post-marketing surveillance, and no box warnings are provided that indicate acute liver injury as a recognized significant risk. Additional investigation and detailed safety data would be required to definitively evaluate the relationship between acute liver injury and vilobelimab exposure.","Based on the information provided from the clinical trial data on the drug GOHIBIC (vilobelimab) included in the adverse reactions and warnings sections of the drug label, there is no mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction in the observed clinical trial. The most common adverse reactions reported are pneumonia, sepsis, delirium, pulmonary embolism, hypertension, and others, but acute liver injury is not listed among them.

It should be noted that ""Hepatic enzyme increased"" is mentioned, with an incidence of 5.1% in the GOHIBIC-treated group versus 3.7% in the placebo group. While this could potentially indicate a hepatic-related side effect, ""acute liver injury"" specifically is not referenced. Increased hepatic enzymes could suggest some form of liver stress or damage; however, this is not definitive proof of acute liver injury and does not fully characterize the nature or severity of the hepatic event.

In the absence of clear evidence or data explicitly stating acute liver injury as an adverse reaction of vilobelimab, and considering that this particular adverse reaction is not detailed in the sections provided from the drug's label, we can infer that there is no direct evidence refuting or supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and vilobelimab in the information given.

However, it's important to acknowledge that serious and unexpected adverse events may still occur that have not been previously reported with GOHIBIC use (as indicated in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section), which leaves the possibility open that such an adverse event could be identified in the future with broader use of the drug in clinical practice or additional studies. For a definitive conclusion, continuous post-marketing surveillance and further research would be necessary to determine if there is any association between acute liver injury and vilobelimab use."
acute liver injury,vipivotide tetraxetan,,"Based on the provided drug label for vipivotide tetraxetan (PLUVICTO), the evidence of an association between PLUVICTO and acute liver injury is as follows:

Within the safety evaluation documented in the VISION study, which included patients with progressive, PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.8% of patients receiving vipivotide tetraxetan plus best standard of care (BSoC). Among these fatal adverse reactions, hepatic failure was reported in 0.4% of the patients. This indicates that there is a recognized, though infrequent, risk of acute liver injury in the form of hepatic failure associated with the administration of vipivotide tetraxetan.

However, the provided label sections do not specify the number of patients who might have experienced non-fatal acute liver injury, nor do they present data indicating the severity or reversibility of these hepatic effects. Furthermore, the relationship between these observed hepatic failures and other factors such as pre-existing liver conditions, concomitant medications, or progression of the underlying mCRPC is not detailed in the provided text.

It is also worth mentioning that increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were observed worsening from baseline in 28% of the patients on PLUVICTO plus BSoC, with 1.1% experiencing Grade 3 or 4 elevations. While elevated AST alone is not a definitive indicator of acute liver injury, it may suggest hepatocellular damage when interpreted alongside other clinical findings.

To note, this summary is limited to the information from the provided drug label sections, which may not encompass all existing evidence or the most current post-marketing surveillance data. It is advisable to consult additional post-marketing reports and the latest clinical literature for a comprehensive overview of the safety profile of vipivotide tetraxetan, including its potential to cause acute liver injury.","Based on the provided drug label sections regarding vipivotide tetraxetan (PLUVICTO), there is no mention of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions listed in the label include myelosuppression, renal toxicity, general disorders like fatigue and decreased appetite, gastrointestinal disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, among others. The laboratory abnormalities reported are related to decreased blood counts and changes in electrolytes, not specifically to liver function tests. 

It is stated that serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients, with fatal adverse reactions in 2.8% of patients, including hepatic failure in 0.4% of patients. While ""hepatic failure"" could potentially be construed as a severe form of liver injury, it is not explicitly categorized as ""acute liver injury"" in the provided data. Furthermore, the 0.4% incidence could also be interpreted as a rare and not necessarily a common side effect of the medication. 

However, this does not conclusively refute the possibility that acute liver injury could be an adverse effect of vipivotide tetraxetan since there is a mention of hepatic failure albeit at a low incidence. Furthermore, if liver injury was not a focus of the provided clinical trial or post-marketing safety data, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Thus, while explicit evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and vipivotide tetraxetan use is not provided, data indicating it as a common or well-characterized adverse reaction is also lacking. 

For a full assessment, other sources outside this label such as peer-reviewed studies, additional clinical trials, or a comprehensive analysis of post-marketing data would be required to confirm the relationship or lack thereof between acute liver injury and the drug. As of the information provided, no firm conclusion can be drawn regarding the relationship between acute liver injury and vipivotide tetraxetan."
acute liver injury,vismodegib,,"Acute liver injury has been identified as a potential adverse reaction during the post-marketing surveillance of vismodegib, marketed under the brand name ERIVEDGE. Specifically, under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" of the drug label, hepatobiliary disorders including drug-induced liver injury have been reported. These post-approval adverse reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, and causal relationships to drug exposure can be challenging to ascertain definitively due to this reporting mechanism.

It is important to note that the label does not provide specific data on the frequency of acute liver injury or detailed clinical characteristics of the reported cases. Furthermore, an extensive incidence rate could not be established due to the nature of voluntary reporting systems, which typically underreport the actual incidence of adverse drug reactions.

Additionally, there is no explicit mention of acute liver incidence in the summary of clinical trials provided in the drug label. Hence, the identified relationship primarily stems from real-world usage data rather than from initial clinical trial observations. Such post-marketing findings could reflect a broader population with varying health statuses, drug interactions, or co-morbidities not necessarily present in the clinical trial environment.

In conclusion, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and vismodegib comes solely from post-marketing surveillance data, as explicitly stated in the product's drug label, and further surveillance and research may be necessary to define the incidence rate and risk factors associated with this adverse reaction.","NA

acute liver injury,vismodegib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury and exposure to vismodegib, marketed as ERIVEDGE, can be primarily derived from post-marketing surveillance data, as this adverse reaction has been identified during the post-approval use of the drug. According to the provided drug label sections, hepatobiliary disorders, specifically drug-induced liver injury, have been reported among the postmarketing experiences for ERIVEDGE. Since these reports come from voluntary submissions from a population of uncertain size after the drug has been approved and released to the market, it is challenging to estimate their exact frequency or to establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

Clinical trial data does not appear to list acute liver injury as a commonly observed adverse reaction in the studied populations. During clinical trials (reflected in the safety data section 6.1 of the label), a variety of adverse reactions were observed in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who received ERIVEDGE at doses ≥ 150 mg orally daily. The trials cited included SHH3925g, SHH4437g, SHH4476g, and SHH4610g, involving 138 patients. The adverse reactions mentioned prominently include muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, weight loss, and fatigue, among others. However, acute liver injury is not listed in this section of the label.

The label does include laboratory abnormalities observed during clinical trials but makes no specific mention of liver function abnormalities, focusing instead on observations of hyponatremia (low sodium), azotemia (high blood nitrogen), and hypokalemia (low potassium).

In conclusion, although acute liver injury is not frequently reported in clinical trial data available for ERIVEDGE, it has been identified during post-marketing surveillance as a potential adverse reaction related to the drug. Due to the nature of postmarketing reports, which are voluntary and come from a large, unspecific population, the determination of a causal link between vismodegib and acute liver injury would require further investigation, such as well-designed observational studies or case series, to understand the incidence and mechanisms involved.",NA
acute liver injury,voriconazole,1.0,"Acute liver injury has been documented as a potential adverse reaction to voriconazole, which is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections.

**Evidence from Clinical Trials:**
In clinical trials, hepatic toxicity, including serious cases such as clinical hepatitis, cholestasis, and fulminant hepatic failure, some leading to fatalities, has been reported (section 5.1 of the drug label). It is noted that hepatic reactions occurred primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. Transaminase levels and bilirubin were monitored at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and regularly during treatment. A subset of these reactions was seen within the pediatric population.

The incidence of transaminase increases greater than three times the upper limit of normal was 17.7% among adult subjects in therapeutic clinical trials of voriconazole (section 6.1 of the drug label). Elevated liver enzymes and other hepatic-related laboratory abnormalities were also observed in pediatric patients (section 6.1 of the drug label).

**Evidence from Post-marketing Surveillance:**
Post-marketing experience corroborates the clinical trial data, with hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, among patients with no other identifiable risk factors reported (section 5.1 of the drug label). Additionally, some cases of liver dysfunction were reversible upon discontinuation of voriconazole.

**Evaluation and Monitoring:**
Liver function tests are recommended at the start of therapy and then at least weekly for the first month. If significant liver function abnormalities develop, it is recommended to discontinue voriconazole. Specifically, serum transaminase levels and bilirubin are to be monitored, and if liver function tests become elevated compared to baseline, discontinuation of voriconazole should be considered (sections 5.1 and 5.10 of the drug label).

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance that acute liver injury is a potential adverse reaction to voriconazole. Monitoring of liver function is recommended during voriconazole therapy to manage this risk. The provided drug label sections offer significant support for the relationship between voriconazole exposure and potential hepatic toxicity.",NA
acute liver injury,warfarin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, acute liver injury is not explicitly listed as a labeled adverse reaction to warfarin. However, the label does mention 'hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes' under section 6 'Other adverse reactions to warfarin sodium'. This indicates that some level of liver dysfunction, such as hepatitis and elevation of liver enzymes, has been associated with the use of warfarin.

Cholestatic hepatitis is noted to have an association with concurrent use of warfarin and ticlopidine, which is cited under the same section. This specific interaction suggests that warfarin can contribute to hepatic disorders when used in combination with certain other medications.

The available evidence, as presented in the drug label, does not detail the frequency or the definitive causality of acute liver injury specifically due to warfarin sodium alone. Moreover, the information does not mention acute liver injury occurring in clinical trials or provide specific post-marketing surveillance data for this particular adverse event.

In summary, while the drug label mentions hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes as potential adverse reactions to warfarin, it does not provide clear evidence of a direct causal relationship between warfarin exposure and acute liver injury as a standalone adverse reaction. No specific supporting evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data regarding acute liver injury solely due to warfarin exposure is provided in the excerpts supplied.",NA
acute liver injury,zafirlukast,1.0,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to support the relationship between acute liver injury and the exposure to zafirlukast, particularly from post-marketing surveillance and clinical trial observations.

In clinical trials, there have been rare instances of liver enzyme elevations in patients taking zafirlukast. These elevations were more commonly observed at doses four times higher than the recommended dose. This suggests a dose-dependent relationship between zafirlukast and liver enzyme elevation.

Furthermore, post-marketing adverse event surveillance has revealed cases of symptomatic hepatitis and hyperbilirubinemia without other attributable causes in patients who have been administered the recommended dose of zafirlukast (40 mg/day). While these instances are rare, there have been reports where patients developed fulminant hepatitis, progressed to hepatic failure, required liver transplantation, and even resulted in death. In most cases, symptoms abated and liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after discontinuation of zafirlukast.

No specific percentage of incidence is provided regarding acute liver injury; however, given that hepatic events have been documented both in clinical trial settings and post-marketing surveillance, there is evidence to establish a causal association between zafirlukast and acute liver injury. It should be noted that while the relationship exists, the incidence appears to be rare.

Physicians are advised to monitor liver function when prescribing zafirlukast and to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction, as mentioned in the drug label's warnings and precautions sections. Patients should also be informed about the signs of hepatic toxicity and advised to seek medical attention should they experience symptoms suggestive of liver injury.

This summary is based on information provided from the drug label, which is a regulated and reliable source. Additional studies or case reports not mentioned in the drug label could provide further insights into the relationship between zaffirlukast and acute liver injury.","Based on the information provided from the drug label sections you have cited, there is evidence of a possible connection between zafirlukast and hepatic adverse events, including acute liver injury. The label mentions that in controlled clinical trials, elevations of liver enzymes were observed, particularly at doses four times higher than the recommended dose. Additionally, postmarketing adverse event surveillance has reported cases of symptomatic hepatitis, and in rare cases, patients progressed to hepatic failure, necessitating liver transplantation and, in some instances, resulting in death.

The label specifically cites cases of symptomatic hepatitis (with or without hyperbilirubinemia) without other identifiable causes and mentions that in most (but not all) cases, liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after discontinuation of zafirlukast.

Given the information available in the drug label, it cannot be said that evidence refutes the relationship between acute liver injury and zafirlukast. In fact, the evidence, as mentioned in clinical trials data and postmarketing surveillance, supports the possibility of such a relationship, although these events may be rare.

Therefore, the response to your request regarding summarizing evidence refuting the relationship between acute liver injury and zafirlukast is NA, as current evidence does not refute this relationship but rather suggests that a potential link exists."
acute liver injury,zaleplon,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label of zaleplon, acute liver injury does not appear to be listed as a recognized adverse reaction from the premarketing clinical trial data or post-marketing reports for this medication. In the sections provided, which detail adverse reactions and warnings including postmarketing reports, there is no direct mention of acute liver injury as a known adverse event associated with the use of zaleplon.

The provided sections of the drug label discuss various adverse events and reactions that have been observed both in clinical trials and during the post-marketing period. These include gastrointestinal disturbances (like nausea), nervous system effects (such as amnesia, dizziness, somnolence), dermal reactions (like pruritus, rash), and a range of other potential side effects. Additionally, certain severe reactions such as anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions are mentioned in postmarketing reports. However, there is no specification of acute liver injury in the text provided.

Moreover, liver-related adverse effects mentioned in the label are limited to rare occurrences of abnormal liver function tests, increased AST (SGOT), and ALT (SGPT) levels, which are nonspecific and do not necessarily indicate acute liver injury. These laboratory findings could be associated with liver injury or could have other explanations.

To summarize, there is no evidence in the provided drug label sections to support the relationship between acute liver injury and zaleplon use. For a conclusive statement, it would be advisable to consult the entire drug label, conduct a comprehensive literature review, and analyze data from various sources such as clinical trial databases, pharmacovigilance data, and case reports specifically investigating the association between zaleplon and acute liver injury. If any new evidence has emerged after the knowledge cutoff date, it should be reviewed to update the safety profile of the drug.",NA
acute liver injury,zidovudine,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and zidovudine exposure can be found in sections of the drug label detailing adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experiences. While there is no explicit mention of ""acute liver injury"" in the provided sections of the drug label, there are several indications of liver-related adverse effects that could encompass acute liver injury.

Clinical Trials:
- Hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and anemia, is emphasized along with symptomatic myopathy and lactic acidosis, and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis is highlighted as potentially severe adverse reactions (Section 6).
- In adults with more advanced HIV infection at the time of therapy initiation, the rates of adverse reactions are higher (Section 6.1).
- Hyperbilirubinemia is documented at an incidence of less than or equal to 0.8% in certain clinical trials (Section 6.1).
- For pediatric patients in one of the trials (ACTG 300), hepatomegaly is reported as an observed adverse reaction at an 11% occurrence rate (Section 6.1).

Boxed Warnings and Precautions:
- Severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and lactic acidosis are noted as potentially fatal adverse reactions when using zidovudine and other nucleoside analogues, with a need to suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggest lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (Boxed Warning; Sections 5.4).
- The labels advise caution in administering zidovudine to patients with hepatomegaly and steatosis and recommend halting treatment if there are signs of significant hepatotoxicity (Section 5.4).

Post-Marketing Experience:
- Post-marketing surveillance has revealed instances of hepatomegaly with steatosis, hepatitis, jaundice, lactic acidosis, and pancreatitis (Section 6.2). These conditions may be indicative of, or contribute to, acute liver injury, although such terms are broad and could encompass varying severities and mechanisms of liver damage.

Despite these reported adverse reactions related to liver function and health, the term ""acute liver injury"" specifically is not detailed in the summary provided. It's important to recognize that liver-related adverse effects can range from mild elevations in liver enzymes to severe, life-threatening conditions like hepatic failure. However, the evidence documented in the product labeling regarding hepatomegaly with steatosis, hepatitis, and lactic acidosis indicates that zidovudine does have potential hepatotoxic effects, which may include, or be consistent with, acute liver injury scenarios. 

In summary, while the provided drug label excerpts do not directly reference ""acute liver injury"" as a distinct adverse reaction to zidovudine, there is substantial documentation of serious liver-related adverse reactions associated with the drug's use, which supports a relationship between zidovudine exposure and the potential for hepatic adverse events. This evidence is derived from the drug's boxed warnings, clinical trials, and reported post-marketing experiences.",NA
acute liver injury,zileuton,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute liver injury (hepatotoxicity) and exposure to zileuton extended-release tablets comes from several sources, including clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the drug label's adverse reactions and warning sections.

Clinical Trial Evidence:

- Short-Term Clinical Studies: A 12-week placebo-controlled trial involving 199 patients receiving zileuton indicated an incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations (≥3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) of 2.5% in the zileuton group, compared to 0.5% in the placebo group. These ALT elevations appeared predominantly within the first month of treatment and resolved within 9 to 31 days after discontinuation of zileuton in most cases.
  
- Long-Term Clinical Studies: A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults and adolescents with asthma showed similar rates and types of adverse reactions as the 12-week study, with ALT elevations (≥3×ULN) observed in 1.8% of patients treated with zileuton compared to 0.7% with placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within the first 3 months, and most resolved within 21 days after drug discontinuation.

Postmarketing Experience:

- Following approval, zileuton immediate-release tablets (which contain the same active ingredient as the extended-release formulation) have been associated with cases of severe hepatic injury, including death, life-threatening liver injury with recovery, symptomatic jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevations of ALT greater than 8 times ULN. While these cases are voluntarily reported and the frequency is uncertain, they suggest a potential for serious liver injury with zileuton use.

Drug Label Warnings:

- The drug label for zileuton extended-release tablets includes specific warnings about hepatotoxicity, advising clinicians to monitor liver enzymes before and during treatment. It highlights the potential for laboratory abnormalities to progress to clinically significant liver injury or resolve during continued treatment.

Overall, the evidence clearly indicates that acute liver injury is indeed an adverse reaction associated with zileuton. This is reflected in clinical trial results that show a greater incidence of liver enzyme elevations with zileuton than with placebo, warnings in the drug label about hepatotoxicity, and post-marketing reports of severe hepatic injury.

acute myocardial infarction,17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone,,"Based on the information provided in the drug label, there is evidence indicating that there is a potential relationship between the use of progestins, including 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and serious arterial thrombotic and venous thromboembolic events. This category includes myocardial infarction, as noted in section A of the reported adverse reactions. The label lists myocardial infarction as an adverse event that has been reported in women using progestins.

While the label mentions myocardial infarction as one of the serious adverse reactions, it does not provide specific details on the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data that led to this inclusion. Drug labels commonly reflect findings that have been identified during the drug's development, which may include pre-approval clinical trials and/or post-marketing surveillance that captures rare adverse events not seen in clinical trials due to their larger and more varied populations.

To fully assess the strength of the evidence supporting the relationship between 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and acute myocardial infarction, it would be beneficial to consult the original clinical trial data, any available case studies, and detailed post-marketing surveillance reports. These sources would provide insights into the frequency of such adverse reactions, the context in which they occurred, risk factors potentially influencing the events, and any confirmed causal links identified through research.

As the detailed source data from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance is not provided here, it is not possible to critically evaluate the level and quality of evidence associating 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone with myocardial infarction. For precise information, the original research articles, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database, and the manufacturer's detailed reports would need to be reviewed.

In summary, the drug label for 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone does cite myocardial infarction as a reported serious adverse reaction in the context of progestin use, implying a potential relationship between the drug exposure and this adverse event. The absence of detailed evidence precludes a more in-depth analysis, and further investigation into original sources is recommended for those seeking a detailed understanding of the evidence.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,abacavir,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (MI) and abacavir exposure is observed in several prospective, observational epidemiological studies that have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of MI. These observational studies suggest that there may be a correlation between abacavir treatment and increased risk of MI.

However, further investigation through meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials has not shown this association, with observations indicating no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects when compared to control subjects. This suggests that the evidence from clinical trials does not support the association between abacavir exposure and increased risk of MI, contrasting with observations from epidemiological studies.

The discrepancy between the observational studies and the clinical trial data means that there is inconsistency in the available evidence. Consequently, a definitive causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI remains inconclusive. Despite this inconclusiveness, it is recommended as a precaution to consider the underlying risk of coronary heart disease when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and take measures to minimize modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking.

The source of this evidence comes from the details within the drug label specific to section 5.4 ""Myocardial Infarction"" which outlines the findings from epidemiological studies and clinical trials. It is important to assess post-marketing surveillance data as well for a more comprehensive understanding of the drug's safety profile, but no specific post-marketing data regarding MI is referenced in the provided label sections.

In summary, although observational studies suggest a potential association between abacavir and MI, controlled clinical trials have not confirmed this association, leading to inconclusive evidence about a causal relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,abemaciclib,,"The label for abemaciclib (Verzenio) reports that myocardial infarction is one of the events leading to fatality in a small percentage (0.03%) of patients treated with abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) during the monarchE study. This clinical trial involved adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast amazing at high risk of recurrence.

In the safety evaluation of the monarchE study consisting of 5,591 adult patients, the severe adverse reactions that resulted in death included myocardial infarction among several others. Each of these events accounted for 0.03% of the fatalities in patients receiving the combination of abemaciclib with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.

Regarding post-marketing experience, while myocardial infarction is not listed specifically, it should be noted that the post-marketing data may not be comprehensive as these incidents are voluntarily reported and the estimates of frequency can be uncertain.

Since myocardial infarction is not listed as a common adverse reaction (incidence ≥20%), it can be inferred that while there is a recognized potential risk of myocardial infarction, this severe adverse event is rare. The evidence from the monarchE trial has supported this observed relationship albeit with a very low incidence rate. Continuous post-marketing surveillance and reporting are important for the ongoing assessment of drug-related adverse events like myocardial infarction with abemaciclib therapy. 

It is critical for healthcare providers to monitor patients for signs of cardiac events and provide appropriate clinical management according to the observed toxicities as outlined in the warnings and precautions of the abemaciclib label.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,abiraterone,,"The clinical trial data presented in the sections you provided suggests that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or heart attack was not a commonly reported adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trials of abiraterone, which included COU-AA-301, COU-AA-302, and LATITUDE.

In the COU-AA-301 trial, myocardial infarction or ischemia actually occurred more commonly in the placebo arm than in the abiraterone acetate arm (1.3% vs. 1.1% respectively). Furthermore, in the combined data from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies mentioned in the cardiovascular adverse reactions subsection, myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in an equal number of patients in the placebo arms and abiraterone acetate arms (3 deaths each).

It's important to note that while the data suggests that AMI was not a frequently observed event in the treatment arm relative to the placebo, the risk of cardiovascular events overall, such as cardiac failure and arrhythmia, was increased in the abiraterone acetate-treated patients. Specifically, cardiac failure occurred more commonly in patients on the abiraterone acetate arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.6% versus 0.9%), with grade 3-4 cardiac failure occurring in 1.3% of patients taking abiraterone acetate versus 0.2% of patients taking placebo.

Postmarketing experience identified QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes in patients who developed hypokalemia or had underlying cardiovascular conditions but did not specifically mention AMI. It is relevant to consider that abiraterone can cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a result of increased mineralocorticoid levels due to CYP17 inhibition, which may indirectly contribute to the risk of cardiac events.

In summary, there is no direct evidence from the provided clinical trials that acute myocardial infarction is a common adverse reaction of abiraterone, and it was actually reported slightly more frequently in the placebo group in one of the trials. However, increased cardiovascular events overall were seen, potentially implicating a broader category of cardiac risk that might include AMI, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The safest approach to prescribing abiraterone would include a careful assessment and management of cardiovascular risks in individual patients.

Please note that all the information provided here is based on the case studies, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance data available as of my last update. As always in medicine, new research could provide more insights, so it is important to review the most current available information when considering medication risks and benefits.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,abiraterone,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is not a direct indication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction to abiraterone (marketed as ZYTIGA). However, cardiovascular adverse reactions, such as hypertension, fluid retention, and hypokalemia due to mineralocorticoid excess, have been associated with the use of abiraterone, which could theoretically contribute to cardiovascular risks.

The sections provided detail the experience from clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, and the evidence suggests the following points related to cardiovascular adverse events:

1. Clinical Trial Experience (Section 6.1):
   - In the COU-AA-301 trial table, chest pain or chest discomfort was experienced by 3.8% of patients on abiraterone and 2.8% on placebo. However, myocardial infarction or ischemia occurred more commonly in the placebo arm than in the ZYTIGA arm (1.3% vs. 1.1% respectively), suggesting that abiraterone is not necessarily associated with higher risks of myocardial infarction compared to placebo.

2. Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions (Within Section 6.1):
   - Cardiac failure occurred more commonly in patients on the abiraterone arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (2.6% versus 0.9%), with Grade 3-4 cardiac failure occurring in 1.3% of patients taking abiraterone. While cardiac failure is not the same as AMI, it is considered a serious cardiovascular event.
   - Arrhythmias were generally Grade 1 or 2, with some serious cases including one death associated with arrhythmia, three patients with sudden death in the abiraterone arms, and five deaths in the placebo arms.

3. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
   - There are mentions of cardiac disorders such as QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes observed in patients who developed hypokalemia or had underlying cardiovascular conditions. While these are serious cardiac events, specific incidence rates of AMI are not reported.

4. Warnings and Precautions (Section 5):
   - Section 5.1 warns of the potential for mineralocorticoid excess with abiraterone, which can lead to hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention; all potentially exacerbating factors for cardiovascular risks. It advises close monitoring, particularly in patients with heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, or ventricular arrhythmia.

In summary, the direct evidence linking abiraterone to acute myocardial infarction is not strongly supported by the provided clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance. However, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including hypertension, hypokalemia, fluid retention, and cardiac failure, have been observed. These effects could contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular events including AMI, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Health care providers should monitor patients closely for signs of cardiac adverse reactions and manage any emerging risks according to clinical judgment and the recommendations in the label.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,acamprosate,,"The provided drug label information for acamprosate does not show any direct evidence linking acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction to the medication. Acamprosate's adverse reactions listed under section 6.1, which are at a rate of 3% or greater and more frequent than placebo, include accidental injury, asthenia, pain, anorexia, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, anxiety, depression, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, paresthesia, pruritus and sweating.

However, under section 6, where events observed during the premarketing evaluation of acamprosate are listed, myocardial infarction is mentioned as an ""infrequent"" adverse reaction, meaning it occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. This suggests that while there may be rare cases where AMI has been temporally associated with the use of acamprosate, it is not recognized as a common adverse reaction.

It is also important to note that this section of the label does not establish a definitive causal relationship between acamprosate exposure and myocardial infarction, merely that it has been reported among a small number of patients. The postmarketing experience (section 6.2) does not mention AMI among the adverse reactions identified.

Given the information available, one can infer that acute myocardial infarction is a potential, but infrequent, adverse reaction to acamprosate. The evidence does not suggest it is common or a significant risk for the majority of patients taking the medication. Moreover, the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain due to the low incidence rate and the lack of a clear established causal relationship. As always, healthcare providers should monitor patients for any adverse events and report novel or serious events to the appropriate regulatory agencies.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,acitretin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for acitretin, the evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acitretin exposure is limited and mainly derives from post-marketing surveillance data. Here is a summary of the relevant details:

**Clinical Trials:**
During the clinical trials of 525 subjects with psoriasis, which involved the administration of acitretin, one subject died due to an acute myocardial infarction. This event was considered remotely related to drug therapy. This suggests that while an instance of AMI was observed during the trials, it was not clearly established as a side effect caused by the drug.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
After the approval of acitretin, adverse events such as acute myocardial infarction have been reported during post-approval use. However, these reports come from voluntary submissions, which makes it difficult to estimate the frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure reliably. As these events are infrequent and lack robust causality assessment, they do not provide strong evidence of a relationship between acitretin and AMI.

**Causal Relationship:**
The drug label notes that for post-marketing reports, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. This makes it challenging to definitively state that acitretin exposure causes AMI based on the available data.

In summary, while there is a mention of acute myocardial infarction in the context of adverse events potentially related to acitretin, the evidence does not definitively establish a causal relationship. The available data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance lacks the strength and consistency required to confirm AMI as an adverse reaction of acitretin. To establish a more concrete connection, further research, including more extensive clinical studies and well-documented case reports, would be necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,adalimumab,,"The provided drug label for adalimumab (e.g., AMJEVITA) includes detailed information on various adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, post-marketing experiences, and specific warnings and precautions. However, it does not directly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction. Nevertheless, under the section ""Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies"" within the label, it is noted that ""myocardial infarct"" was among the serious adverse reactions that occurred infrequently (less than 5% of patients) in adalimumab-treated patients in these studies.

This implies that there have been instances where patients treated with adalimumab in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis experienced myocardial infarctions. However, the incidence of this event appears to be relatively low, and the drug label does not specify the exact number of cases or whether the relationship between adalimumab and AMI was deemed causal.

When assessing causality, it is crucial to consider the overall clinical context, including the patient populations being treated (who may have underlying risk factors for heart disease), the nature of the reported adverse events, and any established mechanisms whereby the drug might feasentially contribute to the adverse event. Given that adalimumab is an immunomodulatory drug, the mechanisms by which it may potentially contribute to cardiovascular events like AMI are not entirely clear but could relate to changes in systemic inflammation, which is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.

It is important to note that post-marketing surveillance often uncovers a broader range of adverse effects than those detected in clinical trials due to larger and more diverse patient populations being exposed to the drug. Therefore, reports from this surveillance should be taken into consideration to form a more complete picture of the drug's safety profile.

To summarize, while myocardial infarction is not prominently featured in the drug label sections provided for adalimumab, it has been listed as a less common adverse reaction in rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies. Further information, preferably from large-scale epidemiological studies or a comprehensive analysis of post-marketing surveillance data, would be necessary to better elucidate the relationship between adalimumab use and the risk of acute myocardial infarction. As such, healthcare providers should remain vigilant regarding this potential risk when prescribing adalimumab and consider the individual cardiovascular risk profile of their patients.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,adenosine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and adenosine exposure cannot be directly established, as AMI is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions in either the controlled clinical trials or the post-marketing experience.

The adverse reactions listed from the controlled U.S. clinical trials include cardiovascular effects such as facial flushing, palpitations, chest pain, and hypotension, but these are not synonymous with AMI. While chest pain is a symptom that can be associated with AMI, it is a nonspecific symptom and can be related to other, non-cardiac causes.

The post-marketing experience mentions serious cardiovascular events such as prolonged asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and Torsade de Pointes. Although these are significant adverse cardiovascular outcomes, they are distinct from AMI.

In the absence of AMI being explicitly reported in the adverse reactions or post-marketing surveillance, and without additional evidence from case studies or other scientific literature specifically linking adenosine with acute myocardial infarction, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no known direct evidence to support acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of adenosine based on the provided information. 

It should be noted that adverse events, particularly in post-marketing surveillance, are reported voluntarily and the population size is uncertain. Therefore, the absence of reported AMI events does not definitively rule out the possibility but indicates that it has not been frequently observed or conclusively linked to adenosine at the time of the label's publication.

For a complete assessment, a thorough examination of the scientific literature, including peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and clinical trial data not included in the drug label, would be necessary to identify any rare or less commonly reported incidents of AMI associated with adenosine. As of the knowledge cutoff, if such literature existed, it would be equally important to review it to understand the overall evidence supporting this relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,agalsidase beta,,"The evidence supporting a potential relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of agalsidase beta (commercially known as Fabrazyme) is derived from postmarketing experience, as specified in section 6.3 of the drug label. During the postapproval use of Fabrazyme, myocardial infarction has been identified as an adverse reaction. However, because these reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, it can be challenging to accurately determine the frequency of these events or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

According to the provided label sections, the clinical trials experience (section 6.1) conducted with Fabrazyme does not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction. In these trials, adverse reactions such as infusion-associated reactions and various others (upper respiratory tract infection, chills, pyrexia, headache, cough, etc.) were noted, but AMI was not listed among them.

Immunogenicity (section 6.2) refers to the body's immune response to the administered therapeutic protein, which can manifest as the production of antibodies. This section reports the incidence of antibody formation in treated patients, indicating that some developed neutralizing antibodies impacting the drug's activity. However, there is no direct mention of AMI in relation to immunogenicity.

The Warnings and Precautions sections (5.1 and 5.2) detail risks associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and infusion-associated reactions, but do not discuss AMI.

In summary, the evidence of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to Fabrazyme comes solely from postmarketing surveillance data, as mentioned in section 6.3 of the drug label. Due to the nature of voluntary reporting in a postmarketing context, establishing a causal relationship is challenging, and there is no quantifiable incidence rate provided.

For a definitive conclusion, further studies, including controlled clinical trials or observational studies with more robust adverse event reporting, would be necessary to clarify the relationship between agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) and the risk of acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,aldesleukin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and aldesleukin (Proleukin) treatment is derived from clinical trial experiences, postmarketing reports, and the drug's known pharmacodynamic profile. Aldesleukin is an interleukin-2 (IL-2) product used mainly to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma. 

Clinical Trials Experience:
- In the clinical trials section (6.1) of the provided drug label, AMI is mentioned as a less common (Grade 4) cardiac disorder, with a frequency of <1% among the 525 patients treated with Proleukin for metastatic renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma.

Other Clinical Trial Experience:
- In a broader population of more than 1,800 patients treated with various Proleukin-based regimens for RCC, melanoma, or other cancers, myocardial infarction is listed as a fatal event that occurred with a frequency of less than 1%.

Postmarketing Experience:
- In the postmarketing experience section (6.2), it is noted that adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, making it difficult to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship.

Overall, while AMI appears as a serious adverse reaction to Proleukin, its occurrence seems to be uncommon, affecting less than 1% of patients based on clinical trial data and postmarketing reports. Given the seriousness of AMI and the potential for aldesleukin-induced capillary leak syndrome and other cardiovascular effects, the relationship between AMI and Proleukin administration is plausible, but the risk appears to be relatively low.

The drug label advises health professionals to monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of cardiac disorders, including AMI, and to withhold or discontinue the drug as indicated. Additionally, Proleukin is contraindicated in patients with significant cardiac impairment, which reflects the understanding of the risks associated with its administration in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.

In conclusion, there is evidence to suggest an infrequent occurrence of AMI in patients treated with aldesleukin, primarily based on clinical trial findings and additional rare postmarketing reports. Healthcare providers are cautioned to be vigilant for cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, when administering Proleukin.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,almotriptan,1.0,"Based on the drug label information provided, there is evidence to support that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a potential adverse reaction to almotriptan use. The relationship is most notably drawn from postmarketing experiences, as such reports specifically mention the occurrence of AMI following the administration of almotriptan tablets.

Clinical Trials: During controlled clinical trials of almotriptan in adults for the treatment of migraines, the most commonly reported adverse reactions included nausea, dry mouth, and paresthesia. The data from these trials did not report AMI as a common adverse event.

Postmarketing Surveillance: The reported adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of almotriptan tablets include instances of acute myocardial infarction. These reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size; thus, it is challenging to estimate their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to the drug exposure. Nevertheless, the inclusion of AMI as a postmarketing experience suggests that there have been reported incidents where AMI was associated temporally with the use of almotriptan.

Warnings and Precautions: The drug label states that serious cardiac events, including AMI, have been reported a few hours following the use of almotriptan. Although the incidence is described as ""extremely low,"" the possibility of a causal relationship cannot be ruled out. Particularly notable is the statement about patients with or without known cardiovascular disease experiencing such events, and the recommendation that patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to almotriptan administration.

The warnings section also underscores that almotriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, which is a risk factor for myocardial infarction. This suggests a biologically plausible mechanism through which the drug could, in rare cases, lead to AMI.

Overall, while the controlled clinical trial data provided does not commonly associate almotriptan with AMI, the postmarketing experiences, along with the information in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label, provide evidence that AMI is a potential adverse reaction of the drug. However, these events appear to be extremely rare and are more often reported in individuals with predisposing risk factors for coronary artery disease. Therefore, while a causal relationship has not been definitively established, healthcare professionals are advised to evaluate the cardiovascular risk before prescribing almotriptan, and patients should be closely monitored for cardiac symptoms during treatment, especially if they have risk factors for CAD.","NA

The provided drug label information does not offer evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to almotriptan. Instead, it acknowledges that serious cardiac reactions, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of almotriptan, although these events are described as extremely rare. The information further elaborates on the risk factors and the recommended precautions for use of the drug in patients with or at risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)."
acute myocardial infarction,alteplase,,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself is not an adverse reaction to alteplase, but rather a condition for which alteplase is indicated as a treatment due to its thrombolytic (clot-busting) properties. Alteplase, also known by its brand name Activase, is used to lyse thrombi in patients with AMI, acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and pulmonary embolism (PE) to improve perfusion and reduce the extent of infarction.

However, thrombolytic therapy with alteplase can carry risks and lead to potentially serious adverse reactions, and the most frequent adverse reaction associated with alteplase in all approved indications is bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. This risk also extends to causing or exacerbating myocardial rupture, a condition that can complicate AMI.

Evidence from clinical trials demonstrates that bleeding is a significant complication of alteplase therapy. In the context of AMI, the clinical trials experience, as noted in the drug label, indicates that significant internal bleeding has been observed in patients treated with a 3-hour infusion regimen of alteplase (Table 4). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in AMI patients treated with various doses of alteplase is documented in Table 5. The data show that while lower doses of alteplase (≤ 100 mg, accelerated or 1-1.4 mg/kg) have a lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, a dose of 150 mg, which is higher than the current standard dose, has been associated with an increase in intracranial bleeding and should not be used in AMI treatment.

The post-marketing experience, as detailed in the label, lists adverse reactions that were identified after approval and include serious cardiac-related events such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, and others. Although these are sequelae of the underlying disease (AMI), the effect of alteplase on the incidence of these events is not easily disentangled from the complications inherent to AMI.

In the section on Warnings and Precautions, the label advises that alteplase can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding, cautioning against its use in certain conditions that increase the risk of such hemorrhage. While the label does not specifically cite acute myocardial infarctions as an adverse reaction of alteplase, it does acknowledge the associated risks of bleeding that can accompany thrombolysis and may indirectly lead to worsening of AMI or complications thereof.

In summary, the relationship between alteplase and acute myocardial infarction is primarily that of a treatment modality rather than a cause of the condition. The available evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance centers around bleeding risks, including intracranial hemorrhage, which is the most frequently reported adverse reaction. Specific adverse events such as myocardial rupture may be exacerbated by alteplase in the setting of AMI; however, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse reaction directly attributable to alteplase. Careful risk assessment and management are required when administering alteplase to mitigate bleeding risks and other potentially fatal complications.","NA

The provided drug label sections for alteplase (Activase) do not include acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. Instead, the drug is indicated for the treatment of AMI. Evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and alteplase exposure would be irrelevant because the drug is utilized therapeutically for AMI due to its efficacy in dissolving blood clots that can cause such an event. Therefore, no evidence is needed to refute AMI as an adverse reaction of alteplase because it is, in fact, a condition alteplase is indicated to treat."
acute myocardial infarction,alvimopan,,"The evidence for a potential relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the drug alvimopan is derived from a 12-month clinical trial in patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. According to the drug label sections provided:

- In this 12-month study, there was a greater incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared to placebo-treated patients (alvimopan 0.5 mg: n=538; placebo: n=267). The majority of myocardial infarctions in the alvimopan group occurred between one and four months after treatment initiation.
  
- However, it is also stated that a causal relationship between long-term use of alvimopan and myocardial infarction has not been established. No increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed in short-term trials with alvimopan, including in patients undergoing surgeries that included bowel resection and who received the indicated dose of alvimopan (12 mg twice daily for up to 7 days).

Due to the potential risk of myocardial infarction with long-term use, alvimopan is available only for short-term use in the hospital setting (limited to 15 doses) under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Alvimopan REMS Program. 

For short-term use in the hospital setting at the indicated dose for the approved indication (to accelerate the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following surgeries that include a bowel resection), this imbalance in myocardial infarctions incidence has not been observed.

In summary, available evidence from a 12-month clinical trial suggests an increased incidence of myocardial infarction associated with long-term use of alvimopan at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily in patients treated with opioids for chronic pain. This evidence has led to regulatory measures that restrict the drug's use to short-term treatment under hospital supervision. However, there is no established causal link, and the observed increase in AMI was not noted in short-term use or at the approved dosage for the indicated patient population. This information is gathered from the drug label sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings) provided by the user.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,alvimopan,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Myocardial Infarction as an Adverse Reaction to Alvimopan:

Clinical Trials:
The most direct evidence comes from a 12-month clinical trial comparing alvimopan-treated patients to placebo in patients taking opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. In this study, a greater number of myocardial infarctions were reported in the cohort treated with alvimopan 12 mg (n = 538) versus placebo (n = 267). Specifically, myocardial infarctions were more frequent in the alvimopan group, with the majority of events occurring between 1 and 4 months after starting treatment. However, it's important to note that a causal relationship between myocardial infarction and long-term use of alvimopan has not been established.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
An increased incidence of myocardial infarction has been seen with long-term use based on post-marketing surveillance, which led to alvimopan being available only through a restricted Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for short-term hospital use (maxing out at 15 doses). The REMS program aims to mitigate the potential risk of myocardial infarction by controlling hospital use and ensuring that patients do not receive alvimopan beyond the stipulated doses or after being discharged from the hospital.

Comparative Analysis with Other Studies:
The observed imbalance in myocardial infarction incidence in the chronic pain cohort was not reported in other studies, including those within the surgical setting involving patients undergoing surgeries that included bowel resection, where alvimopan was used for up to 7 postoperative days (the indicated dose and patient population).

Case Studies:
The label does not refer to specific case studies related to myocardial infarction as an adverse effect of alvimopan.

In summary, the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and alvimopan appears to be based on the increased incidence observed in one particular long-term clinical trial involving patients on opioids for chronic pain, as well as implications drawn from post-marketing surveillance data. This evidence led to restrictions on the drug's use to mitigate potential cardiovascular risks. However, the available data does not conclusively establish a causal relationship, and the risk does not appear to be elevated in patients using alvimopan under the recommended short-term hospital usage for bowel resection surgeries.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,amifostine,,"Upon reviewing the sections provided from the drug label on amifostine (Ethiole), the evidence for an association between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and amifostine exposure is mentioned in the post-marketing experience section under Cardiac disorders. Here, myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse reaction alongside myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrest, and various arrhythmias.

However, it is important to note that post-marketing reports are voluntary, which means that the frequency and causality of these reported adverse reactions are not always reliably established. Post-marketing surveillance can signal potential adverse events, but the relationship between the drug and the reaction often requires further investigation to confirm.

In contrast to these voluntary reports, clinical trials offer controlled conditions to evaluate drug safety and efficacy. In the case of amifostine, the information provided from clinical trials (specifically, WR-1 and WR-38) does not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction. Instead, the trials report hypotension as a significant adverse event. Severe hypotension was described in detail in the Warnings and Precautions (5.3) section and can lead to serious sequelae, including cardiovascular events.

It should be recognized that while hypotension may contribute to myocardial ischemia due to reduced coronary perfusion, there is no direct evidence provided from the clinical trials linking amifostine to acute myocardial infarction. The presence of myocardial infarction in the post-marketing surveillance data indicates that there have been some reported instances following amifostine administration, but causality cannot be unequivocally established from these reports alone.

In conclusion, acute myocardial infarction is mentioned as an adverse reaction in the post-marketing surveillance reports for amifostine but is not detailed in the clinical trial data provided. Further investigation would be necessary to establish a causal link between amifostine and AMI. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients for signs of cardiovascular compromise and manage as per current clinical guidelines.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,amitriptyline,,"Based on the drug label sections provided for amitriptyline, there is mention of myocardial infarction (MI) under the list of adverse reactions, which suggests that there has been some observed relationship between amitriptyline and acute myocardial infarction. However, the labeling also notes that some of the listed adverse reactions may not have been reported with this specific drug but are included due to pharmacological similarities among tricyclic antidepressants. This implies that while MI is a known potential adverse effect of this class of medications, the specific incidence related to amitriptyline use may not be well-documented.

The drug label does not elaborate on the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data that led to the inclusion of MI as a potential adverse reaction. Without specific studies or evidence referenced, it is not possible to provide a rigorous evaluation of the likelihood or mechanism by which amitriptyline could cause an MI.

It is worth noting that cardiovascular side effects, such as ECG changes, arrhythmias, hypotension, and tachycardia, are listed among the adverse reactions for amitriptyline, which suggests that there is a recognized impact of the drug on the cardiovascular system. These effects, in theory, could potentially lead to more severe cardiovascular outcomes like myocardial infarction in certain patients. Due to the nature of tricyclic antidepressants and their pharmacological action, they are known to affect cardiac conductivity and function, which underlies the association with these types of adverse cardiovascular events.

Given the lack of detailed evidence in the label provided, clinicians prescribing amitriptyline should be aware of its potential cardiovascular risks and advise patients accordingly, especially those with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors for such conditions. Close monitoring for any cardiovascular symptoms during the use of amitriptyline would be prudent.

For a more definitive assessment of the relationship between amitriptyline and acute myocardial infarction, a review of the literature including peer-reviewed clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports would be required. This may reveal more specific data on the incidence, potential mechanisms, and risk factors for this serious adverse event.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction is listed as a cardiovascular adverse reaction to amitriptyline. This indicates that there is a recognized association between amitriptyline use and the occurrence of myocardial infarction. Therefore, refuting evidence is not presented, and the claim that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of amitriptyline is not supported by the drug label information. Consequently, no evidence is available to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction to amitriptyline, as the drug's label itself lists myocardial infarction as a possible adverse event."
acute myocardial infarction,amlodipine,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for amlodipine, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction to the drug. The majority of side effects associated with amlodipine appear to be mild to moderate in severity and are primarily related to dose-dependent edema, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence.

However, a relevant detail is mentioned under the warnings and precautions section (5.2) of the drug label. It states that worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can occur after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. This indicates that there is a recognized relationship between the use of amlodipine and the potential for acute myocardial infarction, especially in a specific patient population with pre-existing severe coronary artery disease.

The drug label does not provide frequency data or detailed clinical trial evidence specifically linking amlodipine to AMI. It seems the acknowledgment of this risk is based on clinical observations and the pharmacological effects of the drug, rather than a robust set of clinical trial data. The mechanism by which amlodipine could potentially prompt AMI in certain individuals may relate to the drug's vasodilatory effects, which in some cases may lead to reflex tachycardia and changes in coronary blood flow, possibly unmasking latent coronary artery disease and leading to ischemic events in susceptible individuals.

Additionally, the post-marketing experience (6.2) does not explicitly list AMI but does mention that such voluntary reports are uncertain in frequency and causality.

In conclusion, while acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a common adverse reaction to amlodipine, the drug's label does include a warning about the possibility of worsening angina or AMI after starting or increasing the amlodipine dose, specifically in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. This suggests a degree of evidence for a relationship between amlodipine use and the potential for acute myocardial infarction in a particular subset of patients, although detailed evidence from clinical trials is not provided on the label.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been documented as a potential adverse reaction under specific circumstances, namely in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine besylate (section 5.2 of the warnings). This indicates that there's acknowledgment of a possible relationship between AMI and amlodipine in certain clinical scenarios. Therefore, it is not appropriate to provide evidence refuting the relationship between AMI as an adverse reaction and amlodipine exposure when the provided drug label itself lists it as a warning."
acute myocardial infarction,amoxapine,1.0,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections focusing on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, there is evidence suggesting that various cardiovascular effects can occur with the use of amoxapine. However, the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) specifically is not mentioned as a frequent or common adverse reaction. It is listed under the section “Drug Relationship Unknown” among the reactions that have been reported rarely and occurred under conditions where a drug relationship was difficult to assess.

The evidence for AMI as a potential adverse reaction to amoxapine seems to arise from post-marketing surveillance, which involves collecting reports of adverse events once the drug is used in the general population outside of the controlled environment of clinical trials. These observations are often less controlled and may not always establish a clear causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event due to a wide variety of confounding factors. It is important to note, however, that post-marketing reports include a variety of cardiovascular issues, such as hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, and atrial arrhythmias, which are linked to the drug with an incidence rate of less than 1%.

There are no specific details about clinical trials or case studies provided in the provided sections of the drug label that establish a well-defined causal link between amoxapine use and acute myocardial infarction. Moreover, while cardiovascular adverse reactions are known to occur with antidepressants, incidents specifically leading to AMI are rare and seem to be reported in an unsystematic fashion making it difficult to determine the strength of the association.

It is also crucial to note that patients being treated with antidepressants, like amoxapine, may have an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior, and prescribers are advised to monitor patients closely after initiating therapy, especially in certain age groups.

In summary, while the provided drug label information indicates that there is a potential association with various cardiovascular effects, evidence from post-marketing surveillance suggests acute myocardial infarction may occur but is rare and the causal relationship with amoxapine is not well established. For a complete assessment, further investigation into clinical trial data, large scale epidemiological studies, and individual case reports would be helpful in clarifying this potential relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,amphetamine,,"The relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and amphetamine exposure is supported by the presence of cardiovascular adverse reactions listed in the drug label. Although AMI is not explicitly mentioned in the adverse reactions section, there are reports of palpitations, tachycardia, and elevation of blood pressure, which are conditions known to be associated with an increased risk of AMI. Additionally, the drug label cites isolated reports of cardiomyopathy with chronic amphetamine use; cardiomyopathy is a known risk factor for AMI.

The evidence for the association between amphetamine exposure and AMI primarily stems from the following sources:

1. **Case Studies**: Isolated reports of cardiomyopathy related to chronic amphetamine use suggest a possible link to acute myocardial infarction since cardiomyopathy can predispose individuals to AMI.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: The drug label mentions cardiovascular adverse reactions that have emerged from post-marketing surveillance. These reactions include palpitations, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure, which may indirectly support the association with AMI.

Notably, the drug label warnings emphasize the risk of abuse and misuse, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events. While overdose is specifically mentioned, it implies that at higher doses, or when used improperly, there is an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, potentially including AMI.

The limitations include the lack of direct mention of AMI as an adverse reaction and the absence of detailed quantitative data or controlled clinical trial evidence specifically associating amphetamine use with AMI. The evidence to date appears to be based on post-marketing reports, which may not be systematically gathered, and individual case studies rather than large-scale epidemiological studies.

In conclusion, while there is no direct clinical trial evidence linking amphetamine to acute myocardial infarction, there are reports of cardiovascular issues that could suggest a potential relationship. The drug label’s mention of cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular adverse reactions provides indirect support for this association. Further research, including controlled studies, would be needed to establish a definitive causal link between amphetamine exposure and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,anagrelide,,"Evidence from the provided drug label indicates that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a known adverse reaction associated with anagrelide use. This evidence is based on clinical trial data and post-marketing experience.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The clinical trials section (6.1) of the drug label mentions that in three single-arm clinical studies involving 942 patients with myeloproliferates neoplasms (including essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and other myeloproliferative neoplasms), patients were exposed to anagrelide (AGRYLIN) with a mean duration of approximately 65 weeks. Among the serious adverse reactions reported, myocardial infarction was explicitly listed. Additionally, other cardiovascular adverse events such as congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy were also noted, further highlighting the potential for significant cardiovascular toxicity associated with anagrelide.

The magnitude of risk for AMI, as well as other serious adverse reactions, led to the discontinuation of anagrelide treatment in 161 out of the 942 patients (17%) because of adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test results.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
The post-marketing experience section (6.2) does not specifically mention myocardial infarction; however, it does acknowledge other serious cardiac disorders such as Prinzmetal angina and Torsades de pointes, which were identified during the post-marketing use of AGRYLIN. This again reinforces that anagrelide use is associated with significant cardiac adverse reactions.

Warnings and Precautions:
Under the Warnings and Precautions section (5.1), the drug label advises obtaining a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), in all patients due to the potential for serious cardiovascular toxicity, such as QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia. Anagrelide is also known to increase the QTc interval and heart rate, further substantiating the cardiovascular risks linked with its use.

Conclusion:
Both the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance contained in the drug label provide evidence that acute myocardial infarction is an adverse reaction of anagrelide, alongside other cardiovascular toxicities. The inclusion in the Warnings and Precautions section of the need for pre-treatment cardiovascular examinations underscores the seriousness of the potential for cardiovascular adverse reactions with anagrelide treatment. Therefore, while specific incidence rates or comparative risk assessments are not provided, the label clearly acknowledges that AMI is among the observed serious adverse reactions in patients exposed to anagrelide.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,anastrozole,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for anastrozole, which is commonly used in the treatment of early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, there is some evidence of cardiovascular adverse events, including ischemic cardiovascular events.

From the **Clinical Trials Experience** section, specifically the ATUS (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial, we can extract the following points relevant to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction:

1. **Incidence in Clinical Trials**: AMI was reported in a small number of cases. Specifically, myocardial infarction was reported in 37 out of 3092 patients (approximately 1.2%) in the anastrozole arm compared to 34 out of 3094 patients (about 1.1%) in the tamoxifen arm.

2. **Patients with Pre-existing Ischemic Heart Disease**: It was observed that in the subgroup of women with pre-existing ischemic heart disease, 17% of those on anastrozole experienced ischemic cardiovascular events, compared to 10% on tamoxifen. Within this patient population, myocardial infarction specifically was reported in 0.9% of patients receiving anastrozole (2 out of 216 patients), while 3.2% (8 out of 249 patients) on tamoxifen experienced myocardial infarction.

3. **Comparison of Incidence**: It is important to note the rates of AMI between the two treatment groups did not show a statistically significant difference, indicating that anastrozole may not greatly increase the risk of AMI compared to tamoxifen.

4. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: As of the provided information, there is no mention of AMI in the post-marketing experience section of the drug label for anastrozole.

5. **Warnings and Precautions**: There is a warning for an increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease. Although AMI is a type of ischemic cardiovascular event, the warning does not mention AMI specifically.

In summary, the evidence from the ATAC clinical trial data presented in the drug label indicates a low incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with anastrozole, which does not appear to be significantly different from the control group treated with tamoxifen. There are no specific data listed in the post-marketing experience to suggest a direct relationship between anastrozole treatment and AMI beyond what was observed in clinical trials.

Patients with a pre-existing history of ischemic heart disease seem to have a higher incidence of ischemic events when taking anastrozole compared to tamoxifen; however, these figures also include a variety of ischemic events, not just AMI. The evidence provided suggests monitoring for ischemic heart disease when prescribing anastrozole, especially in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,andexanet alfa,,"Based on the sections provided from the drug label for andexanet alfa (ANDEXXA), there is evidence to suggest a potential relationship between the exposure to andexanet alfa and the adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The key points of evidence are summarized below:

1. **Clinical Trial Evidence (ANNEXA-4 study)**:
   - Among 352 subjects who received ANDEXXA for acute major bleeding events, thromboembolic events, including acute myocardial infarction, were reported. Specifically, AMI was observed in 10 out of 63 (16%) subjects who experienced thromboembolic events, with the median time to the event being seven days after ANDEXXA treatment.
   - Furthermore, of the 223 subjects who resumed anticoagulation within 30 days after ANDEXXA treatment, 18 (8%) experienced a thrombotic or ischemic event, which would include AMI.
   - It's important to note that these events were reported in a study population that received the drug due to pre-existing medical conditions requiring anticoagulation therapy, which could also be a contributing factor to the occurrence of AMI.

2. **Warnings and Precautions (Boxed Warning and Section 5.1)**:
   - The boxed warning and section 5.1 on the label explicitly state that treatment with ANDEXXA has been associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events such as arterial and venous thromboembolic events, ischemic events (including myocardial infarction), cardiac arrest, and sudden deaths.
   - The label advises monitoring for signs and symptoms of such events and suggests resuming anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate after ANDEXXA treatment to reduce thromboembolic risk.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**:
   - No specific details from the post-marketing surveillance were provided in the sections shared. However, the label includes instructions for reporting SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, indicating a system for collecting post-marketing data.

In conclusion, there is evidence from the ANNEXA-4 clinical trial and the warnings on the drug label that suggests a potential association between ANDEXXA and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. The exact nature of this relationship, whether causal or coincidental, is not definitively established due to the complexity of patient health status and the urgent clinical scenarios leading to the use of ANDEXXA.

It is recommended to monitor for adverse reactions and report any suspected cases to the appropriate channels, as mentioned in the drug label, to contribute to a better understanding of the drug's safety profile.","Based on the information provided, there is evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a potential adverse reaction in patients treated with andexanet alfa. In the ANNEXA-4 study, which is an ongoing study of subjects with acute major bleeding who had received factor Xa inhibitors, out of 352 subjects, 63 (18%) experienced thromboembolic events. Among these events, acute myocardial infarction occurred in 10 out of the 63 subjects (approximately 16% of the subjects with thromboembolic events). This indicates a reported association between andexanet alfa exposure and the occurrence of thromboembolic events, including AMI.

However, it is also important to note that in the same study, thromboembolic events were not observed in 223 healthy volunteers treated with factor Xa inhibitors and andexanet alfa. This suggests that the risk of thromboembolic events, including AMI, may not be the same across all populations and that the high-risk characteristics of the subjects with acute major bleeding should be considered when assessing the relationship between andexanet alfa and AMI.

The drug label also includes boxed warnings regarding the risks of thromboembolic events, ischemic events, cardiac arrest, and sudden deaths associated with andexanet alfa treatment. Patients are to be monitored for signs and symptoms of these events, and anticoagulation is to be resumed as soon as it is medically appropriate after treatment with andexanet alfa.

In the absence of evidence unequivocally refuting the relationship, it cannot be conclusively stated that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of andexanet alfa. The occurrence of AMI in the clinical trial setting points to an association that cannot be dismissed without further investigation. Therefore, the statement ""NA"" (not applicable) cannot be provided in this context.

In summary, there is evidence from the ongoing ANNEXA-4 study that suggests a possible association between andexanet alfa exposure and acute myocardial infarction, but the risk may vary between populations, and a causal relationship has not been firmly established. The evidence comes from the ANNEXA-4 study data and drug label warnings about thromboembolic and ischemic risks associated with andexanet alfa."
acute myocardial infarction,apalutamide,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for apalutamide (ERLEADA), evidence regarding acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to the drug is derived from clinical trial experiences rather than post-marketing surveillance or case studies.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
In the SPARTAN clinical study, which was a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study enrolling patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), there is a report that myocardial infarction occurred in 3 patients (0.37%) who were treated with ERLEADA. The median duration of exposure to ERLEADA was 33 months (range: 0.1 to 75 months). This is compared to a placebo group where there is no specific mention of AMI occurrence.

In the context of the TITAN study, a similar randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), ischemic cardiovascular events (which may include AMI among other conditions) occurred in 4.4% of patients treated with ERLEADA as compared to 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. The median duration of exposure for patients receiving ERLEADA in the TITAN study was 20 months (range: 0 to 34 months). While the mention of AMI specifically is not present in the contextual information for TITAN, ischemic cardiovascular events reported could potentially include AMI cases.

No mention of AMI was found in specific adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities tables (Table 1, 2, 3, 4) from the TITAN and SPARTAN studies, indicating that while they occurred, they were not among the most common adverse reactions. Data on serious adverse reactions in both the TITAN and SPARTAN trials also do not highlight AMI explicitly among the top occurrences.

Post-Marketing Experience:
The evidence from post-marketing surveillance is not explicitly provided pertaining to acute myocardial infarction.

Warnings and Precautions:
Warnings and precautions sections mention monitoring for ischemic heart disease and the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events suggest a recognition of potential risks related to heart conditions, which could encompass AMI as a serious cardiovascular event.

In summary, the drug label for apalutamide (ERLEADA) provides limited evidence from clinical trials (SPARTAN study) that acute myocardial infarction is a potential adverse reaction amongst patients treated with this drug, with specific mention of three cases. Furthermore, the increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events in the TITAN trial in the context of apalutamide treatment also suggests an increased risk for such adverse reactions, which may include AMI. No specific evidence from post-market surveillance directly references AMI as an adverse reaction to apalutamide, and AMI is not specifically listed among the common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities in the provided clinical trial data.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,aprepitant,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, there is no direct evidence in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data that links aprepitant to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. The common adverse reactions reported in adults and pediatric patients in clinical trials for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) included fatigue, diarrhea, asthenia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and others, but AMI was not listed.

Additionally, the less common adverse reactions in adult patients treated with aprepitant in clinical trials include a variety of other side effects such as oral candidiasis, pharyngitis, anemia, anxiety, dizziness, and palpitations, but again, AMI was not mentioned. Cardiac disorders listed were limited to palpitations, without reports of AMI.

Serious adverse reactions disclosed include Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a CINV study and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) from post-marketing experience. Neurotoxicity was reported in the setting of ifosfamide coadministration. However, these serious adverse events do not include AMI.

There is also a mention of clinically significant drug interactions due to CYP3A4 modulation, potential reduction in the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives, and a decrease in INR of prothrombin time when co-administered with warfarin. None of these, however, suggest a relationship with AMI.

Given the information contained within the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that supports a relationship between aprepitant exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. If further detailed investigation is required to make a conclusive determination, it would involve a thorough review of clinical case reports, scientific literature, and ongoing post-marketing surveillance data not provided here.","NA

Based on the information provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections of the drug label for aprepitant, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse reaction. Therefore, there is no available evidence from the given sections that refutes the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to aprepitant, as it is not mentioned as a known adverse reaction of the medication. The adverse reactions listed include various other potential side effects, but myocardial infarction is not among them."
acute myocardial infarction,arformoterol,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Myocardial Infarction as an Adverse Reaction of Arformoterol:

Based on the information provided from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, there is no directly listed evidence that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common adverse reaction associated with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution.

The clinical trial data for arformoterol, particularly from the short-term (12 weeks) and long-term (52 weeks) trials in adults with COPD, indicate a range of cardiovascular adverse events. These trials reported adverse events including angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and a general profile of beta2-agonist adverse reactions. However, the reported rates of cardiovascular adverse events were 6.9% for arformoterol 15 mcg twice daily and 13.3% for the placebo group, with no frequently occurring specific cardiovascular adverse events (frequency ≥1% and greater than placebo) for the arformoterol group.

Additionally, the evidence from these clinical trials does not indicate an increased risk of AMI with arformoterol when compared to placebo. The long-term safety trial demonstrated that COPD patients treated with arformoterol tartrate inhalation are not at an increased risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations compared to placebo.

Furthermore, while cardiovascular adverse reactions such as arteriosclerosis, atrial flutter, AV block, congestive heart failure, heart block, QT interval prolonged, and supraventricular tachycardia were mentioned as events with a frequency of <2% in patients treated with arformoterol and greater than that in placebo, myocardial infarction was not specifically listed as one of these cardiovascular adverse events.

Warnings and precautions sections of the label do suggest caution in using arformoterol in patients with cardiovascular disorders due to the possibility of exacerbating these conditions.

In conclusions, while there is an acknowledgment of increased cardiovascular risk in general with beta2-agonists like arformoterol, there is no specific evidence in the provided clinical trial data or label information that directly associates the use of arformoterol with an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction. Any relationship between AMI and arformoterol use would require further investigation through post-marketing surveillance studies or additional dedicated research to establish a causal link.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,argatroban,,"The available evidence on the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and argatroban exposure primarily comes from adverse event reporting in clinical trials, as highlighted in the information provided. It is important to note that while AMI is not listed as a common adverse reaction in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients treated with argatroban or in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), it has been reported in the context of argatroban use.

From the trials and post-marketing surveillance data provided:

- In PCI patients with HIT, myocardial infarction occurred in 3.6% of patients as shown in Table 7. Additionally, Table 8 reveals that in a subset of argatroban procedures (n = 112), 4 events of myocardial infarction were observed, translating to a 3.5% incidence rate among these patients.

- There is no explicit mention of AMI in HIT patients who have not undergone PCI, suggesting it was not a commonly reported event in the referenced clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2).

- Intracranial bleeding was reported in a separate investigational study that included patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving argatroban alongside thrombolytic therapy, with an overall frequency of 1% (8 out of 810 patients). However, this adverse event differs from AMI and is not directly related to the question at hand.

It is also worth noting that argatroban anticoagulation presents a hemorrhagic risk, which may indirectly affect cardiovascular outcomes, but this is distinct from directly causing myocardial infarctions.

From the data presented, while the adverse reaction of AMI occurs in a minority of patients treated with argatroban during PCI procedures, it is part of the documented adverse events. This information was obtained from clinical trials specifically designed to evaluate argatroban in the treatment of HIT and in patients undergoing PCI.

The evidence supporting a causal relationship between argatroban exposure and AMI is limited to these clinical trial observations, and no large-scale epidemiological studies or causal analyses have been provided. Thus, while there is some evidence of AMI occurrence in patients treated with argatroban, causality cannot be conclusively established based solely on the available data. 

Healthcare professionals should consider the risk of AMI as a serious adverse event in the context of argatroban use, particularly during PCI, monitor patients carefully, and report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate surveillance systems as advised by the drug label.","Refuting the relationship between adverse reactions and drug exposure requires evidence showing the lack of association between the suspected side effect and the drug in question.

In the provided drug label sections for argatroban, there is mention of various adverse reactions, including major and minor hemorrhagic reactions and non-hemorrhagic events. The non-hemorrhagic adverse reactions observed in HIT patients treated with argatroban included dyspnea, hypotension, fever, sepsis, and cardiac arrest. In patients with or at risk for HIT undergoing PCI, the adverse reactions listed include chest pain, hypotension, back pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and myocardial infarction, among others.

Specifically, regarding the assertion that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of argatroban, the label does list myocardial infarction as an observed non-hemorrhagic adverse reaction in patients undergoing PCI with a reported frequency of 3.6% in the treated population. Additionally, myocardial infarction is listed under the serious adverse reactions section with a frequency of 3.5% in argatrobatran procedures. Thus, based on the information provided, myocardial infarction is indeed recognized as an adverse reaction in the context of PCI in patients with or at risk for HIT.

Therefore, there is no evidence within the provided drug label sections that explicitly refutes the association between acute myocardial infarction and argatroban. It seems that acute myocardial infarction is recognized as an adverse event that can occur in patients treated with argatroban during PCI procedures. Hence, the appropriate response is “NA,” as the premise to refute the association is not supported by the available evidence from the drug label provided."
acute myocardial infarction,aripiprazole,,"Based on the extensive information provided, which includes adverse reactions, warnings, and clinical trial experiences, there is no direct evidence listed that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a commonly observed adverse reaction related to the use of aripiprazole. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in adult and pediatric populations include symptoms related to akathisia, sedation, gastrointestinal complaints, and extrapyramidal symptoms, among others. Specifically, the adverse reactions section (Clinical Trials Experience 6.1) provides detailed descriptions of adverse events in different patient populations but does not list AMI as a common adverse event.

However, under the subsection ""Cardiac Disorders"" under infrequent adverse reactions for adults during postmarketing experience (outside of controlled clinical trials), myocardial infarction is listed, suggesting that there have been rare reports of such events. Notably, because these instances are from voluntary postmarketing reports, it is challenging to establish a clear causal relationship due to the variability in quality of data, potential underreporting, and lack of controlled conditions.

The warnings and precautions sections detail risks associated with the use of aripiprazole, including cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, orthostatic hypotension, and seizures. While certain cardiovascular risks are acknowledged (e.g., cerebrovascular events), acute myocardial infarction as a direct adverse reaction to aripiprazole is not prominently featured.

Therefore, the relationship between aripiprazole and acute myocardial infarction appears to be recognized only in the context of postmarketing experience where other contributing factors cannot be ruled out, and the incidence is infrequent. Clinical trial data provided does not establish AMI as a common or expected adverse reaction to aripiprazole.

It is important for clinicians to assess each patient's individual risk factors for cardiovascular disease and to closely monitor any patient taking aripiprazole for signs and symptoms indicative of cardiac pathology, particularly given the reports of AMI, amongst other adverse cardiac events, during postmarketing surveillance. However, caution should be taken before attributing such events directly to aripiprazole due to confounding factors that may be present in the postmarketing population.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,aripiprazole lauroxil,,"Upon reviewing the provided drug label sections for ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil), there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials cited for schizophrenia, nor is there a specified connection made in the warnings and precautions sections of the label directly to AMI.

From the ""Clinical Studies Experience"" section for ARISTADA, the commonly observed adverse reactions include akathisia, with other nervous system disorders such as headache and insomnia mentioned. Injection site reactions and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including dystonia and parkinsonism, are also listed among the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials. However, there is no specific mention of AMI in these sections or in the ""Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies"" subsection.

In contrast, the ""Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials with Oral Aripiprazole"" subsection does list ""myocardial infarction"" among several cardiovascular conditions reported in clinical trials with oral aripiprazole, which is another form of the drug. This suggests that there may be evidence of AMI occurring in patients treated with oral aripiprazole. However, it is not clear if these events were determined to be directly caused by the drug or were incidentally associated with its use. Additionally, this evidence is not specific to the extended-release injectable formulation ARISTADA but to the oral formulation of the compound.

Regarding post-marketing experience, which encompasses reports from a broader range of sources after a drug is released on the market, there is no mention of AMI related specifically to ARISTADA. The post-marketing adverse reactions listed in the label mostly focus on allergic reactions, pathological gambling, hiccups, blood glucose fluctuations, oculogyric crisis, and a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).

In summary, while the drug label mentions myocardial infarction in connection with clinical trials of oral aripiprazole, there is no direct evidence in the label that associates acute myocardial infarction with the use of ARISTADA, the extended-release injectable formulation. Any potential risks of AMI related to ARISTADA would require further research and post-marketing surveillance to determine if there is a substantial connection between the drug and this adverse event. If more detailed and targeted evidence is requested, it may be best to consult medical literature databases, the latest clinical trial data, or the FDA's adverse event reporting system for updates post the knowledge cutoff date.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a commonly observed adverse reaction nor as a specific warning or precaution for aripiprazole lauroxil (brand name ARISTADA). While the label does mention cardiac disorders such as ""cardiorespiratory arrest,"" ""atrioventricular block,"" ""atrial fibrillation,"" ""myocardial ischemia,"" and ""myocardial infarction"" in the context of adverse reactions reported with oral aripiprazole (a different formulation from ARISTADA), it does not directly associate these conditions with the use of aripiprazole lauroxil.

The provided label also includes a Boxed Warning regarding increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs, noting that most deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. However, it does not specifically mention AMI in this context.

Overall, the provided drug label sections do not refute or confirm the relationship between AMeli and the use of aripiprazole lauroxil. Without evidence directly refuting the relationship between AMI and aripiprazole lauroxil, it is not possible to conclusively state that AMI is not an adverse reaction of the drug. Only a systematic review of clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and published case reports could provide definitive evidence to refute such a relationship. Therefore, based on the provided information from the drug label alone, the relationship between AMI and aripiprazole lauroxil remains indeterminate.

For a definitive conclusion on this matter, further investigation into clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing data would be needed."
acute myocardial infarction,atenolol,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for atenolol, evidence suggests that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not primarily listed as a direct adverse reaction from atenolol treatment. Instead, complications such as bradycardia and hypotension are more commonly reported, which can be associated with AMI management.

From clinical investigations related to the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the drug label notes that bradycardia and hypotension occurred more often in atenolol-treated patients than in control patients. This is an expected outcome for beta-blockers like atenolol. These conditions generally responded to appropriate measures such as atropine administration or withholding further dosage of atenolol.

In one study described on the label involving 477 patients, adverse events reported during atenolol administration in the context of AMI included bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, heart failure, and various types of cardiac arrhythmias. However, it is important to note that the incidence of heart failure was not increased by atenolol.

The International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1) referenced in the drug label included over 16,000 patients, with 8,037 randomized to receive atenolol. In this study, reduction or discontinuation of atenolol dosage was necessary in some patients due to hypotension, bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, and other cardiac events. While specific numbers are presented for dose reduction due to various reasons, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction as a resulting adverse event from atenolol administration.

Post-marketing surveillance lists some adverse reactions reported in temporal association with atenolol use but does not specifically mention AMI as an identified adverse outcome.

In summary, the drug label for atenolol provides evidence of an association between atenolol and certain cardiovascular reactions like bradycardia and hypotension during the management of acute myocardial infarction. However, there is no explicit evidence within the provided sections of the drug label that directly lists acute myocardial infarotation as an adverse reaction resulting from atenolol administration. Any relationship between atenolol and AMI would be more associated with its therapeutic use in the management of AMI, rather than atenolol being the cause of AMI.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,atezolizumab,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exposure to atezolizumab, marketed as TECENTRIQ, is discussed in various sections of the drug's label, particularly within the contexts of clinical trial experiences and postmarketing experience.

In the information provided from clinical trials and postmarketing data:

**Clinical Trials Experience with TECENTRIQ as a Single Agent:**
- Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% of patients receiving TECENTRIQ; this included a single case of acute myocardial infarction. The context or detailed circumstances around this case are not provided in the summary.
- In the IMpower110 study, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.8% of patients receiving TECENTRIQ, which also included a case of acute myocardial infarction.

**Clinical Trials Experience with TECENTRIQ in Combination Therapy:**
- There is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction occurring in patients when TECENTRIQ is used in combination with other antineoplastic drugs or when used with cobimetinib and vemurafenib.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
- Among the various cardiovascular adverse reactions reported postmarketing, myocarditis is mentioned, but there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction in the postmarketing section.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- The warnings and precautions section does not specifically mention acute myocardial infarction as an immune-mediated adverse reaction. It highlights myocarditis as a potential serious cardiac-related immune-mediated adverse reaction.

Based on the details from the provided sections, there is a limited reported incidence of acute myocardial infarction associated with the use of TECENTRIQ from clinical trials. The mention is brief and does not provide data on the incidence rate or establish a direct causal relationship between atezolizumabad and AMI. Moreover, the postmarketing data, which could provide further insight into rare adverse events, does not explicitly list AMI, although it does mention myocarditis, which can be related to cardiovascular adverse effects. 

More detailed investigation into individual case reports and a broader analysis of clinical data would be required to better understand the relationship between TECENTRIQ and the potential for AMI as an adverse reaction. Furthermore, the presence of pre-existing risk factors or comorbidities that could predispose patients to AMI would also need to be considered when evaluating such cases.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,atropine,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no direct evidence stated that specifically links acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to the use of atropine. The adverse reactions section and various warnings focus primarily on the well-established antimuscarinic effects of atropine, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, photophobia, tachycardia, anhidrosis, constipation, difficulty in micturition, hypersensitivity reactions, and potentially serious effects on conditions like glaucoma, pyloric obstruction, urinary retention, and chronic lung disease. Tachycardia is mentioned as a common result of atropine administration and there is a specific warning regarding the use of atropine in patients with coronary artery disease due to the potential increase in myocardial oxygen demand which could theoretically lead to complications including AMI.

However, the relationship between atropine exposure and acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly reported as an identified adverse reaction. The mention of restricted dosing in patients with coronary artery disease to mitigate the risk associated with tachycardia hints at a possible concern for cardiac events like AMI, but this is not reported as a directly observed outcome.

In summary, while tachycardia induced by atropine could theoretically increase the risk of an acute myocardial infarction in susceptible individuals (such as those with coronary artery disease), the specific evidence that directly links atropine exposure to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction is not provided in the drug label excerpts. Further investigation into clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that are not included in this label would be necessary to establish a more definitive causal relationship. If such publications exist, they are not referenced in the supplied drug label information. Thus, based on the available information, we cannot confirm a directly supported evidence-based relationship between atropine use and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,avanafil,,"Avanafil, marketed under the brand name Stendra, is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Based on the provided drug label sections, there is postmarketing evidence that suggests a temporal association between the use of Stendra and cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction. However, it is important to highlight the following points from the available information:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:**
   The clinical trials conducted, as summarized in the drug label, do not report acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction. Common adverse reactions greater than or equal to 2% include headache, flushing, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, and back pain. Less common adverse events (<2%) related to cardiovascular issues include hypertension and palpitations. However, it is mentioned that ""a causal relationship to Stendra is uncertain.""

2. **Postmarketing Experience:**
   In the postmarketing experience, serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, cerebrovascular accident, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been reported. It is noted that these events have occurred in association with the use of Stendra, but it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary nature of these reports. Additionally, all of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.

3. **Warnings and Precautions:**
   The warnings section of the label advises caution in prescribing Stendra to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease since there is the potential for cardiac risk during sexual activity. The label also recommends against the use of Stendra in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. This section does not directly state that Stendra causes myocardial infarction but does acknowledge the potential risk for cardiovascular adverse events in a general sense due to the vasodilatory effect of the medication.

In conclusion, while acute myocardial infarction has been reported in postmarketing surveillance as temporally associated with Stendra use, there is no conclusive evidence from clinical trials that directly establishes avanafil as a causative factor. The presence of cardiovascular events in postmarketing reports, alongside existing cardiovascular risk factors in these patients, suggests the need for further research to clarify the relationship. Healthcare providers should use caution when prescribing Stendra to patients with known cardiovascular risks and discuss with them the potential risks and benefits before starting treatment.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,avanafil,,"Avanafil, marketed under the name STENDRA, is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). According to the provided drug label sections, clinical trials have been pivotal in determining the safety and adverse reaction profile of avanafil.

The clinical trials section details that avanafil was given to 2215 men across randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 3 months duration, with a subset also being observed in an open-label, long-term extension study of up to 52 weeks. Common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2%) reported included headache, flushing, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, and back will pain. These trials were crucial in identifying the frequency and types of adverse reactions but did not specifically identify acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction (≥2%).

In terms of myocardial infarction, the postmarketing experience section of the drug label is informative and relevant. It reports that ""serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction,"" have been noted post-marketing in temporal association with the use of STENDRA. However, it also states that all of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and emphasizes that a direct relationship between avanafil use and these serious events could not be definitively established.

It is important to note that sexual activity itself carries potential cardiac risk, especially in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, and this is reflected under the Warnings and Precautions section of the drug label. The drug is advised not to be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status. Moreover, the label indicates that avanafil should not be prescribed to patients with a recent history of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is mentioned in the context of postmarketing reports, the available evidence does not definitively establish that AMI is a direct adverse reaction to avanafil. Instead, the drug label suggests that the potential for such events may be more related to underlying cardiovascular risk factors or the increased cardiac demands of sexual activity, rather than a direct causative effect of the drug itself. It is crucial to consider these factors when prescribing STENDRA, particularly in populations at risk for cardiovascular events.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,avelumab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for avelumab (BAVENCIO), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is a severe type of heart attack, has been documented as an adverse reaction in patients treated with BAVENCIO as part of combination therapy with axitinib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). It should be noted that AMI is not listed as a common adverse reaction when avelumab is used as monotherapy or when combined with best supportive care for other indications.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The adverse reactions section of the label for avelumab mentions that myocardial infarction (including acute myocardial infarction and troponin T increased) led to permanent discontinuation of the drug in 1.5% of patients treated with BAVENCIO in combination with best supportive care (BSC) for patients with urothelial carcinoma. Additionally, in the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial, which evaluated avelumab in combination with axitinib for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in 7% of patients, including Grade 3-4 myocardial infarction in 2.8% of patients. Median time to onset of MACE was 4.2 months, ranging from 2 days to 24.5 months.

Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions:
The Warnings and Precautions section highlights that BAVENCIO in combination with axitinib can result in severe and fatal cardiovascular events. The incidence of MACE was reported to be higher, at 7%, in patients with advanced RCC treated with this combination compared to 3.4% in those treated with sunitinib. Deaths due to cardiac events constituted 1.4% of these adverse reactions, and patients were advised to be monitored for cardiovascular risk factors, with a recommendation for discontinuation of BAVENCIO and axitinib for Grade 3-4 events.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
While the provided summary does not include specific post-marketing surveillance data, such data could potentially yield additional reports of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular adverse events associated with avelumab, especially since patients in the broader community may have different characteristics compared to those selected for clinical trials.

In conclusion, clinical trial data from the JAVELIN Renal 101 support the relationship between avelumab in combination with axitinib and the risk of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. This adverse reaction is significant enough to warrant its mention in the Warnings and Precautions, as well as the clinical trials data section of the drug label. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients receiving this combination for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events. It is important for prescribing clinicians to balance the therapeutic benefits of avelumab with the potential risks of severe cardiovascular events.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,bendamustine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections and my knowledge up to the cutoff date, evidence directly linking acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to bendamustine (TREANDA) is not explicitly stated in the clinical trial results or listed within the common adverse events. However, under the Postmarketing Experience section, myocardial infarction, including some fatal cases, is mentioned as an identified adverse event during the post-approval use of TREANDA. This implies that there have been reports of AMI in patients who received bendamustine after the drug was approved and made available to the public. These post-marketing surveillance reports are voluntary and often lack detailed information that would allow for a reliable estimate of frequency or a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure. 

It's important to consider that the patient population receiving bendamustine may have other risk factors predisposing them to AMI, such as underlying malignancies or pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, which can confound the attribution of the adverse reaction to the medication alone. 

Therefore, while there is post-market evidence suggesting a potential relationship between bendamustine exposure and acute myocardial infarction, the evidence does not appear to come from controlled clinical trials or systematic case studies. The lack of robust data means that causality cannot be established with certainty, and healthcare professionals should monitor for cardiovascular symptoms as part of the overall safety evaluation during bendamustine therapy. Patients receiving bendamustine should be assessed for their individual risk factors for AMI and cardiovascular conditions should be managed according to standard care principles.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,bendamustine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for bendamustine, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or heart attack is listed as one of the potential adverse cardiovascular reactions identified during post-marketing surveillance. The label explicitly mentions ""myocardial infarction (some fatal)"" under the section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience, which documents adverse reactions discovered after the drug has been approved and is being used in broader patient populations.

Clinical trials data provided in the label mainly discuss the myelosuppressive effects of bendamustine, infections, and infusion reactions, among other adverse reactions. However, the specific occurrence of AMI in the context of controlled clinical trials is not detailed in the sections provided.

To further substantiate the claim of AMI as a potential adverse reaction, it would be necessary to consult the full post-marketing surveillance data, individual case reports, and available literature or databases encompassing outcomes in patients treated with bendamustine. It’s important to consider that post-marketing reports can suggest associations but do not necessarily prove causality. Adverse reactions in these reports may result from several factors, including pre-existing conditions, use of other medications, or patient demographics and health states.

In summary, although the drug label does mention myocardial infarction as an adverse event reported during the post-approval use of bendamustine, it does not provide information on the incidence, context, or any potential risk factors that may contribute to these events. To fully understand and evaluate the evidence of AMI being an adverse reaction to bendamustine, access to detailed post-marketing reports and a review of the broader scientific literature would be required.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,betamethasone,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label's adverse reactions section for betamethasone, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to the drug. Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is commonly prescribed to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response in various conditions. The listed adverse reactions primarily concern local effects on the skin due to topical application, such as burning, itching, irritation, and other skin-related side effects.

Acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, involves the interruption of blood flow to a part of the heart, causing heart muscle cells to be damaged or die. The relationship between systemic corticosteroids and increased cardiovascular risk is a subject of ongoing research, and some studies suggest that systemic corticosteroids may contribute to cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, which could, in theory, lead to an increased risk of AMI. However, this general potential risk differs from directly linking the use of betamethasone as a topical agent to AMI.

To summarize the available evidence:

1. Clinical Trials: There is no direct evidence from clinical trials that links topical betamethasone to acute myocardial infarction among its adverse reactions.

2. Case Studies: Case studies specific to acute myocardial infarction caused by betamethasone are not mentioned, suggesting that no strong or direct correlation has been observed that warrants inclusion in these sections of the label.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: Post-marketing surveillance has not identified acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction specifically associated with betamethasone based on the information provided in the adverse reactions section of the drug label.

In conclusion, there is no known evidence, as of the latest information provided, to support the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the usage of betamethasone, particularly when used as a topical preparation. If there were concerns or individual case reports that suggest a potential link, these are not part of the label's listed adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings. Healthcare providers typically rely on the thorough examination of such data before establishing a clear causal relationship between a medication and an adverse reaction as serious as AMI. Therefore, to infer such an association, more specific clinical data or epidemiological studies would be required.","NA

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed among the local adverse reactions associated with the topical corticosteroid betamethasone, as per the provided sections of the drug label. The listed adverse reactions primarily relate to dermatological effects, which are known to be associated with topical steroids. If evidence arises refuting or supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and betamethasone exposure, it must be drawn from additional sources including clinical trials, pharmacovigilance data, and well-documented case reports. As of the current knowledge cutoff, no such evidence has been provided or mentioned in the relevant sections of the drug label."
acute myocardial infarction,betaxolol,,"Based on the sections you provided from the drug label for betaxolol, which encompass adverse reactions and warnings, there is no direct evidence within these sections that explicitly establishes acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a known adverse reaction attributable to betaxolol based on controlled clinical trials. However, myocardial infarction is listed among the potentially important adverse events that have been reported with an incidence of less than 2% in U.S. controlled and open, long-term clinical studies, European controlled clinical trials, or in marketing experience.

The label does indicate that although a causal relationship has not been established between myocardial infarction and betaxolol use, myocardial infarction has been reported in clinical practice where patients have been receiving betaxolol. This reporting suggests that myocardial infarction could potentially be an adverse reaction of betaxolol, but without further data, we cannot conclusively confirm the relationship. It is important to note that such reports are insufficient on their own to establish causation due to the lack of controlled comparative data and the potential for confounding factors.

The development of adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction can theoretically be associated with the pharmacodynamic effects of beta-blockade, which includes the reduction of heart rate, cardiac output, and the potential masking of hypoglycemia — factors that could contribute to cardiovascular events under certain conditions. However, beta-blockers are also used therapeutically for the prevention of myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting a complex relationship between beta-blockade and cardiac events.

In summary, while myocardial infarction has been reported in patients taking betaxolol, the current information from the drug label does not provide strong evidence of a causal relationship. Controlled clinical trials, detailed case studies, or more robust post-marketing surveillance data would be needed to establish a definitive link between betaxolol use and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,bicalutamide,,"The sections provided from the drug label for bicalutamide do not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials. Adverse reactions that occurred in more than 10% of patients receiving bicalutamide plus an LHRH-A (Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Analogue) included hot flashes, various pains (general, back, pelvic, and abdominal), asthenia, constipation, infection, nausea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, diarrhea, hematuria, nocturia, and anemia. AMI is not specifically mentioned in these common adverse reactions (Section 6.1).

However, under the potential adverse reactions listed in the bicalutamide-LHRH analog treatment group that are reported at less than 5% incidence, myocardial infarction is mentioned (Section 6.1 under Body as a Whole). Thus, while acute myocardial infarction is listed, it appears to be a rare adverse reaction and not frequently occurring in patients treated with bicalutamide in combination with an LHRH analog.

Additionally, there is mention of cardiovascular adverse effects in the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), but these are not quantified, and it is stated that they are based on voluntary reports and uncertain in frequency. The cardiovascular adverse reactions listed include angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarct, heart arrest, coronary artery disorder, and syncope, among others.

In summary, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to bicalutamide is observed but seems to be infrequent, as indicated by its listing under adverse effects occurring in less than 5% of patients in clinical trials. Additionally, AMI is listed in the less common adverse effects observed in postmarketing surveillance. Thereby, while there is evidence of AMI occurrence in patients taking bicalutamide, the evidence suggests it is an uncommon or rare adverse reaction based on the provided drug label information. Direct comparison of adverse reaction rates between bicalutamide and other drugs is not possible from the provided sections, as clinical trial conditions can vary widely.","Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for bicalutamide, acute myocardial infarction is listed under ""Body as a Whole"" within the ""Other adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2%, but less than 5%)"" category in the bicalutamide-LHRH analog treatment group. This indicates that while myocardial infarction has been reported, it is considered a rare event with an incidence of 2% to less than 5%. It is important to note, however, that this does not inherently establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The lack of a clear causal link can be attributed to several factors:

1. The incidence of myocardial infarction in patients taking bicalutamide appears to fall within a low percentage range (2% to less than 5%), which suggests it is not a common adverse reaction to the drug.

2. The nature of postmarketing surveillance, where adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, can sometimes make it difficult to establish frequency and causality.

3. Myocardial infarction may co-occur due to other pre-existing conditions or risk factors in the patients who experienced this adverse event, which could confound the relationship with bicalutamide.

4. Bicalutamide is used in the treatment of prostate cancer, often in an older population who may have underlying risk factors for heart diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis, which could independently contribute to the risk of myocardial infarction.

It is essential to evaluate individual patient risk factors and clinical context when interpreting adverse reaction data, as well as to review further research and clinical data for more definitive information regarding causality.

If more specific studies or data analysis have been conducted to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and bicalutamide exposure, it is not provided in the provided drug label sections. Clinical judgment should be exercised when considering these data, keeping in mind the potential for confounding factors in postmarketing reports and the importance of individualized risk assessment for patients."
acute myocardial infarction,binimetinib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction specifically associated with the use of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib. However, there are related cardiovascular adverse events reported:

In the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.2), cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction, has been reported in patients treated with binimetinib in combination with encorafenib.

In the section about BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is mention of myocardial infarction – ""Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients who received MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of due to patients included ... myocardial infarction ..."" This suggests that myocardial infarction has been observed in at least 2% of patients in this specific population.

It is important to discern that while myocardial infarction is mentioned, it is not characterized as a common adverse reaction to binimetinib, and no specific incidence rate is provided for melanoma patients (it is mentioned under NSCLC), which indicates that the occurrence might be rare or specific to certain populations.

For a comprehensive analysis, a thorough review of detailed study data and post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary. If those sources reveal cases of myocardial infarction associated with binimetinib use, then a causal relationship may be considered. As of now, based on the provided label sections, myocardial infarction is acknowledged as a serious adverse event in a subset of patients treated with binimetinib in combination with encorafenib but is not highlighted as a common or characteristic adverse reaction for the general patient population taking the drug. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to be vigilant and closely monitor patients for any signs of cardiac dysfunction, and patients should be informed of the potential risks associated with the drug.","NA

The information provided in the drug label does not refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure to binimetinib (MEKTOVI). Therefore, based on the label sections provided, it is not possible to provide evidence refuting the relationship between AMI and binimetinib as the adverse reaction of myocardial infarction is explicitly listed under serious adverse reactions in patients (1% each for myocardial infarction and intracranial hemorrhage in the PHAROS trial section). Please note that full appraisal of the data from clinical studies and other relevant sources might be needed for a comprehensive evaluation."
acute myocardial infarction,bleomycin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) appears to be an adverse reaction reported in association with the use of bleomycin, particularly when used in combination with other antineoplastic agents. The label indicates that vascular toxicities, which can include myocardial infarction, are rare and that these events present a clinically heterogeneous picture.

It's important to highlight that the occurrence of these cardiovascular adverse events, such as myocardial infarction, is not described as a direct and common side effect of bleomycin alone, but rather as a potential risk when the drug is used in conjunction with other cancer therapies. Details such as the frequency of occurrence, patient characteristics most at risk, and the exact mechanism by which bleomycin might contribute to the development of AMI are not provided in the label.

The label's emphasis on pulmonary toxicity as the most serious and frequent concern with bleomycin use might suggest that AMI is a much less common adverse reaction. Moreover, the label acknowledges the challenge in distinguishing bleomycin toxicity from other syndromes observed in cancer patients, which may also apply to differentiating the specific cause of a myocardial infarction in patients receiving complex antineoplastic regimens.

It is also important to note that post-marketing surveillance data may not be as robust as data derived from randomized controlled trials. The label does not mention specific clinical trial findings regarding AMI as a side effect of bleomycin. This might reflect the rarity of such an event or potentially insufficient data on this specific outcome.

In summary, while there is mention in the drug label of myocardial infarction as a potential adverse event, there is a lack of detailed evidence provided in this excerpt to fully support the characterization of acute myocardial infarction as a direct and frequent adverse reaction specific to bleomycin exposure. Instead, it appears to be a rare occurrence, possibly associated with the use of bleomycin in combination therapy. Furthermore, there's no concrete evidence provided from clinical trials or case studies that directly links bleomycin with acute myocardial infarction as a stand-alone adverse effect. Hence, while there is a mention of AMI in the context of multiple drug regimens potentially including bleomycin, conclusive evidence attributing AMI to bleomycin alone is not presented in this label information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,bortezomib,,"The information provided indicates that bortezomib is associated with a range of adverse reactions, some of which have cardiovascular implications. However, a specific relation to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not detailed in the safety profile or clinical trial results you provided. 

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The safety of bortezomib is characterized through its clinical trial data. Adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, anemia, vomiting, and others are commonly reported. Cardiac toxicity is mentioned as a risk, with a note that worsening of and development of cardiac failure has occurred, and patients should be monitored if they have heart disease or risk factors for it. 

Within the provided data, there is no mention of bortezomib directly causing acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse effect in the analyzed clinical trial populations. However, it does note an occurrence of cardiac-related adverse events, such as congestive heart failure and cardiac arrest, in relapsed multiple myeloma studies, and cardiac adverse reactions are advised to be monitored (Warnings and Precautions 5.3).

Postmarketing Experience:
The postmarketing experience section does not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction. However, cardiac disorders that could be related to AMI, such as cardiac failure, have been reported. Since these reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, establishing a causal relationship to bortezomib exposure is challenging.

Box Warnings and Warnings and Precautions:
The provided sections on Warnings and Precautions and Box Warnings do not directly reference acute myocardial infarction. The Cardiac Toxicity warning (5.3) does, however, discuss the risk of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and the development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure.

In summary, while there is evidence of cardiac toxicity associated with bortezomib, such as heart failure and decreased ejection fraction, there is no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction in the clinical trial data or drug labeling information provided. Cardiac events have been observed post-marketing, but these do not establish a clear and direct causal relationship with bortezomib due to a lack of detailed data. Therefore, while there is a general cardiovascular risk with bortezomib treatment, confirming a direct relationship with acute myocardial infarction would require further investigation into reported cases and more explicit evidence from clinical or observational studies.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,bromocriptine,1.0,"Based on the drug label sections provided, there is evidence from postmarketing experience that suggests a potential association between bromocriptine use and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Although acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials section for bromocriptine indications such as hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, or Parkinson's disease, it is mentioned in the context of postmarketing experience, particularly among postpartum patients.

The drug label details that in the postmarketing experience in the U.S., there have been reports of serious adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, in postpartum patients treated with bromocriptine. Specifically, the label documents 9 cases of AMI amongst this group. It is important to note that the causal relationship between these AMI cases and bromocriptine administration has not been firmly established. The evidence provided is from voluntary reports which mean the actual frequency and a conclusive causal relationship cannot be reliably estimated.

Furthermore, the label advises caution, especially in postpartum women receiving bromocriptine, and suggests periodic monitoring of blood pressure due to the rare serious adverse events such as hypertension and myocardial infarction that have been reported. It is stated that if severe, progressive, or unremitting headache (with or without visual disturbances), or evidence of CNS toxicity develop, bromocriptine administration should be discontinued, and the patient should be promptly evaluated. This implies a recognized risk for serious cardiovascular events, though again, the causality is uncertain.

The information provided does not mention the outcome of the myocardial infarction cases in terms of severity or any long-term consequences for the patients.

In summary, the drug label implies a possible relationship between bromocriptine and acute myocardial infarction based on postmarketing reports, particularly in postpartum women. However, the evidence is from voluntary reports with uncertain frequency and causality. There are no specific details from clinical trials or case studies directly linking AMI with bromocriptine in the provided sections of the drug label.","Based on the provided drug label sections for bromocriptine (Parlodel), there is a mention of myocardial infarction in the context of postmarketing experience among postpartum patients. The label acknowledges reports of nine cases of myocardial infarction in the postmarketing setting. However, the relationship of these adverse reactions to bromocriptine administration has not been established, indicating a lack of concrete evidence directly linking bromocriptine with acute myocardial infarction as a side effect.

To refute a potential connection between bromocriptine and acute myocardial infarction, evidence would typically consist of large-scale randomized controlled trials or comprehensive epidemiological studies demonstrating no increased risk of myocardial infarction with bromocriptine use compared with controls. Given that such specific refuting evidence is not provided in the drug label excerpts, it's not possible to conclusively state that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of bromocriptine based solely on this information.

To provide a definitive conclusion, additional research surveys, such as a systematic review of controlled clinical trials and case-control studies, meta-analyses, and observational cohort studies, would be required to assess the incidence rate of acute myocardial infarction among bromocriptine users versus non-users.

In the absence of explicit refuting evidence within the provided label sections, it can only be stated that the label mentions myocardial infarction in postmarketing reports without a clear cause-and-effect relationship established. NA"
acute myocardial infarction,bupropion,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for bupropion, there is mention under the Cardiovascular subsection of rare cases of myocardial infarction (heart attack). The sections suggest that myocardial infarction can occur infrequently as an adverse event associated with the use of bupropion. This classification of 'rare' implies that such adverse reactions have been reported in less than 1 in 1,000 patients taking bupropion. It is important to note that the evidence for a direct causal link between bupropion and acute myocardial infarction may not be as robust as for other adverse reactions, due to its rarity and the potential for confounding factors.

The information you've provided indicates that the adverse reaction of myocardial infarction (heart attack) has been observed, but its incidence is considered rare (as not all events could be determined to be certainly caused by bupropion according to its adverse reaction postmarketing experience). The association is therefore recognized, but due to the low frequency of the event, the causal relationship might not be as clearly defined as with other, more common adverse reactions.

Clinical Trials Experience (section 6.1) does not specifically list myocardial infarction as a common finding. The most common adverse reactions stated include agitation, dry mouth, constipation, headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, excessive sweating, tremor, insomnia, blurred vision, tachycardia, confusion, rash, hostility, cardiac arrhythmias, and auditory disturbance.

The Postmarketing Experience section (6.2) does list myocardial infarction under cardiovascular adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of bupropion, which indicates that these events have been reported once the drug was available on the market to a broader population.

In summary, although myocardial infarction has been reported in patients taking bupropion, it is considered a rare adverse event, and thus the evidence of a causal relationship with bupropion is weaker than for those adverse reactions that are more frequently reported. When considering this potential adverse effect in a clinical setting, healthcare providers need to consider individual patient risk factors for myocardial infarction and monitor patients accordingly.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,buspirone,,"Summary of Evidence:

The drug label for buspirone hydrochloride tablets provides detailed information on adverse reactions observed during clinical trials, as well as post-marketing experience. The label reports that during the premarketing assessment of buspirone, which involved over 3500 subjects, various adverse events were reported. However, the causal relationship of these events to buspirone treatment could not always be determined due to the lack of appropriate controls in some studies.

Regarding cardiovascular adverse events, the drug label categorizes their frequency as follows:

1. Frequent (≥1/100 patients): nonspecific chest pain.
2. Infrequent (1/100 to 1/1000 patients): syncope, hypotension, and hypertension.
3. Rare (<1/1000 patients): cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction (acute myocardial infarction), cardiomyopathy, and bradycardia.

Among these cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction is mentioned as a rare adverse reaction to buspirone. However, it is important to note that because of the spontaneous nature of post-marketing reports and the lack of controlled data, establishing a definite causal relationship between buspirone and myocardial infarction is challenging.

In controlled clinical trials, the label does not specifically cite acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse event, nor does it appear in the list of common events leading to discontinuation of buspirone during the trials. The more common cardiovascular-related events during trials were tachycardia/palpitations, which were reported at an equal frequency of 1% for both buspirone and placebo groups.

Given the data provided in the drug label, the occurrence of myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to buspirone is categorized as rare based on post-marketing reports. There is no definitive evidence from controlled clinical trials to establish acute myocardial infarction as a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to buspirone.

acute myocardial infarction,candesartan,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for candesartan, there is no direct evidence explicitly linking candesartan use to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of therapy in adults with hypertension included headache (0.6%) and dizziness (0.3%), and among heart failure patients, adverse events such as hypotension (4.1%), abnormal renal function (6.3%), and hyperkalemia (2.4%) were noted.

Postmarketing experiences listed various adverse reactions, but there was no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction. The listed reactions in the postmarketing experience include digestive, hematologic, immunologic, metabolic and nutritional disorders, respiratory system disorders, and skin and appendages disorders. Rhabdomyolysis was a rare report mentioned in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers, a class of drugs that includes candesartan.

It's important to recognize that postmarketing surveillance might not capture all adverse reactions, particularly if they are rare or have a delayed onset. However, based on the information provided, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a known adverse reaction to candesartan in the clinical studies experience, nor in the postmarketing experience as per the provided drug label sections.

To ensure a comprehensive analysis, a search for the latest evidence in scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and updated postmarketing surveillance reports would be necessary. Without such data, we cannot definitively conclude if there is a link between candesartan and acute myocardial infarction. Based on the information presented, no known evidence supports this relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,captopril,,"The provided drug label sections for captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, list various adverse reactions observed during clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and other reports. According to the information provided, myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is reported as having occurred in approximately 2 to 3 out of 1000 patients.

While this data indicates there have been some instances of acute myocardial infarction during captopril use, the frequency appears to be relatively low (2-3 per 1000 patients), and the relationship to the drug is characterized as uncertain. This suggests that while there is a temporal association, causality may not be firmly established. Thus, it's important to consider these occurrences within the context of the overall population risk for MI and to understand that patients taking captopril may have underlying conditions that predispose them to cardiovascular events, which could contribute to the reported incidence of MI.

The evidence does not provide a conclusive link between captopril exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. Moreover, the drug label information states that the relationship to drug use is uncertain, indicating a lack of strong evidence supporting a direct causal relationship.

In summary, there have been rare reports of myocardial infarction in patients taking captopril, but the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance as summarized on the drug label does not firmly establish captopril as a cause of myocardial infarction. As with other medications, it is critical for healthcare providers to weigh the benefits of captopril against any potential risks, including cardiovascular events, and to monitor patients accordingly.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction is mentioned to have occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients during captopril therapy. However, this statistical occurrence does not provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and captopril. Given that acute myocardial infarction is listed under adverse reactions, there is an implication that there may be a possible association; therefore, no evidence is provided to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and captopril exposure. To refute the relationship, one would need specific data or studies indicating that the occurrence of acute myocardial infarctions in patients taking captopril is not higher than the incidence seen in a similar population not exposed to the drug, which is not provided in the drug label information."
acute myocardial infarction,carbamazepine,,"The provided drug label sections for carbamazepine do not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a known adverse reaction. The cardiovascular system adverse reactions mentioned include congestive heart failure, edema, aggravation of hypertension, hypotension, syncope and collapse, aggravation of coronary artery disease, arrhythmias and AV block, thrombophlebitis, thromboembolism, and lymphadenopathy. However, the label does note that myocardial infarction has been associated with other tricyclic compounds, suggesting a class effect rather than a specific effect of carbamazepine.

Carbamazepine is a tricyclic compound, and while the drug label signals an association between myocardial infarction and other tricyclic compounds, the evidence of a direct relationship between AMI and carbamazepine is not specifically established in the label's information. For a definitive assessment, a systematic review of the literature, including clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, would be necessary.

If there were trials or case reports linking carbamazepine to AMI, they would typically be identified through a detailed literature review. In the absence of such information in the provided label sections and without access to external resources, we cannot conclusively state there is a relationship between AMI and carbamazepine use. Therefore, while we can hypothesize a potential association due to its tricyclic structure, without direct evidence, we must state that the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and carbamazepine is not clearly supported by the data provided in the label.

Clinicians are advised to consider the entire profile of a medication, including known pharmacology, reported adverse reactions, and clinical experience, when determining the risks and benefits of a medication for a specific patient. They should also remain vigilant for and report any suspected adverse reactions to relevant pharmacovigilance bodies to contribute to the global understanding of a drug's safety.","Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an observed adverse reaction to carbamazepine. The label does mention cardiovascular complications, including congestive heart failure, edema, aggravation of hypertension, hypotension, syncope and collapse, aggravation of coronary artery disease, arrhythmias and AV block, thrombophlebitis, and thromboembolism, some of which have resulted in fatalities. However, myocardial infarction is specifically mentioned in the context that it has been associated with other tricyclic compounds, not carbamazepine itself.

Given the absence of evidence linking carbamazepine with acute myocardial infarction within the provided label information, and the explicit association of myocardial infarction with other tricyclic compounds rather than carbamazepine, it can be stated that there is no explicit evidence in the provided drug label supporting myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of carbamazepine. However, absence of evidence in the label does not equate to evidence of absence, and further lines of inquiry such as clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports would be necessary to make a definitive statement regarding such a relationship.

NA"
acute myocardial infarction,carbidopa,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as one of the potential adverse reactions when carbidopa is used in conjunction with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products. However, it is essential to note that the evidence does not directly link carbidopa alone to the occurrence of AMI. The evidence seems to suggest that the risk of AMI is associated with the concomitant use of carbidopa with other drugs such as levodopa, rather than carbidopa alone.

In this context, no specific data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance have been provided that isolates carbidopa as the direct cause of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, while AMI is mentioned as an adverse event in the broader context of carbidopa's use with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination therapies, there is no provided evidence that establishes a direct causal relationship between AMI and carbidopa monotherapy.

Given the complexity of pharmacovigilance and the evaluation of adrenergic reactions, it is possible that the listing of AMI as an adverse reaction may be based on observations from post-marketing surveillance where direct causality is difficult to establish. Patients taking carbidopa in combination with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products may have underlying conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, which could also independently increase the risk of cardiovascular events like AMI.

To conclude, while acute myocardial infarction is mentioned among potential adverse reactions to treatment with carbidopa in combination with other drugs, we do not have evidence from the provided label sections to support a direct causal relationship between AMI and the use of carbidopa alone. For a definitive assessment of this potential adverse reaction, a thorough review of clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports specifically examining the effects of carbidopa monotherapy would be required.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,carfilzomib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exposure to carfilzomib (Kyprolis) can be summarized from various sources detailed in package labeling, including clinical trial experiences, post-marketing surveillance, and adverse event reporting.

**Clinical Trials:**
- In the ASPIRE trial, which evaluated carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd), deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose in the KRd arm occurred in 12% of patients. The most frequent causes of death were infection, cardiac, and other adverse reactions, with cardiac causes accounting for 10 out of 392 patients (3%) in the KRd arm.
- The serious adverse reactions reported in the KRd arm included myocardial infarction, occurring in 0.8% of patients.
- The ENDEAVOR trial, evaluating carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd), reported deaths within 30 days of the last treatment due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients in the Kd arm, with cardiac causes accounting for 4 out of 463 patients (1%) in the Kd arm.
- Cardiac failure events had an incidence of 11% in the Kd arm.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
- The label mentions that cardiac toxicities, such as heart failure, ischemia, and myocardial infarction, some of which have been fatal, have been reported following administration of carfilzomib.
- Fatal adverse reactions due to cardiac causes, within a day of carfilzomib administration, have been reported in post-marketing surveillance.

**Adverse Reactions and Warnings Sections:**
- Section 5.1 of the warning cautions about cardiac toxicities, urging monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiac failure or ischemia and taking appropriate measures including withholding carfilzomib if necessary.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggests that there is an association between carfilzomib and an increased risk of cardiac adverse events, including acute myocardial infarction. This relationship is further supported by specific mentions in the warnings and precautions section of the drug label. Health professionals are advised to monitor patients closely for symptoms of cardiac toxicity and to take appropriate measures if such toxicities are suspected.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,carfilzomib,,"Summary of Evidence:

Carfilzomib, marketed under the brand name Kyprolis, is a proteasome inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The drug label includes a range of adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions, noteworthy amongst which is the position of cardiac toxicities, covered under section 5.1 of the Warnings and Precautions.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
Cardiac toxicities associated with the use of Carfilzomib have been documented in several clinical trials. The adverse reactions mentioned range from cardiac failure to myocardial infarction, some of which have been fatal. The ASPIRE trial, where patients were treated with a combination of Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone (KRd), showed that cardiac events led to death within 30 days of the last dose in 10 (3%) KRd-treated patients versus 9 (2%) Rd (Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone alone)-treated patients. Similarly, the ENDEAVOR trial, comparing Carfilzomib with Dexamethasone (Kd) against Bortezomib with Dexamethasone (Vd), showed a higher incidence of deaths due to cardiac events in the Kd arm (4 [1%]) compared to the Vd arm (5 [1%]). Moreover, cardiac failure events occurred in 7% of the KRd arm versus 4% in the Rd arm, and in 11% in the Kd arm versus 3% in the Vd arm.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing reports have also indicated the occurrence of cardiac events, but it's important to note that these events are voluntarily reported and not always proven to be directly related to drug exposure.

Assessment and Mechanism of Action:
Carfilzomib is known to inhibit the proteasome, which may affect cardiac function by disrupting the proteostasis, potentially leading to cell stress and death. Given the mechanism of action and the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, there is a clear association between Carfilzomib and cardiac adverse events, such as heart failure and myocardial infarction.

Recommendations:
Patients treated with Carfilzomib should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of cardiac toxicity, and if cardiac toxicity is suspected, the treatment should be withheld and a thorough evaluation is recommended. Appropriate dose modifications or discontinuation should be considered based on the severity of the cardiac adverse event and the overall benefit-risk assessment for the individual patient. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or those with risk factors for cardiac disease should be assessed carefully before initiating treatment with Carfilzomib. 

Conclusion:
In summary, evidence from both clinical trials and post-marketing reports supports a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and Carfilzomib exposure. Mitigation strategies involve monitoring for cardiac events and adjusting therapy as necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,carvedilol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for carvedilol, there is no direct evidence cited that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an adverse reaction of carvedilol in the context of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The sections detail various adverse reactions encountered during clinical studies and post-marketing experience, but AMI is not listed as one of them.

Carvedilol is a medication primarily used to treat heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction, and hypertension. The adverse reactions listed under section 6.1 for carvedilol include dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, asthenia, bradycardia, weight increase, and more for patients with heart failure. For patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, identified in the CAPRICORN trial, the most common adverse events were consistent with the drug's known profile (e.g., dyspnea, anemia, and lung edema). Although the adverse events section does mention that carvedilol has been evaluated in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction, it does not cite AMI as a potential adverse reaction of drug exposure.

Warnings about the use of carvedilol include the potential for exacerbation of coronary artery disease upon cessation of therapy, bradycardia, hypotension, and fluid retention leading to worsening heart failure (sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4). However, these do not assert that carvedilol directly causes AMI.

Based on the available label information, there is no reported evidence to support a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and carvedilol as an adverse drug reaction. If concerns about such a relationship are based on individual case reports or observational data not included in the label, a review of the scientific literature and databases of adverse drug reactions would be necessary to explore this further.

It is important to note that the absence of evidence in the label does not conclusively rule out the possibility, as post-marketing surveillance can occasionally reveal rare but serious adverse reactions not detected in clinical trials. Health care providers report these rare occurrences to regulatory bodies such as the FDA via systems like FDA MedWatch.

Always consult with health care professionals or pharmacovigilance sources for the most updated information on drug safety and to report any suspected adverse reactions.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,caspofungin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for CANCIDAS (caspofungin acetate), there is no explicit mention or direct association between acute myocardial infarction and caspofungin exposure in the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings sections. The label does mention cardiac disorders and includes tachycardia as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, but acute myocardial infarction is listed only under “Clinically significant adverse reactions, regardless of causality or incidence which occurred in less than 5% of patients.” This suggests that if acute myocardial infarction has occurred, it was infrequent and not established to be causally associated with caspofungin.

Here is a summary of the evidence regarding acute myocardial infarction based on the provided drug label:

- Acute myocardial infarction is listed in the section detailing clinically significant adverse reactions that occurred in less than 5% of patients. This indicates rare occurrences of this reaction among patient populations in clinical trials, without a clear causal relationship.
- The label does not mention acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction, nor is it highlighted in the box warnings or warnings and precautions sections, which would be expected if it were a recognized and significant risk associated with the drug.
- The label includes other cardiac disorders like tachycardia and hypotension in the sections with a higher incidence of adverse reactions, but without a direct link to acute myocardial infarction.

Based on the standard for drug labels to report known and significant adverse reactions and considering that acute myocardial infarction is not prominently featured, the evidence to support a strong correlation between caspofungin and acute myocardial infarction is weak or non-conclusive as presented in the label. 

A definitive conclusion on the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and caspofungin would require review of peer-reviewed studies, clinical trial data, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data beyond the drug label. However, based on the provided information, there is no strong evidence supporting a conclusive link.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cefdinir,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned as one of the adverse events reported post-marketing for cefdinir. While the clinical trials involving cefdinir (both in adult/adolescent patients and pediatric patients) list various adverse events and laboratory changes, acute myocardial infarction is not listed among the reported side effects within those trials. Instead, the notation of AMI appears in the context of the postmarketing experience, which encompasses adverse events that have been reported after the drug has been approved and is on the market, collected from a broader and more diverse population.

The postmarketing surveillance data provided lists myocardial infarction as one of many adverse events reported. It is important to note that postmarketing reports are not always a direct reflection of a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, as these reports can include coincidental occurrences and are not always substantiated by controlled studies. No specific incidence rate or detailed circumstances surrounding the onset of myocardial infarction post-cefdinir exposure are provided, and there is no mention of a ""Boxed Warning"" or specific ""Warnings"" section related to AMI in the context of cefdinir use.

Given the nature of postmarketing data, which can vary widely in quality and does not necessarily establish causation, the relationship between cefdinir and acute myocardial infarction cannot be conclusively determined from the information provided. There appears to be no strong evidence from clinical trials to support a direct link, and the postmarketing report alone does not suffice to establish causation. Further investigation, such as epidemiological studies or case reports that thoroughly assess and control for confounding factors, would be necessary to better understand and evaluate any potential causal relationship between cefdinir use and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction.","Based on the provided drug label information, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, is not listed as a common adverse reaction to cefdinir in either adult/adolescent or pediatric patients. The adverse events reported in clinical trials and post-marketing experience primarily include gastrointestinal disturbances, rash, and changes in laboratory values, among others.

The postmarketing experience does mention myocardial infarction; however, the context does not establish a direct causative link with cefdinir but rather lists it among various adverse experiences reported without specifying the frequency or establishing a definitive relationship to the drug.

Therefore, based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no direct evidence to support that acute myocardial infarction is an established adverse reaction to cefdinir. It is essential to review all available data, including clinical research, case reports, and epidemiological studies, for a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between AMI and cefdinir. However, this information is not included in the provided text, and further investigation would be required to conclusively refute such a relationship. If such data is absent or shows no association, it can be stated that there is no known evidence linking cefdinir to acute myocardial infarction."
acute myocardial infarction,cefiderocol,,"Based on the sections provided from the drug label of cefiderocol (FETROJA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under cardiac disorders as an adverse reaction that occurred at a rate of less than 4% in FETROJA-treated patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) during clinical trial 2. This information suggests that there have been cases where patients treated with cefiderocol experienced AMI, though the incidence appears to be low.

However, the causal relationship between cefiderocol and acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly established. The evidence comes from an active-controlled clinical trial (Trial 2). Further information, such as patient characteristics, underlying risk factors, comparative frequency versus control treatments, and the context of illness severity, would be required to fully understand the nature of these reported AMIs.

The sections provided do not mention AMI in the context of the most common adverse reactions or in the Boxed Warnings and Precautions sections, which suggests that AMI is not among the most frequently observed adverse reactions nor an identified risk that has led to an explicit warning in the label. The lack of emphasis in these sections may imply that while occurrences of AMI have been noted, they have not been a prominent or consistent concern in the overall safety profile of the drug based on available clinical trial data.

In post-marketing surveillance, pharmaceutical companies and regulatory bodies such as the FDA monitor adverse events reported by healthcare professionals and patients. However, from the information provided, there are no specific mentions of post-marketing data regarding the occurrence of AMI in patients taking cefiderocol.

For a comprehensive safety assessment of cefiderocol and to definitively establish the relationship between cefiderocol and acute myocardial infarction, further investigation through post-marketing studies, additional clinical data, and detailed case reports would be necessary. It is crucial for healthcare providers to report any suspected adverse reactions to regulatory authorities to aid in this assessment.

In conclusion, there is some evidence from a clinical trial indicating that AMI has occurred in patients treated with cefiderocol, though the information does not establish a clear causal relationship, and the available evidence suggests a relatively low incidence rate. Without more detailed data or reports from post-marketing surveillance, a definitive assessment cannot be made. Healthcare professionals should continue to monitor patient outcomes and report adverse events related to cefiderocol use to contribute to the understanding of its safety profile.","Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and cefiderocol (marketed as FETROJA). The adverse reactions section of the drug label, which details the findings from clinical trials, mentions cardiac disorders that include myocardial infarction but does not quantitatively assert the lack of association between cefiderocol and acute myocardial infarction.

From Trial 2, which involved patients with Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP), myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse reaction occurring at a rate of less than 4% in FETROJA-treated HABP/VABP patients. However, no specific quantitative comparison or statistical analysis is provided to confirm that the observed myocardial infarctions were unrelated to cefiderocol treatment.

Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of cefiderocol, given the available evidence does not specifically refute the association. It is important to consider that the occurrence of myocardial infarction could be related to underlying conditions in the patient population studied, and without controlled studies specifically looking at this outcome, causality cannot be determined. Further evidence, such as detailed clinical study results or post-marketing surveillance data, would be required to clarify the relationship, if any, between acute myocardial infarction and cefiderocol exposure."
acute myocardial infarction,cefuroxime,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cefuroxime, acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction is not listed among the most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (Section 6.1). The typical adverse reactions reported in clinical trials with cefuroxime axetil include diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, and vaginitis in patients treated for early Lyme disease. Other less common reactions include eosinophilia, transient elevations in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH), and other minor symptoms such as rash, itch, or headache.

However, in Section 6.2, which outlines post-marketing experience, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction is mentioned as part of an allergic reaction. It should be noted that post-marketing reports are voluntary and the frequency of such reactions cannot be reliably estimated. Furthermore, the causal relationship to drug exposure is not clear due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the uncertain size of the population.

Additionally, in Section 5.1, anaphylactic reactions are described as serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity outcomes associated with the use of β-lactam antibacterials, including cefuroxime axetil. It is within the context of these anaphylactic reactions that acute myocardial ischemia or infarction could occur, albeit rarely.

To summarize, while acute myocardial infarction is not among the commonly reported adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials with cefuroxime axetil, it has been identified as a possible severe outcome associated with an allergic reaction in the post-marketing experience. This linkage is not characterized by a frequency nor is a direct causal relationship established. Therefore, while there is mention of an association between cefuroxime axetil use and acute myocardial infarction, the evidence is derived from post-marketing surveillance, which is less robust than data from randomized controlled trials.","Based on the provided sections of the cefuroxime drug label, acute myocardial infarction is mentioned under “Postmarketing Experience” as a potential adverse reaction that ""may occur as part of an allergic reaction."" However, the nature of postmarketing surveillance (voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size) means that the evidence for causality, as implied by the drug label, is not as strong as evidence derived from controlled clinical trials. The statement does not necessarily refute or confirm the relationship, but rather indicates that there have been reports, without enough data to estimate the frequency or establish a confirmed causal relationship.

For a more definitive statement refuting the relationship between cefuroxime exposure and acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction, evidence from controlled clinical trials, large-scale observational studies, or comprehensive meta-analyses would be needed, none of which is provided in the drug label extract.

In the absence of specific evidence clearly refuting the relationship between cefuroxime and acute myocardial infarction, it cannot be definitively stated that there is no association. However, this does not affirm that an association exists, only that specific refuting evidence is not included or indicated in the provided information.

""NA"" is not an appropriate response in this context, as the label does mention acute myocardial infarction, albeit within the limits of postmarketing reports without definitive causal attribution."
acute myocardial infarction,celecoxib,,"The given sections from the drug label for celecoxib provide extensive details on various adverse reactions linked to the use of the drug. To focus on the specific inquiry regarding the evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and celecoxib exposure:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - In pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, AMI was listed as an adverse reaction under the ""Cardiovascular"" category occurring between 0.1% to 1.9% in patients treated with celecoxib. This places AMI as an observed adverse event, but the indication of such events in less than 2% of patients does not establish a definitive causal relationship.

2. The APC and PreSAP Trials:
   - In the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial, there was a threefold increased risk of a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke for celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and celecoxib 200 mg twice daily treatment arms compared to placebo.
   - Specifically, the increased incidence of myocardial infarction contributed to the elevated risk, which directly implicates celecoxib as a potential factor in the occurrence of AMI.

3. Post-Market Experience:
   - AMI is identified as an adverse reaction during the post-approval use of celecoxib. However, data on frequency are not available due to voluntary reporting.

4. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events:
   - Clinical trials with COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have highlighted an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.
   - The drug label specifically warns of an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, particularly at higher doses or with longer duration of use.

5. PRECISION Trial:
   - A randomized controlled trial named PRECISION compared the cardiovascular thrombotic risk of celecoxib against non-selective NSAIDs (naproxen and ibuprofen).
   - Celecoxib at 100 mg twice daily was found to be non-inferior to naproxen and ibuprofen for a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

Overall, the evidence supports a relationship between the use of celecoxib and the risk of acute myocardial infarction, especially highlighted in long-term studies like the APC trial and acknowledged in the warning regarding cardiovascular thrombotic events. The PRECISION trial also provides comparative data suggesting that celecoxib may have a similar risk profile for cardiovascular events compared to non-selective NSAIDs. However, the occurrence of AMI is dose-dependent and appears more frequently with higher dosages and longer-term use, emphasizing the importance of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible to minimize risk.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ceritinib,,"Based on the information provided from the sections of the drug label for ceritinib (ZYKADIA), the evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure is mentioned in the context of fatal adverse reactions. Specifically, acute myocardial infarction is listed among the fatal adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA in the ASCEND-4 clinical trial, which was an open-label, randomized, active-controlled multicenter study of 376 previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients.

It's important to note that the occurrence of myocardial infarction is mentioned in the same list as respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, and an unknown cause, indicating that these events were observed during the clinical study. However, the incidence rate or the direct causal relationship is not explicitly stated, and the clinical significance of the finding in the broader treated population isn't adequately described, implying that such reactions may be rare.

No additional details are provided about the rates of acute myocardial infarction or its possible mechanisms. Furthermore, it is not specified whether acute myocardial infarction was observed in clinical settings other than this trial, such as in other studies or in post-marketing surveillance. The lack of detailed quantitative data on the relationship between ceritinib exposure and acute myocardial infarction suggests that this adverse effect might not be common, but healthcare providers should be aware of its potential occurrence.

As with all drug-related adverse effects, it is crucial to consider the overall risk-benefit profile of ceritinib in the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction, considering the seriousness of such an adverse reaction. The recommendation for healthcare providers is to be vigilant and report suspicious cases to appropriate drug safety surveillance systems, as individual case studies and post-marketing reports can further clarify the causality and incidence rates for adverse reactions like myocardial infarction associated with ceritinib.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ceritinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ceritinib exposure is derived from clinical trial data as mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label for ceritinib (brand name ZYKADIA). Ceritinib is a medication indicated for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly among those who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib.

According to the adverse reactions section from the ASCEND-4 clinical trial, which was a randomized, active-controlled multicenter study of 376 previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients, the following fatal adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA (ceritinib) at a dose of 750 mg daily under fasted conditions: myocardial infarction, respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, and unknown cause. It is crucial to note that myocardial infarction was listed as one of the fatal adverse reactions.

This clinical trial evidence indicates that there have been instances of AMI in patients taking ceritinib. However, the specific incidence rate of AMI and the strength of the relationship between ceritinib exposure and the occurrence of AMI are not detailed in the provided information. Furthermore, the circumstances under which these events occurred (e.g., patient risk factors, timing relative to drug exposure) are not described in the label excerpt provided.

To accurately assess the causality and to fully establish the connection between ceritinib and AMI, more detailed information from the clinical trial data, including the number of AMI events compared to a control group (if available), and consideration of confounding factors, would be essential.

In cases of post-marketing surveillance and case studies, the provided drug label does not mention these sources. Therefore, we have no evidence from these specific areas to further support or refute a relationship between ceritinib and acute myocardial infarction aside from what has been observed in clinical trial settings.

In summary, there is evidence from a clinical trial (ASCEND-4) that acute myocardial infarction occurred as a fatal adverse reaction in patients treated with ceritinib. Nevertheless, the label data does not provide complete information on the incidence or the relative risk of AMI compared to controls not exposed to ceritinib. For robust risk assessment, further details such as patient risk factors, the statistical significance of the observed rates of AMI, and additional post-marketing data would be necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,certolizumab pegol,,"Summary of Evidence:

Certolizumab pegol, marketed as CIMZIA, is a medication used to treat various chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis. Here is a concise summary of the evidence concerning the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with certolizumab pegol based on clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance:

Clinical Trials: 
Evidence from premarketing controlled trials does not list acute myocardial infarction directly as a common adverse reaction (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience). The most common adverse reactions in these trials were upper respiratory infections, rash, and urinary tract infection. More detailed adverse reaction rates from controlled trials with Crohn's disease and RA mention cardiac disorders among other serious or significant adverse reactions, with instances of myocardial infarction listed among them. However, specific incidence rates or direct association of AMI with certolizumab pegol use are not quantified here (Other Adverse Reactions).

Post-marketing Surveillance:
There is evidence from post-marketing experience that includes myocardial infarction as one of the reported cardiac disorders in individuals treated with certolizumab pegol (Other Adverse Reactions). The incidence rates or causality are not specified in this context. 

Warnings and Precautions:
Within sections 5 of Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.11), there is acknowledgment of serious cardiac events such as heart failure in patients treated with CIMZIA, and the need to monitor these patients carefully (5.3 Heart Failure). While this does not directly reference acute myocardial infarction, it alludes to the recognition of cardiovascular risks with TNF blockers, which is the class of drugs to which certolizumab pegol belongs.

Summary:
Acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a most common adverse reaction in the controlled clinical trials for certolizumab pegol (CIMZIA). However, myocardial infarction is included in the range of possible cardiac disorders experienced by patients treated with the drug, as evidenced by the data from clinical trials and post-marketing reports. The labeling advises caution regarding cardiac events in patients who are treated with CIMZIA, suggesting a potential relationship between drug exposure and cardiovascular risks, albeit without providing specific data on the incidence of AMI. Overall, there appears to be a recognition of the potential for serious cardiac adverse events associated with certolizumab pegol, but evidence of a direct causal relationship between certolizumab pegol and acute myocardial infarction specifically requires more comprehensive data.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,certolizumab pegol,,"Based on the provided drug label information for certolizumab pegol (CIMZIA), there is evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an identified adverse reaction associated with its use. Specifically:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- AMI is listed as a cardiac disorder adverse reaction in controlled and uncontrolled studies for diseases treated with CIMZIA. It is mentioned alongside adverse reactions such as angina pectoris, arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and myocardial ischemia.

Other Adverse Reactions:
- Under section 6.1 of the adverse reactions, among the ""Other serious or significant adverse reactions reported in controlled and uncontrolled studies in Crohn's disease and other diseases,"" myocardial infarction is specifically listed as a cardiac disorder.

Postmarketing Experience:
- Although not explicitly mentioned in the context of postmarketing surveillance in the provided sections, postmarketing experiences often provide real-world evidence and surveillance data beyond the controlled environment of clinical trials. As such, additional cases or reports relevant to AMI may be collected through this mechanism.

Considering the nature of this medication, it is important to understand that certolizumab pegol, like other TNF blockers, can have significant effects on the immune system, which may indirectly influence cardiovascular risk or contribute to adverse events such as myocardial infarction. However, the incidence and causality relationships derived from trials and post-marketing experiences are not detailed in the provided sections of the drug label.

It is also important to note that adverse reactions observed in clinical trials may not always predict the rates observed in broader patient populations in clinical practice. Given the information provided, it's recommended that healthcare professionals be aware of the potential for AMI as an adverse reaction associated with the use of certolizumab pegol. Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of a cardiac event, especially if they have underlying risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

To further evaluate the specific risk of AMI with certolizumab pegol use, one would typically review the actual data from clinical trials, the frequencies of such events in comparison to control groups, and any data available from post-marketing reports, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of this potential adverse reaction.

For more detailed information, please consult the full prescribing information or contact the manufacturer, UCB, Inc., and consider checking peer-reviewed medical literature and databases for additional studies or case reports regarding this matter.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cetuximab,,"Upon review of the provided cetuximab (Erbitux) label sections, the evidence for a direct relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cetuximab exposure is not explicitly provided in the label sections mentioned. While cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death has occurred in patients treated with cetuximab, specifically in combination with radiation therapy or platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil (as mentioned in the Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions - Section 5.2), acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction is not listed separately in the clinical trials experience or in the postmarketing surveillance data provided.

The label mentions that cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death occurred in 2% of patients receiving cetuximab with radiation therapy in a head and neck cancer clinical trial (BONNER), and some of these events were presumed due to myocardial infarction. Additionally, the EXTREME trial showed that fatal cardiac disorders or sudden death occurred in 3% of patients when cetuximab was used with platinum-based therapy and fluorouracil.

These findings suggest there could be cardiovascular risks associated with cetuximab, especially when used in combination with other therapies, but they do not specifically denote AMI as an adverse reaction of cetuximab monotherapy. Furthermore, the label also advises considering the use of cetuximab in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias given the observed clinical trial events (Section 5.2).

To summarize, while there is evidence of cardiopulmonary adverse events, including fatal events that could be related to myocardial infarction, in certain patient populations treated with cetuximab, the label does not explicitly list AMI as a labeled adverse reaction from cetuximab exposure based on the information provided. To further establish a clear causal relationship between AMI and cetuximab exposure, additional investigations such as targeted post-marketing studies, case reports with a clear temporal relationship, and mechanistic studies would be needed.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cevimeline,,"Based on the provided sections (adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings) of the drug label for cevimeline, there is mention of myocardial infarction under cardiovascular disorders within the ""adverse reactions"" section; however, it is categorized under events that occurred rarely (<1%) in treated Sjögren's patients. Furthermore, the label specifies that the causal relationship is unknown, indicating that while myocardial infarction has been reported, a direct link to cevimeline use has not been established.

There is no evidence from the provided information that acute myocardial infarction is a characteristic or common adverse reaction of cevimeline, nor is there a specified incidence rate from clinical trials. In clinical trials, the most prominently reported adverse events were related to muscarinic agonism (e.g., excessive sweating, nausea, rhinitis, diarrhea, etc.). Cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction appeared to be rare and not conclusively attributable to the drug.

Furthermore, there is no specific mention of myocardial infarction in the ""POST-MARKETING ADVERSE EVENTS"" section, which implies that there hasn't been a notable pattern observed in the post-market surveillance to suggest a strong association.

To summarize, while there has been a rare instance of myocardial infarction reported in patients treated with cevimeline, no substantial evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance has been presented to firmly establish a causal relationship. The significance of the finding of myocardial infarction in relation to cevimeline therapy is unknown, and more research would be required to assess any possible connection. Health professionals rely on further post-marketing surveillance and research studies to monitor and understand the implications of such rare adverse events.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cilostazol,,"Based on the information provided from the sections of the drug label for cilostazol, the evidence for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to cilostazol is not explicitly detailed in the common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2% incidence). However, in the section listing clinical significant adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency less than 2% in the 100 mg twice daily group, myocardial infarction is mentioned.

Additionally, the warning sections of the label indicate that patients with a history of ischemic heart disease might be at risk for exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. This suggests a recognition of the potential for cardiac-related adverse effects, including AMI, particularly in the predisposed population.

Furthermore, the label indicates that postmarketing experience, which encompasses voluntary reports from patients after the drug has been approved and is in use by the general population, has identified cardiac disorders as adverse reactions. However, specific mention of AMI is not made under postmarketing experience.

In the context of this summary:

- **Clinical Trials Evidence**: AMI is listed as a less frequent (<2%) but clinically significant adverse reaction in controlled clinical trials of cilostazol.
- **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: While cardiac disorders are mentioned, acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly reported as an identified adverse reaction in postmarketing surveillance according to the provided sections of the label.
- **Warnings**: In patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, there's a warning about the risk of exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is not prominent among the most common adverse reactions of cilostazol, there is evidence from clinical trials suggesting a potential association. This is further supported by the warnings for patients with ischemic heart disease, indicating a possible increased risk of cardiac complications, including AMI. However, definitive causality and incidence rates cannot be ascertained solely based on this data and would require a more detailed assessment considering full clinical trial results and comprehensive analysis of postmarketing data.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ciprofloxacin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ciprofloxacin, acute myocardial infarction is listed as a medically important adverse reaction that occurred in less than 1% of ciprofloxacin patients. This information is derived from clinical trials experience, indicating that during clinical investigations with oral and parenteral ciprofloxacin involving 49,038 patients, myocardial infarction was reported as an adverse event.

It is important to note that the occurrence of this adverse event is rare and the data suggest it is not a common reaction to ciprofloxacin. However, the mention of myocardial infarction in the adverse reactions section implies that there has been at least some evidence to suggest a possible relationship between ciprofloxacin use and the occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction.

The drug label does not detail any specific cases, nor does it quantify the risk or provide a mechanism by which ciprofloxacin might lead to a myocardial infarction. Additionally, there is no indication in the provided drug label sections that acute myocardial infarction is considered a common or well-characterized adverse reaction of ciprofloxacin.

For a comprehensive safety profile, it would be necessary to review more detailed safety data from the clinical trials, as well as post-marketing surveillance reports, including the frequency of this event and any potential risk factors identified.

In summary, the evidence linking ciprofloxacin to the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction is limited, based on its listing as an adverse event in a clinical trial setting occurring in less than 1% of patients, without in-depth elaboration in the provided drug label sections.

Additional sources, including detailed clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance reports, would be necessary to adequately evaluate the strength of the evidence regarding this potential association. As with any adverse drug reaction, healthcare professionals should report occurrences of myocardial infarction in patients taking ciprofloxacin to the relevant drug safety authorities to further assess causality.","The provided drug label sections primarily list various adverse reactions associated with ciprofloxacin, including disabling and potentially irreversible adverse reactions like tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned in the ""Medically Important Adverse Reactions That Occurred in less than 1% of Ciprofloxacin Patients"" under the ""Body as a Whole"" and ""Cardiovascular"" categories.

Given that AMI is listed as an adverse reaction that occurred in less than 1% of patients, the evidence provided in the drug label does not refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and ciprofloxacin exposure. Instead, it acknowledges that AMI has been reported in a small number of patients taking ciprofloxacin.

The evidence needed to refute a causal relationship would likely come from large-scale epidemiological studies, clinical trials, or meta-analyses demonstrating no statistically significant association between AMI and ciprofloxacin use when compared to controls. Such studies would need to account for confounding factors and biases that could affect the observed outcomes.

Since the data presented in the drug label does not refute the relationship but actually notes that acute myocardial infarction has been observed, albeit infrequently, the response to the question of evidence refuting the relationship between AMI and ciprofloxacin exposure is ""NA"". The drug label indicates that there is a potential association, but does not provide conclusive data about the frequency or causality of such an event. More extensive research would be necessary to establish or refute a causal link definitively."
acute myocardial infarction,cisplatin,,"The drug label provided for cisplatin lists several adverse reactions that have been observed in association with its administration. Among the cardiovascular disorders, myocardial infarction (acute heart attack) is mentioned as an adverse reaction identified from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. Specifically, it is mentioned in the section that details adverse reactions identified from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance, implying that the evidence for the association between acute myocardial infarction and cisplatin exposure may come from observations made during the post-approval use of the drug in the general population, rather than from pre-approval clinical trials.

It is important to note that the context in which myocardial infarction is mentioned does not provide details such as the incidence rate, the circumstances under which the adverse events occurred, or the proposed mechanisms by which cisplatin may contribute to the development of myocardial infarction. Typically, such details may be sparse in post-marketing reports, as they rely on healthcare professionals or patients reporting adverse effects that they suspect are related to a particular treatment. These reports are instrumental for ongoing pharmacovigilance and for assessing the risk-benefit profile of a medication after it has been brought to market.

Post-marketing surveillance is particularly important for understanding the full spectrum of a drug's potential adverse effects, as rare or long-term effects may not be fully captured during pre-approval clinical trials due to the limited number of participants and duration of these trials.

While the drug label confirms that acute myocardial infarction is an observed adverse reaction of cisplatin, further research such as epidemiological studies would be valuable to better understand the frequency, causation, and underlying biological mechanisms of this serious cardiovascular event in patients treated with cisplain. If additional information is needed, consulting the primary sources of post-marketing reports and any relevant literature or clinical studies would provide a more comprehensive evidence base to evaluate the relationship between cisplatin exposure and acute myocardial infarction.","Based on the information provided, acute myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse reaction to cisplatin under ""Cardiovascular disorders"" in the section detailing adverse reactions identified from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to state that there is no evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and cisplatin exposure; hence, the response ""NA"" (not applicable) indicating an absence of evidence refuting the relationship is not valid in this context. 

As an expert language model, my role is to provide summaries and evaluations based on the available data. In this case, the evidence from post-marketing surveillance as per the drug label indicates that acute myocardial infarction has been observed as an adverse reaction in the context of cisplatin treatment. Therefore, there is no existing evidence in the provided sections to suggest a refutation of the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and cisplatin exposure. 

Should more detailed investigation be needed to explore the causality, or lack thereof, between cisplatin and acute myocardial infarction, a thorough review of the literature including clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports, in addition to the pharmacovigilance data, would be necessary. However, such a detailed examination is beyond the scope of the immediate question and the information provided."
acute myocardial infarction,citalopram,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for citalopram, there is no direct mention of an association between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction specifically attributed to citalopram use. However, there is evidence presented in the label concerning the potential for QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes which are associated with an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia and sudden death.

The evidence described in the warning sections indicates that citalopram causes dose-dependent QTc prolongation, an ECG abnormality that has been associated with torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. This places patients with certain risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure at greater risk when using citalopram.

It is worth mentioning that the label advises caution in using citalopram with recent acute myocardial infarction because of the risk of QT prolongation. The product label reflects postmarketing experiences where torsade de pointes have occurred, and while myocardial infarction is listed under infrequent adverse reactions observed during premarketing evaluation, it is not clearly established as a direct adverse reaction to citalopram.

Therefore, while there is a well-established risk for QT-prolongation and its related cardiac arrhythmias, there is no explicit evidence in the label indicating that citalopram is directly associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. Additional independent sources beyond the drug label, such as clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports, would be required to validate such an association, which are not mentioned in the provided excerpt. If such evidence exists, it is not detailed in the current drug labeling information provided here.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,clevidipine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, the evidence regarding the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and clevidipine exposure can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
Clevidipine was evaluated in 19 studies with a total of 1406 exposures, which included both healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Within these studies, myocardial infarction was not listed among the most common adverse reactions (>2%) such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Specific information on the incidence of AMI during the perioperative hypertension studies (ESCAPE-1, ESCAPE-2, and ECLIPSE studies) was not provided as a commonly observed adverse event. It is noted, however, that the ability to differentiate the adverse event profile between treatments is limited due to the nature of the operative procedures.

Less Common Adverse Reactions:
Myocardial infarction was reported as a less common adverse reaction (<1%) in patients with severe or essential hypertension. This indicates that there have been rare instances of myocardial infarction reported during the use of clevidipine in these patient populations but does not necessarily establish a direct causal relationship.

Post-Marketing and Other Clinical Experience:
While post-marketing reports do not provide incidence rates or a causal relationship, myocardial infarction is not specifically listed among the identified adverse reactions in post-marketing surveillance.

Given the limited information available, no direct causal relationship between AMI and clevidipine can be concluded from the clinical trial data or the post-marketing experience provided. The mention of myocardial infarction as a less common adverse reaction in the context of severe or essential hypertension suggests that there may have been rare reports, but without further details on these cases, the relationship remains uncertain.

To reach a firm conclusion about the causal relationship between clevidipine and AMI, more data from robustly designed studies or detailed case reports with clear temporal association would be needed. It is also essential that healthcare professionals report and characterize any suspected adverse reactions to regulatory bodies to improve the understanding of drug safety profiles.","Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under ""Less Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe or Essential Hypertension"" following clevidipine administration. Specifically, AMI is stated as an adverse reaction reported in less than 1% of patients with severe or essential hypertension. The label notes that because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the ""Post-Marketing and Other Clinical Experience"" section, there is no mention of AMI as an identified adverse reaction during the post-approval use of clevidipine. Typically, if acute myocardial infarction were a common and significant adverse reaction identified post-marketing, it would have likely been listed in this section. Still, it is important to consider that post-marketing surveillance may not capture all instances or establish a definitive causal relationship due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertainty about the size of the exposed population.

There is no specific mention within the drug label sections provided that refutes the relationship between clevidipine and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction. However, the evidence provided does not indicate a strong causal relationship, as it is categorized under less common adverse reactions and has not been highlighted as a concern in post-marketing surveillance.

To arrive at a more conclusive statement, a comprehensive review of the current scientific literature, clinical study data, and detailed post-marketing surveillance reports would be required. If such a review suggests that AMI is not causally related to clevidipine based on the evidence, then the currently provided drug label information alone does not refute the relationship between the two. Therefore, without additional evidence specifically refuting or providing a clear characterization of the risk for AMI associated with clevidipine, the statement that there is evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of clevidipine is not substantiated based solely on the provided drug label information."
acute myocardial infarction,clevidipine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is limited information suggesting a direct relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the exposure to clevidipine. Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used for the management of hypertension, particularly in the perioperative setting or in severe hypertension cases. The summary of adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience with clevidipine does not list AMI as a common adverse reaction. Here are the details from the provided sections:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: In clinical trials involving 1406 exposures to clevidipine, common adverse reactions (>2%) included headache, nausea, and vomiting. In these trials, AMI is not mentioned as a common adverse event.

2. Less Common Adverse Reactions: AMI is cited as a less common adverse reaction in patients with severe or essential hypertension, occurring in <1% of patients. This suggests that while there were occurrences of myocardial infarction, they were infrequent among patients treated with clevidipine.

3. ECLIPSE Studies: In the ECLIPSE studies comparing clevidipine to other antihypertensive agents, no significant differentiation in adverse event profiles was noted specifically related to AMI. Moreover, no adverse reaction was more than 2% more common with clevidipine than with any of the comparators.

4. Post-Marketing Experience: The post-marketing data do not directly mention AMI as a reported adverse reaction. However, it is important to note that post-marketing adverse reaction reports are voluntary, and there is often insufficient information to establish a clear causal relationship between drug exposure and specific adverse events.

5. Warnings: The sections provided focus on other potential adverse effects such as hypotension, reflex tachycardia, negative inotropy (which can exacerbate heart failure), and the need for aseptic technique. None of the warnings specifically cite AMI as a potential consequence of clevidipine use.

In conclusion, based on the evidence provided, AMI appears to be a rare adverse reaction in the context of clevidipine use and is not highlighted as a major safety concern. However, given that AMI has been reported in rare cases, clinicians should remain vigilant and consider the patient's overall cardiovascular risk when administering this medication. Further post-market surveillance and research may be needed to clearly establish any potential relationship between clevidipine and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,clomipramine,,"The evidence provided in the drug label for clomipramine hydrochloride does not directly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction observed in the clinical studies cited. The most commonly reported adverse events include gastrointestinal complaints, nervous system complaints, genitourinary complaints, and other miscellaneous complaints such as sweating and visual changes.

However, within the ""Cardiovascular System"" category of adverse events observed in the premarketing evaluation of clomipramine hydrochloride, myocardial infarction is listed as a rare event, meaning it has occurred in less than 1/1,000 patients. This indicates that there have been reports of AMI during treatment with clomipramine, but the frequency is low. It's also important to note that although these events occurred during treatment, they were not necessarily caused by the drug.

Since the frequency of AMI in clomipramine hydrochloride users is very low, the label's information doesn't establish a strong, clear causal relationship between clomipramine exposure and acute myocardial infarction. The evidence characterized it as a rare event, and further investigation such as clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance would be required to determine a more definite relationship.

Additionally, the label provides no specific details from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance to quantitatively assess the risk of AMI in patients taking clomipramine hydrochloride. For a more conclusive statement on the relationship between clomipramine and acute myocardial infarction, a thorough review of post-marketing reports, clinical data, and any published literature on the subject would be necessary.

In conclusion, while acute myocardial infarction has been reported as a rare adverse event in patients treated with clomipramine hydrochloride, there isn't robust evidence presented in the drug label that would strongly establish AMI as a common or well-characterized risk of clomipramine use. Given the rarity of reported cases, if there is a risk, it appears to be low, and additional studies would be needed to clarify the significance of this finding.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,clozapine,,"Evidence supporting the association between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and clozapine use is primarily derived from post-marketing experience rather than from clinical trials or controlled studies. The drug label provided does not mention AMI as a commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical trials. Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥5% across clozapine tablet clinical trials include central nervous system reactions, cardiovascular reactions (such as tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope), autonomic nervous system reactions, gastrointestinal reactions, and fever. 

In the postmarketing experience section, it is noted that myocardial infarction has been identified as an adverse reaction. However, because these reports are voluntary from a population of uncertain size, the exact frequency and causal relationship to drug exposure are hard to establish reliably.

Additional evidence from the warnings and precautions section of the label mentions myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, which are related cardiovascular adverse reactions that can be fatal. While these do not refer directly to AMI, they indicate a possible increased risk of severe cardiac events associated with clozapine use. If chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, or ECG changes occur, they recommend discontinuing clozapine and obtaining a cardiac evaluation.

In summary, while clinical trials data on clozapine does not frequently report AMI as an adverse reaction, postmarketing experience indicates a potential link. Patients receiving clozapine should be monitored for symptoms that could suggest the onset of AMI or other serious cardiac conditions, and healthcare professionals should be aware of the cardiovascular risks associated with clozapine. If there are indications of myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiovascular issues, it is advised to discontinue clozapine and seek further cardiac evaluation.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,colesevelam,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label of colesevelam, there is no direct evidence to support that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an adverse reaction to colesevelam. The summary of adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience does not explicitly list AMI as a commonly reported adverse effect.

In clinical trials involving colesevelam for primary hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and familial hypercholesterolemia in pediatric patients, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal in nature, such as constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea, and some increases in creatine phosphokinase. Additionally, hypertriglyceridemia was noted as a laboratory abnormality that may result from colesevelam use, and when severe, it can lead to pancreatitis.

Under cardiovascular adverse reactions during diabetes trials, the documentation indicates that the incidence of patients with serious adverse reactions involving the cardiovascular system was 2.2% in the colesevelam hydrochloride group compared to 1% in the placebo group. These events included various conditions such as myocardial infarction, but the events listed were disparate, and the significance of the imbalance was stated as unknown. It's important to note that an increased incidence in the drug group compared to placebo does not establish a causal relationship without further investigation.

The post-marketing experience section does not mention AMI as a specific adverse reaction that has been observed following approval and widespread use of the drug. It covers a variety of other potential adverse reactions and drug interactions, further gastrointestinal issues, and effects on laboratory values such as an increase in transaminases and hypertriglyceridemia.

In conclusion, while there is mention of cardiovascular adverse events in the clinical trial data, AMI is not specifically cited as a common adverse reaction to colesevelam in the provided drug label information. Additional evaluation of the data and post-marketing reports would be necessary to make a specific determination on the relationship between colesevelam and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the available label information, there is no clear evidence to support a relationship between AMI and colesevelam exposure.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cyclobenzaprine,,"The drug label for cyclobenzaprine provided does not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial data for cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 5 mg or 10 mg. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance for cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 10 mg are drowsiness, dry mouth, and dizziness.

However, acute myocardial infarction is listed under ""Causal Relationship Unknown"" among other reactions that were reported rarely under circumstances where a causal relationship could not be established or were reported for other tricyclic drugs. This indicates that there have been instances of myocardial infarction associated with the use of cyclobenzaprine, but a direct causal relationship between cyclobenzaprine exposure and acute myocardial infarction has not been conclusively established within the clinical trial data or postmarketing surveillance.

The reporting of myocardial infarction in the label suggests that health care providers should be alert to this potential adverse event, even though it is not confirmed to be causally related to the drug. It is important to note that such reports may be incidental, related to underlying conditions, or a consequence of multiple factors unrelated to cyclobenzaprine itself.

It's crucial for healthcare professionals to consider a patient's overall health status, medical history, and concurrent medications when prescribing cyclobenzaprine, as factors such as preexisting cardiovascular disease or the use of other medications that affect the cardiovascular system could increase the risk of adverse cardiac events.

In conclusion, while acute myocardial infarction is not cited as a common adverse reaction to cyclobenzaprine in controlled clinical trial settings and postmarketing surveillance, it has been reported rarely, and a causal relationship has not been established. Further investigation and clinical judgment should be applied when prescribing cyclobenzaprine to patients who may be at increased risk of cardiovascular adverse reactions.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cyclophosphamide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cyclophosphamide exposure is derived from post-marketing experience, as stated in the provided drug label sections. According to section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience), myocardial infarction is listed as an identified adverse reaction. This information comes from reports obtained during clinical practice, where the medication has already been approved and is being used in the general population. Post-marketing surveillance often captures rare or long-term adverse reactions that may not have been evident in clinical trial data due to the limited duration of trials and sample sizes.

Specifically, the provided drug label notes cardiac adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, under the Postmarketing Experience section. Such adverse reactions are reported by healthcare professionals or consumers and collected through surveillance systems like the FDA's MedWatch program. It's important to note that while these reports indicate a temporal association between drug exposure and the adverse event, they do not necessarily prove causality. Post-marketing reports can be affected by factors such as reporting bias or confounding variables and typically do not provide information about the incidence rate of the reaction.

As for clinical trials or case studies specifically focused on cyclophosphamide and AMI, the provided sections do not include explicit evidence from these sources. If clinical trial data or case studies existed, they would offer more controlled environments to assess causality. However, given the absence of such data in the provided text, it cannot be concluded that AMI has been a significant focus in cyclophosphamide's clinical trials or reported in published case studies.

In summary, the association between cyclophosphamide exposure and acute myocardial infarction is supported by post-marketing surveillance data as mentioned in the drug labeling. These reports signal a potential adverse reaction but are not sufficient to establish a causal relationship on their own. There is no mention of supportive evidence from clinical trials or case studies in the provided label sections. Therefore, while there is some evidence suggesting a relationship, the exact nature and strength of the connection between cyclophosphamide and AMI remain less defined and would benefit from further research.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,cyclosporine,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under the “adverse reactions” associated with the use of cyclosporine. It is mentioned alongside a range of other adverse events that have been reported rarely. However, the label does not specify the frequency of AMI in relation to cyclosporine use or provide details such as a percentage of occurrence or the context within clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.

The evidence supporting the relationship between cyclosporine and AMI as an adverse reaction appears to be limited to post-marketing experience since it is not mentioned as a common adverse event in the “Clinical Studies” section nor among those events observed in more than 3% of patients. Post-marketing experiences can indicate potential adverse reactions that were not necessarily detected in clinical trials (possibly due to sample size, duration, or other factors) but have been observed in the broader patient population after the drug has been approved for use.

The label also indicates that cyclosporine exposure can lead to hypertension, which is a well-known risk factor for myocardial infarction. Approximately 26% of patients following renal transplantation and most cardiac transplant patients on cyclosporine can experience hypertension. This could suggest a mechanism by which cyclosporine could potentially contribute to the development of AMI – through its hypertensive effects, though this is not directly stated in relation to the AMI adverse reaction.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is listed as a rare adverse reaction to cyclosporine use in the post-marketing experience, the drug label does not provide detailed evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or specific post-marketing surveillance data quantifying the risk. Given that hypertension, which is a risk factor for AMI, has been associated with cyclosporine use, it is possible that there is a mechanistic link. Clinicians should be aware of this potential risk and monitor patients accordingly, but more targeted research would be required to establish a definitive causal relationship.","NA

The information provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections of the cyclosporine drug label does not refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cyclosporine. In fact, myocardial infarction is listed under cardiovascular disorders in the “Postmarketing Experience, Psoriasis” section, indicating that there have been reports of AMI in patients taking cyclosporine. Therefore, it cannot be stated that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of cyclosporine based on the provided sections of the drug label."
acute myocardial infarction,dabigatran etexilate,,"The adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction in association with dabigatran etexilate (marketed as Pradaxa) is supported by clinical trial data specifically from the VTE (venous thromboembolism) studies. According to the provided drug label sections:

1. Clinical Trials:
   - In the active-controlled VTE studies, a higher rate of clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received PRADAXA Capsules [20 (0.66 per 100 patient-years)] than in those who received warfarin [5 (0.17 per 100 patient-years)]. 
   - In the placebo-controlled study, a similar rate of nonfatal and fatal clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received PRADAXA Capsules [1 (0.32 per 100 patient-years)] and in those who received placebo [1 (0.34 per 100 patient-years)].

This suggests an increased rate of myocardial infarction in patients treated with dabigatran compared to warfarin in the context of treatment and risk reduction of VTE. It is important to note, however, the absolute rates of myocardial infarctions were relatively low.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - The label does not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction in the postmarketing experience section, which indicates that while myocardial infarction has been observed in clinical trials, the frequency of such adverse events in the general population post-approval is not elucidated in this section of the label or may not have been reported with sufficient frequency to include.

In summary, evidence from VTE clinical trials suggests there is an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with dabigatran compared to warfarin. The drug label does not provide specific frequencies of this adverse event from postmarketing surveillance. Given the seriousness of myocardial infarction, it would be necessary for healthcare professionals to weigh the benefits and risks when considering dabigatran for patients, particularly those with risk factors for coronary artery disease. The possibility of an increased risk of myocardial infarction should be part of the risk-benefit discussion with the patient when considering the use of dabigatran for the treatment or prevention of VTE.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,dabigatran etexilate,,"The direct evidence regarding acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to dabigatran etexilate is not explicitly detailed in the provided drug label sections. However, an increased number of clinical myocardial infarction events were reported in patients who received dabigatran etexilate in the context of studies on venous thromboembolism (VTE).

In active-controlled VTE studies, the rate of clinical myocardial infarctions was higher in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate (0.66 per 100 patient-years) than in those treated with warfarin (0.17 per 100 patient-years). This increased incidence suggests a potential relationship between dabigatran etexilate exposure and the occurrence of AMI. In the placebo-controlled study, the rates of nonfatal and fatal AMI were similar for patients on dabigatran etexilate and those on placebo, indicating that further investigation is warranted to establish a clear association.

The evidence from clinical trials is not strong enough to conclusively state that AMI is a common adverse reaction of dabigatran etexilate, but the data indicate a potential signal that requires further clinical research to confirm.

Importantly, the primary adverse reactions and warnings for dabigatran etexilate revolve around bleeding events due to its anticoagulant effects. The drug label comprehensively details the risk of bleeding and other related adverse events more so than thrombotic events like AMI.

It should be noted that postmarketing surveillance data can sometimes uncover additional adverse reactions that clinical trials may not identify due to larger and more diverse patient populations in real-world settings. The drug label mentions postmarketing experience, reporting various adverse reactions identified after approval, but does not specifically mention AMI.

In summary, while there is a mention of an increased number of AMI events in the context of VTE studies, there is not enough detailed evidence from the provided drug label sections to clearly establish acute myocardial infarction as a recognized adverse reaction of dabigatran etexilate. Further focused research is necessary to clarify this potential relationship.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as an adverse reaction in the context of treatment and reduction in the risk of recurrence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It states that ""a higher rate of clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received dabigatran etexilate capsules [20 (0.66 per 100 patient-years)] than in those who received warfarin [5 (0.17 per 100 patient-years)]."" Therefore, given that the label itself notes an increased rate of myocardial infarction in the dabigatran group, providing evidence to refute the relationship between AMI and dabigatran etexilate exposure is not applicable."
acute myocardial infarction,danazol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label's sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned as one of the adverse events that has been reported in association with the use of danazol capsules. However, it is important to note that a causal relationship has neither been confirmed nor refuted.

Specifically, the label section mentions ""myocardial infarction"" under the category where the causal relationship with danazol administration is not clearly established. This means that while there have been reports of AMI occurring during danazol treatment, it hasn't been conclusively determined whether danazol is the direct cause of the myocardial infarctions reported.

There is no detailed description of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data specifically addressing the incidence of AMI in danazol users in the provided sections. Such data would be necessary to establish a stronger evidence basis for a causal link between danazol and AMI.

The absence of confirmed causality suggests that if there is a risk of AMI due to danazol, it is likely to be a rare event or that there is insufficient data to fully assess the risk. Healthcare professionals prescribing danazol should consider this potential risk and monitor patients accordingly, particularly those with other cardiovascular risk factors.

Should further information be needed to clarify the relationship between danazol use and the risk of acute myocardial infarction, a search of peer-reviewed scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and post-market surveillance reports would be necessary. This more in-depth investigation could reveal case reports or observational studies that further discuss this potential side effect.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,daprodustat,,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and daprodustat (marketed as JESDUVROQ) primarily comes from the ASCEND-D clinical trial, which evaluated the safety of daprodustat in adults with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) with anemia.

According to the drug label sections provided:

1. **Adverse Reactions (6.1):** In the ASCEND-D trial, AMI was reported as one of the observed adverse events. The rate of myocardial infarction in patients treated with daprodustat was 3.4 per 100 person-years (PY), compared to 4.1 per 100 PY in the control group treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO).

2. **Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1):** The label includes a Boxed Warning indicating an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which encompasses AMI. It cautions against the use of daprodustat in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, or acute coronary syndrome within the 3 months prior to starting daprodustat and advises that no trial has identified a hemoglobin target level or dose of daprodustat that does not increase these risks.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:** The label does not provide specific details on post-marketing surveillance related to AMI as an adverse reaction of daprodustat. However, it includes contact information for reporting suspected adverse reactions to GlaxoSmithKline (the manufacturer) or the FDA.

In summary, clinical trial evidence from the ASCEND-D trial, which is mentioned in the drug's label, indicates that AMI is an observed adverse reaction in patients treated with daprodustat. The rates of myocardial infarction were documented in patients treated with daprodustat versus those treated with rhEPO. Additionally, a clear warning about the risk of thrombotic vascular events, including AMI, is provided in the Boxed Warning of the drug label. There are no specific details provided from case studies or post-marketing surveillance in the sections of the label provided. Users and healthcare providers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to appropriate channels.

acute myocardial infarction,darbepoetin alfa,1.0,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp), there is evidence supporting a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the use of this medication.

Clinical Trials:
The Summary of Clinical Trials (Section 6.1) and the Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.1) provide data obtained from randomized, controlled trials in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in those with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The trials compared higher versus lower hemoglobin targets and found an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with higher hemoglobin levels targeted by erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) like Darbepoetin alfa. Specifically, the document states that Darbepoetin alfa and other ESAs increased the risk of death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, and other thromboembolic events when they were used to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL.

Post-Marketing Experience (Section 6.2):
The drug label also notes that adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience. Although these are voluntarily reported and the frequency is uncertain, such reactions include myocardial infarction, among other cardiovascular events.

Box Warnings:
The drug label contains Boxed Warnings which highlight significant risks associated with the use of Darbepoetin alfa. The Box Warnings explicitly mention that treatment with ESAs has been associated with an increased risk of ""death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism.""

The evidence for acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of Darbepoetin alfa detailed in the clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and the Boxed Warnings indicates a relationship between the risk of this serious cardiovascular event and Darbepoetin alfa treatment, especially when targeting higher hemoglobin levels in specific patient populations. These sources should guide healthcare providers in considering the balance of benefits and risks when prescribing and monitoring treatment with Darbepoetin alfa.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,dasatinib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and dasatinib (marketed as SPRYCEL) exposure largely comes from the drug's label under sections highlighting potential adverse reactions and cardiovascular toxicity, as mentioned in your provided sections.

Specifically, the drug label indicates under sections 5 ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" and 6 ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" that cardiovascular toxicity, including cardiac ischemic events and related fluid retention, has been observed in clinical trials. These sections suggest that dasatinib might be associated with adverse cardiovascular events:

- In Section 5.4 ""Cardiovascular Toxicity,"" there is a statement that dasatinib can cause cardiac dysfunction, and after 5 years of follow-up in a randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML trial, cardiac ischemic events were reported (3.9% dasatinib vs 1.6% imatinib).
- Section 6.1 details that serious adverse reactions, including cardiac events, have been observed in clinical trials of dasatinib.
  
While the term ""acute myocardial infarction"" specifically is not used, cardiac ischemic events, which may include acute myocardial infarction, have been reported in these sections. It's important to note that Section 5.4 also reports on a small percentage of patients experiencing transient ischemic attacks and peripheral arterial occlusive disease, which could contribute to the risk of myocardial infarction.

The post-marketing experience, as detailed in Section 6.2, does not specifically list acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction post-approval but does mention other cardiac disorders such as atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and cardiac arrest.

From the provided information, while there is some evidence to suggest a potential relationship between dasatinib and adverse cardiac events, which could plausibly include acute myocardial infarction, explicit evidence linking dasatinib directly to acute myocardial infarction in clinical trial data is not cited. It would be important to review individual case reports, clinical trial data, and further post-marketing surveillance for more concrete evidence of this specific adverse reaction. Additionally, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions through established channels, which helps in the ongoing safety monitoring of the drug.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,decitabine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned in the context of serious adverse reactions to decitabine that have occurred in clinical experience, although the frequency of such events and the strength of the causal relationship to decitabine exposure are not spelled out. The label notes cardiac disorders, including myocardial infarction, but does not provide detail on the number of events, the context in which they occurred, or any predisposing factors that might be relevant.

Specifically, under the section titled “Serious adverse reactions,” myocardial infarction is listed among other serious events that were reported. However, without detailed data from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance provided in the label, it's difficult to establish a definitive causal relationship or the incidence rate of this adverse event. The statement implies that AMI is a recognized adverse event but does not indicate whether it occurred at a higher frequency compared to a control group or the general population.

To further assess the relationship between AMI and decitabine, additional information such as case studies, the nature of the reports, and any epidemiological studies would be beneficial. It would also be helpful to compare the incidence of AMI in patients receiving decitabine with the expected incidence in a similar population not receiving the drug. Without such data, we cannot determine whether AMI is a common or rare occurrence, whether it is definitely associated with decitabine, or whether there are specific risk factors that may predispose a patient on decitabine to experience this adverse reaction.

If such detailed evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance were available, it could be summarized here to give a clearer picture of the risks. In the absence of that data in the drug label, healthcare professionals are generally encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate regulatory body (e.g., FDA in the United States) to facilitate better understanding of the safety profile of the medication.

In summary, the drug label suggests that acute myocardial infarction can occur in patients receiving decitabine, but the available information does not provide enough detail to fully evaluate the strength of this potential relationship or to estimate the risk. Further investigation through more detailed clinical data or surveillance reports would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment.","Based on the information provided, acute myocardial infarction is listed as one of the serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving decitabine. While specific details such as the incidence rate or the strength of the causal relationship are not provided in the text, the mention of myocardial infarction suggests that there has been at least one reported instance of this adverse event in the context of decitabine treatment.

It is important to note that serious adverse reactions listed on drug labels typically result from a combination of clinical trial data, postmarketing reports, and other sources of evidence. Oftentimes, these reactions are rare and may not be encountered commonly in practice. However, the mere presence of myocardial infarction on the list indicates that there is some level of evidence supporting its inclusion as a potential adverse reaction to decitabine.

To refute a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and decitabine exposure, robust evidence such as controlled studies demonstrating a lack of association would be required. Such evidence is not provided in the given text. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and decitabine exposure based solely on the provided product label information.

In summary, there is no detailed evidence provided here to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of decitabine. The evidence for such an association may be limited and rare, but the exact relationship cannot be conclusively refuted with the information given."
acute myocardial infarction,desflurane,,"After reviewing the provided sections of the drug label for desflurane (Suprane), there is no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. Clinical trials as mentioned in section 6.1 have reported mostly mild and transient adverse events, with no direct reporting of AMI. The most common adverse reactions listed are coughing, breath holding, apnea, nausea, and vomiting. 

In the post-marketing experience detailed in section 6.2, various adverse reactions have been identified, such as cardiac arrest, ventricular failure, and Torsade de pointes, which are serious cardiac conditions, but there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction. Additionally, due to the nature of voluntary reporting, establishing a causal relationship between desflurane exposure and these cardiac disorders is quite challenging. 

Warnings in section 5 address other cardiac-related issues such as perioperative hyperkalemia and QTc prolongation, which could theoretically contribute to adverse cardiac events including arrhythmias, but again, there is no direct link made between desflurane and acute myocardial infarction.

Therefore, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence specifically supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction and desflurane exposure. Clinical trials have not reported AMI as an outcome, and while post-marketing surveillance has reported various cardiac disorders, these are not clearly linked to AMI, nor is their frequency reliably estimated. For a conclusive statement, other sources of scientific and clinical literature, such as controlled studies or case reports beyond the drug label, would need to be assessed.","NA

After reviewing the provided sections of the drug label regarding adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings for desflurane, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction or concern. The label does list various other cardiac events under the ""Post Marketing Experience"" (e.g., cardiac arrest, Torsade de pointes, ventricular failure, ventricular hypokinesia) and mentions QTc prolongation in the ""Warnings and Precautions,"" but acute myocardial infarction is not specified anywhere in the supplied text. Therefore, there appears to be no evidence presented in these sections of the label to refute or establish a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and desflurane exposure. Further investigation might be necessary to draw a comprehensive conclusion if additional evidence outside of the provided label exists."
acute myocardial infarction,desipramine,1.0,"The labeling information for desipramine hydrochloride, a tricyclic antidepressant, lists acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among the cardiovascular adverse reactions. While the mention in the label does not in itself establish causality, it indicates recognition of a potential risk that could be based on pharmacological similarity within the class of tricyclic antidepressants, case reports, clinical experience, or a combination of these sources, as direct evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance specific to desipramine and AMI is not detailed in the provided sections of the drug label.

Significantly, the label emphasizes caution when prescribing desipramine to patients with cardiovascular disease due to the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction. This cautionary note reflects awareness of a potential relationship between the drug and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The label also advises extra care in cases of patients with a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac conduction disturbances, suggesting an increased risk of severe cardiac adverse events in these populations.

Given that tricyclic antidepressants, including desipramine, have known effects on cardiac conduction and heart rate (able to induce tachycardia, arrhythmias, etc.), which can predispose to AMI, especially in vulnerable populations, the concern regarding AMI appears to be rooted in both the pharmacologic action of the drug and reported clinical experiences.

In summary, although the label for desipramine hydrochloride lists AMI as a possible adverse cardiovascular reaction, it does not provide specific evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that directly links desipramine to the incidence of AMI. The concern is likely based on pharmacologic considerations, clinical wisdom, and precautionary principles, especially given the serious nature of such an event. For more definitive evidence of causality, further investigation into published literature, such as case reports or epidemiological studies, would be necessary. However, that information is not provided in the drug label excerpts you've included.","NA

The drug label for desipramine includes myocardial infarction under the ""Cardiovascular"" subheading of the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section, thus acknowledging that myocardial infarction has been observed in association with its use. Therefore, refuting this established relationship is not applicable as per the provided label information."
acute myocardial infarction,desvenlafaxine,,"Evidence Summary: Acute Myocardial Infarction as an Adverse Reaction of Desvenlafaxine (PRISTIQ)

Clinical Studies Evidence:
The provided label sections from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences do not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in PRISTIQ treated major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in short-term fixed-dose studies (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo in the 50 or 100 mg dose groups) are gastrointestinal and nervous system-related issues, along with hyperhidrosis, decreased appetite, and anxiety. It should be noted that clinical trials are conducted in controlled environments, and adverse reaction rates observed may not reflect rates observed in regular clinical practice.

Post-Approval Evidence:
In the section describing uncommon adverse reactions in section 6.1, AMI is indeed mentioned but is characterized as uncommon and associated with existing cardiac risk factors. More events were reported during PRISTIQ treatment compared to placebo, warranting a warning and precaution notice.

Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions Sections:
These sections do not provide a direct association between AMI and the use of desvenlafaxine. However, it advises caution when administering PRISTIQ to patients with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases, indicative of a potential risk (5.7).

Conclusion:
While acute myocardial infarction is not clearly stated as a common adverse reaction in the clinical study summaries or the listed frequent adverse reactions, it is identified as an infrequent event in patients with multiple underlying cardiac risk factors in clinical study observations. The label advises caution when administering PRISTIQ to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, highlighting a possible association between the drug and adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction. Therefore, while there is no strong, direct evidence from clinical studies linking desvenlafaxine to AMI in the wider patient population, there is some evidence suggestive of a relationship, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. As always, healthcare providers should weigh the risks when considering treatment with desvenlafaxine in patients with potential cardiac issues.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,desvenlafaxine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for desvenlafaxine, there is mention that, in premarketing and postmarketing clinical studies, there were uncommon reports of ischemic cardiac adverse reactions, which included myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and coronary occlusion requiring revascularization. These cardiac events were observed more frequently in desvenlafaxine-treated patients compared to those given a placebo, and the patients who experienced these events had multiple underlying cardiac risk factors.

It is important to recognize that while there is evidence suggesting an association between desvenlafaxine and these adverse cardiac events, the occurrences were described as uncommon, and a direct causal relationship has not been conclusively established. It is also noted in the label that the patients already had multiple underlying cardiac risk factors, which could also contribute to the occurrence of these events.

In summary, there is some evidence from clinical studies suggesting a potential relationship between desvenlafaxine exposure and acute myocardial infarction, but these events are uncommon and may not occur in patients without pre-existing cardiac risk factors. As the evidence is taken from the drug's label and not from independent clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data, the strength of the evidence requires careful interpretation, taking the patients' medical histories into account.

Healthcare providers are advised to monitor patients on desvenlafaxine closely, especially those with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular conditions. If a patient develops sustained high blood pressure or symptoms indicative of cardiac ischemia, it would be prudent to assess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing desvenlafaxine therapy for that individual.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,dexlansoprazole,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as one of the cardiac disorders under the section covering less common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials at an incidence of less than 2%. This suggests that during the clinical trials for dexlansoprazole, there were some reported instances of AMI, but they were not common enough to affect more than 2% of the trial participants.

It is important to note that while AMI is mentioned, the drug label does not provide specific data regarding the absolute risk, the relative risk compared to a control group (if any), or detailed study results for this adverse event. Moreover, no causal relationship is clearly established from the label alone; it merely reports AMI as an observed adverse reaction during the trials without further elaboration on a direct link to the drug.

As for post-marketing experience, AMI does not appear to be directly mentioned in the section provided. This could imply that, up to the knowledge cutoff, no significant number of reports have been made to regulatory agencies that would warrant a formal warning or alert for AMI as a known adverse reaction based on post-marketing surveillance. This, however, does not completely rule out the possibility since post-marketing data can be less systematic and comprehensive than data from clinical trials.

Considering the information at hand, while there is some evidence of AMI reported during clinical trials for dexlansoprazole, the evidence does not appear to be sufficient to conclusively establish a relationship between dexlansoprazole exposure and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. For a more complete risk assessment, further data from clinical studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance findings would be required, including information on the patients' baseline cardiovascular risk, concomitant medications, and other potential confounding factors.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,dexmedetomidine,,"The provided drug label for dexmedetomidine includes detailed information about various adverse reactions seen in clinical trials and post-marketing experience. However, the label does not mention acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse event. When listing treatment-emergent adverse reactions in adult Intensive Care Unit Sedation and adult procedural sedation, the label provides a detailed table of incidence rates of various adverse reactions—none of which include AMI specifically.

Regarding cardiac disorders, the label's post-marketing experience section does list ""myocardial infarction"" alongside other cardiac conditions such as arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and tachycardia. This suggests that there have been reports of myocardial infarction during dexmedetomidine use after the drug has been approved and marketed. However, it is important to note that these reports come from voluntary submissions and do not establish a direct causal relationship between dexmedetomidine and AMI due to the uncontrolled nature of reporting and the inability to reliably estimate their frequency.

Moreover, the warnings and precautions section mentions adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, and transient hypertension—all of which could potentially contribute to cardiac complications. While these conditions can structurally contribute to or are associated with the risk factors for AMI, there is no direct evidence provided in the label that establishes a definitive causal relationship between dexmedetomidine use and acute myocardial infarction.

In summary, although the drug label for dexmedetomidine lists myocardial infarction as an adverse event identified in the post-marketing experience, no evidence from the clinical trials is provided to directly support a causal relationship between dexmedetomidine exposure and acute myocardial infarction. Any potential connection may be more related to the drug’s effects on blood pressure and heart rate rather than a direct causative effect on myocardial infarction. Further investigative studies would be required to determine a causative link.

To assess the risk of AMI associated with dexmedetomidine, healthcare professionals should rely on individual case details and consider the patient's overall health status, pre-existing conditions, and other risk factors for heart disease when evaluating these post-marketing reports.","There is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and dexmedetomidine exposure based on the provided drug label sections. The information presented primarily discusses adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth, among others, as documented in the clinical trials and post-marketing experience, without mentioning AMI as a known adverse reaction. However, under post-marketing experience, myocardial infarction is listed as a reported adverse reaction, albeit with the caveat that these are voluntary reports from a heterogeneous population and therefore it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Given the nature of post-marketing data, it is often difficult to determine causality, and further research would be required to confirm or refute any specific relationship between dexmedetomidine and AMI. In the absence of additional detailed clinical studies or robust post-marketing surveillance data specifically evaluating AMI risk with dexmedetomidine, no definitive conclusion can be drawn from the information provided.

If seeking to refute a claimed relationship between dexmedetomidine and AMI, one would look for large-scale epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or meta-analyses that do not show a statistically significant increase in the risk of AMI among patients treated with dexmedetomidine compared to control groups. As this specific information is not provided in the drug label sections, such evidence, if it exists, would need to be gathered from current medical and scientific literature sources."
acute myocardial infarction,dexmethylphenidate,,"The provided drug label sections from dexmethylphenidate do not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a reported adverse reaction from clinical trial data or postmarketing experience. While the label includes serious cardiac adverse events such as sudden death, arrhythmias, and tachycardia, specifically in sections 5.2 (Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease) and 5.3 (Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate), it does not mention AMI as a known direct adverse reaction associated with dexmethylphenidate use.

The precautions about serious cardiac disease highlight the importance of avoiding use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac issues. These statements suggest that while there may be a general risk of exacerbating pre-existing cardiac conditions, there is no explicit evidence in the provided label that directly associates dexmethylphenidate with the onset of AMI.

The most common adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials were non-cardiac in nature, including abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and nausea. Additionally, postmarketing reports list other adverse reactions, including cardiac disorders such as tachycardia and palpitations, but do not provide a direct link to AMI.

Therefore, based on the information provided from the drug label sections, there is no known evidence explicitly supporting a relationship between dexmethylphenidate exposure and acute myocardial infarction. As with all medications, it is essential for healthcare providers to evaluate the benefits and risks of dexmethylphenidate in the context of a patient's overall health profile, including pre-existing cardiac conditions, and to monitor for any new or worsening symptoms during treatment. For the most current information, one should refer to the latest drug labeling or conduct a review of the latest clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance reports.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,diclofenac,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the exposure to diclofenac comes from various sources, including the boxed warnings, adverse reactions label sections, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance. The summary of this evidence is as follows:

1. **Box Warning on the Label**: The label's box warning explicitly states that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including diclofenac, carry an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. This risk may appear early in the treatment and increases with the duration of use.

2. **Adverse Reaction Listing**: Myocardial infarction is listed under the ""Other adverse reactions, which occur rarely"" section for diclofenac, indicating that there have been reports of this condition in the context of diclofenac usage, albeit less frequently.

3. **Clinical Trials Experience**: While the summary of adverse reactions from clinical trials does not specifically address myocardial infarction, it provides a general perspective on the range of cardiovascular effects that may be associated with diclofenac, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, and tachycardia.

4. **Post-marketing Surveillance**: The data from post-marketing surveillance, including reports to the FDA or drug manufacturer as mentioned on the label (""To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS...""), provide a mechanism through which cases of myocardial infarction associated with diclofenac use can be reported and tracked. It should be noted that the actual incidences of myocardial infarction as an adverse event are generally established in a broader context once the drug is used in the general population outside of controlled clinical trials.

5. **Literature and Research Studies**: There are numerous epidemiological studies and meta-analyses that substantiate the association between NSAID use and increased cardiovascular risk, including myocardial infarction. These studies have supported regulatory warnings and contributed to the risk evaluation of NSAIDs.

In summary, the evidence supporting a potential relationship between acute myocardial infarction and exposure to diclofenac comes from regulatory warnings included in the drug's label, which recognize an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events as a class effect of NSAIDs, and from the reporting of myocardial infarction as a rare adverse reaction. Additionally, results from clinical trials, post-marketing reports, and independent research confirm an association between NSAID use, including diclofenac, and the occurrence of serious cardiovascular outcomes like myocardial infarction.","Evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and diclofenac is not available, as the drug label provided includes cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, as a potential adverse reaction of diclofenac use in the WARNING section. It indicates an increased risk of such events with NSAIDs use, which may occur early in the treatment and increase with the duration of use. It is also noted that diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft surgery due to this risk. Therefore, it is acknowledged that there is a recognized relationship between the drug exposure to diclofenac and the occurrence of myocardial infarction. 

Given the information in the provided label, stating that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction attributable to diclofenac would be inaccurate. Hence, the appropriate response is ""NA.""

Source: The adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections of the diclofenac drug label as provided in the query."
acute myocardial infarction,dihematoporphyrin ether,,"The information provided does not present evidence linking acute myocardial infarction directly to the administration of dihematoporphyrin ether (marketed as PHOTOFRIN). Acute myocardial infarction is not listed among the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, postmarketing experience, or under the warnings and precautions sections for PHOTOFRIN.

However, one relevant finding in the provided drug label includes the report of cardiac disorders such as atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure which occurred in at least 5% of patients with obstructing esophageal cancer after PHOTOFRIN photodynamic therapy (PDT). Also, cardiovascular reactions including angina pectoris, bradycardia, myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome, and supraventricular tachycardia have been reported but are noted to be rare and their relationship to the therapy is uncertain.

In Summary:
- Acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a common adverse reaction of PHOTOFRIN usage within the provided detailed sections of the drug label.
- Some cardiac-related adverse reactions, such as atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure, are noted in the label but do not directly implicate acute myocardial infarction as a common response to the drug.
- There is a mention of myocardial infarction among less common cardiovascular reactions, but the causal relationship to PHOTOFRIN PDT is uncertain and appears not to be a characteristic side effect based on available data.

As a language model, I do not have access to full databases of clinical studies or post-marketing surveillance data beyond the provided label information. Therefore, I would recommend consulting the latest scientific literature or databases, such as PubMed or regulatory agency websites (e.g., FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System), for more comprehensive and updated information on the potential adverse reactions of dihematoporphyrin ether, including any possible relationship with acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,dihydroergotamine,,"The evidence regarding the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and dihydroergotamine, derived from the drug label sections provided, can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials:
- There is no direct mention of AMI occurring in the controlled clinical trials for dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, where 1,796 patients were treated with doses of 2 mg or less. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low (1.4%) and did not reference AMI specifically.
- Commonly reported adverse events in placebo-controlled trials for migraine treatment with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray included rhinitis, nausea, vomiting, altered sense of taste, and dizziness; AMI was not listed among these events.

Post-Marketing Experience:
- Serious cardiac events, including AMI, were reported in post-marketing surveillance for the parenteral form of dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45® Injection). However, such events were noted as extremely rare.

Warnings:
- Serious and/or life-threatening peripheral ischemia has been linked with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, potentially leading to vasospasm, which could contribute to myocardial ischemia (a precursor to AMI).

Box Warnings:
- No specific box warnings were provided regarding AMI, but there is a general warning about peripheral ischemia that accompanies potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, as mentioned above.

To conclude, while acute myocardial infarction is not reported as a common adverse event in controlled clinical trials for dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, there have been rare reports of serious cardiac events including AMI following the use of the injectable form in post-marketing surveillance. Additionally, there is a recognized risk of peripheral and cerebral ischemia when dihydroergotamine is coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, which could theoretically predispose to AMI.

For healthcare professionals and patients, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits before using dihydroergotamine, especially in individuals with known cardiovascular risk factors or when there is potential interaction with other drugs metabolized through the CYP3A4 pathway.","NA
"
acute myocardial infarction,diltiazem,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for diltiazem hydrochloride, the evidence regarding acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a potential adverse reaction is limited. Here’s a summary:

1. **Clinical Trials Data**: 
   The available data from controlled clinical trials for angina do not indicate an increased incidence of adverse reactions with diltiazem compared to placebo. There is no explicit mention in the clinical trials section of AMI as an adverse reaction.

2. **Adverse Reaction Frequency**:
   The frequent adverse reactions reported include edema, headache, nausea, dizziness, rash, and asthenia, with each occurring in more than 1% of patients. Cardiovascular occurrences less frequently observed (less than 1%) include various arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, and other heart-related issues. There is no specific frequency data provided for AMI.

3. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**:
   Post-marketing events are those observed after the drug has been released to the market, reflecting a broader population. Acute myocardial infarction was mentioned among the observed events. However, it is important to note that the label explicitly states that ""events such as myocardial infarction have been observed, which are not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients."" This suggests that it is difficult to differentiate whether the AMI is a result of diltiazem use or the progression of underlying cardiac conditions in these patients.

4. **Causality and Relationship**:
   The label underscores that a definite cause-and-effect relationship between AMI and diltiazem therapy has not been established. This means while AMI has been observed in the post-marketing surveillance, there isn’t conclusive evidence to link it directly as an adverse reaction caused by diltiazem.

5. **Reporting of Adverse Reactions**:
   The label encourages reporting suspected adverse reactions to ScieGen Pharmaceuticals or the FDA which indicates ongoing data collection and monitoring of adverse effects including myocardial infarction.

In summary, the relationship between diltiazem exposure and acute myocardial infarction remains uncertain based on the drug label. AMI has been reported during post-marketing surveillance, but the evidence does not conclusively establish it as an adverse reaction directly attributable to diltiazem because it may be confounded by the natural progression of underlying cardiac disease in these patients. Without further study and evidence from clinical trials or observational studies specifically designed to assess this relationship, no definite conclusion can be made.","N/A

The drug label information provided mentions myocardial infarction among postmarketing events. It notes that events like myocardial infarction have been observed but also states they are not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients, implying that such events could be due to the underlying condition rather than the medication itself. Additionally, a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between myocardial infarction and diltiazem hydrochloride therapy has not been established according to the label. Based on this information, there is no clear evidence refuting the relationship between myocardial infarction and diltiazem exposure, but there is also no established causal connection."
acute myocardial infarction,dinoprostone,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exposure to dinoprostone, a drug used for cervical ripening and induction of labor, under the brand name CERVIDIL.

Clinical Trials:
The clinical trials described for CERVIDIL (dinoprostone) primarily reported on obstetric-related adverse reactions such as uterine tachysystole with or without fetal distress and fetal distress without uterine tachysystole. Acute myocardial infarction was not listed as a common adverse reaction (≥ 2%) in the clinical trials detailed in the summary provided.

Post-marketing Experience:
However, in the post-marketing experience section, myocardial infarction is cited as an adverse reaction that has been identified during the post-approval use of CERVIDIL or other dinoprostone products. It is specifically mentioned that myocardial infarction has occurred in women with a history of myocardial infarction. This suggests that post-marketing surveillance data have indicated a potential relationship between dinoprostone exposure and the occurrence of AMI in certain susceptible individuals.

The post-marketing reports are notably based on voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size, and while these reports cannot reliably estimate the frequency of such an event or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure due to the spontaneous and uncontrolled nature of reporting, they do provide information on observed potential risks following the wider use of the medication outside of clinical trials.

Warnings and Precautions:
The warnings and precautions section does not explicitly link dinoprostone to an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction outside of the context of a history of myocardial infarction. Instead, it includes various other risks associated with the drug's use, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, amniotic fluid embolism syndrome, and uterine tachysystole, among others.

Conclusion:
To summarize, the direct evidence from the clinical trials does not include AMI as a common adverse reaction (≥2%) associated with dinoprostone. However, post-marketing surveillance has provided instances of myocardial infarction occurring in patients with a prior history of the condition, suggesting a possible association between dinoprostone exposure and acute myocardial infarction in a specific patient subset. It is important to interpret post-marketing reports with caution due to their inherent limitations, including potential reporting biases and the lack of controlled conditions.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,dipyridamole,1.0,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, the adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in relation to the exposure to dipyridamole appears to be rare. The label indicates that AMI was documented as an adverse event but occurred in only 0.1% (approximately 4 out of 3911) of the patients within a study where intravenous dipyridamole was used as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging. This suggests that while there is a statistically detectable association between dipyridamole exposure and AMI in this context, the incidence rate is very low.

It's important to note that this evidence is drawn from a single study and that AMI as an adverse event is also listed under the warnings section of the drug label, which implies clinical or post-marketing observations have deemed it significant enough to warrant attention. The label further cites the occurrence of serious adverse events such as cardiac death and ventricular fibrillation; however, it does not specify the frequency of these events beyond their inclusion in the category of severe outcomes.

Other cardiovascular adverse reactions, such as chest pain/angina pectoris, electrocardiographic changes, and various arrhythmias, were also reported more frequently than myocardial infarction, which suggests a broader cardiovascular risk profile that may or may not lead to AMI in susceptible individuals.

While the drug label alludes to post-marketing surveillance, it does not provide specific incidences or the nature of the events beyond mentioning their rarity. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the published literature and spontaneous adverse event reports (which may provide additional instances of AMI in patients taking dipyridamole) would be required to further evaluate the evidence supporting the relationship.

In conclusion, the direct evidence from the clinical study cited on the drug label suggests a very low incidence of acute myocardial infarction associated with the use of dipyridamole. However, the presence of AMI as a listed warning implies that there are other data sources or clinical considerations that support its inclusion as a potential risk. Without further specific data from post-marketing surveillance or literature, it is difficult to fully evaluate the strength of this association.","Based on the information provided from the study of 3911 patients in which intravenous dipyridamole was used as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging, there is acknowledgement of myocardial infarction as a serious adverse event associated with dipyridamole. The label explicitly lists myocardial infarction (0.1%–see WARNINGS) in the cardiovascular system subsection of the ""Less Common Adverse Reactions."" Given this information, there is evidence from clinical studies that acute myocardial infarction can be an adverse reaction of dipyridamole, although it appears to be a rare event.

Thus, refuting the relationship between dipyridamole exposure and acute myocardial infarction is not justified with the current evidence provided, as the drug's label itself lists myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction. Consequently, as per your guidance, the appropriate response here is ""NA"", because the adverse reaction is related to the drug according to the available evidence.

For a complete and thorough analysis of the relationship between dipyridamole and acute myocardial infarction, including a refutation where applicable, a more extensive review of clinical trial data, case reports, pharmacovigilance databases, and epidemiological studies would be required. However, such data has not been provided in the current context."
acute myocardial infarction,docetaxel,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for docetaxel, acute myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attack) is not listed as a common adverse reaction. The label does mention cardiovascular reactions that may occur in patients treated with docetaxel, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and hypertension, but acute myocardial infarction is not specifically identified.

In section 6.1 of the Clinical Trials Experience, under Cardiovascular Reactions, it states that clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension have occurred. There is also mention of deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal in a small percentage of metastatic breast cancer patients. However, the explicit occurrence of acute myocardial infarction is not described in the clinical trials data provided.

Post-marketing experiences listed in the label report instances of myocardial ischemia (which can be related to AMI), but it is important to note that post-marketing data does not always establish a clear causal relationship to drug exposure due to the uncontrolled nature of reporting. The label specifically states that these are adverse reactions identified from clinical trials and/or post-marketing surveillance without a reliable estimation of their frequency or direct causal relationship to docetaxel exposure.

To summarize, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction in the clinical trial sections provided for docetaxel. Some cardiovascular events that could be precursors or related to myocardial infarction, such as unstable angina or myocardial ischemia, are noted. However, without further detailed evidence from additional studies, case reports, or pharmacovigilance data specifically associating AMI with docetaxel, we cannot conclude that there is a direct relationship. If such occurrences have been identified through post-marketing surveillance or additional studies, they are not detailed within the sections of the label provided to me.","Based on the extensive product label information provided, **acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not explicitly listed as a common or serious adverse reaction to docetaxel**. AMI is a serious heart condition characterized by the sudden blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, leading to tissue damage and potential life-threatening complications. 

The most common adverse reactions listed for docetaxel include a variety of hematologic toxicities (such as neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), infections, hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, neuropathy, gastrointestinal events, and cutaneous reactions. Serious adverse reactions highlighted involve toxic deaths, hepatic impairment concerns, hematologic effects, hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, and second primary malignancies, among others. Cardiovascular reactions mentioned are primarily related to hypotension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and changes in left ventricular ejection fraction.

While cardiovascular adverse events are described, **there is no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction being associated with docetaxel usage** in the sections provided. To definitively refute the relationship between AMI and docetaxel, a thorough review of clinical trial data, case studies, post-marketing surveillance, and relevant published literature would be required. If evidence were present, it would typically include reports of AMI incidence rates in treated populations compared to control groups, statistical analyses to determine the likelihood of association, and biological plausibility assessments.

In the absence of explicit data refuting the relationship from the label, detailed literature searches and pharmacovigilance database reviews would be the next steps to determine if any evidence refutes the association between docetaxel and AMI. If such evidence does not exist or is not provided, it cannot be confirmed that AMI is not related to docetaxel exposure. However, based solely on the information provided, AMI as an adverse reaction is not recognized in the context of docetaxel treatment according to the drug label details."
acute myocardial infarction,dofetilide,,"The provided drug label information for dofetilide details various adverse reactions seen in clinical trials but does not specifically list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common or dose-related adverse reaction. Dofetilide is known to have a risk of serious arrhythmias, with the most noteworthy being Torsade de Pointes, which displayed a dose-related increase in incidence.

According to the clinical program data for dofetilide, which included approximately 8,600 patients across 130 studies, dofetilide was administered to 5,194 patients, and adverse reactions for cardiac arrhythmias and non-cardiac reactions were presented separately. In studies with patients affected by supraventricular arrhythmias, 1,346 were exposed to dofetilide and 8.7% discontinued due to adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were headache, chest pain, and dizziness. For serious arrhythmias and conduction disturbances like Torsade de Pointes, the incidence was 0.8% for patients on the recommended dosing regimen. However, no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse event is made in these sections.

In the DIAMOND trials, which focused on patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and those with a recent myocardial infarction (MI), 1,511 patients were exposed to dofetilide for up to three years. The occurrence of Torsade de Pointes was reported as 3.3% in CHF patients and 0.9% in post-MI patients. However, the label does not specifically report AMI as an observed adverse event related to dofetilide administration in these trials. It is worth noting that a small portion of patients did experience ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which are risk factors for AMI, but these are not directly equivalent to reporting an incidence of AMI itself.

Even in the tabulated data for non-cardiac adverse reactions in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, AMI is listed as an adverse event with a frequency of ≤2% and is numerically more frequent with dofetilide than with placebo, but no precise incidence rates are offered in the label.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is mentioned among the adverse events occurring at a rate of ≤2% and numerically more frequently with dofetilide than with placebo, the evidence does not suggest a strong or direct relationship between dofetilide exposure and the occurrence of AMI. The primary focus of the provided label information is on the risk of Torsade de Pointes and other serious arrhythmias. The label emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of patients starting or restarting treatment with dofetilide, especially regarding renal function and cardiac rhythm, to mitigate the risk of arrhythmias.

For AMI to be definitively considered an adverse reaction to dofetilide, more direct evidence would be necessary, such as incidence rates from clinical trials or case studies demonstrating a clear temporal relationship between dofetilide use and the occurrence of AMI.

*Please note that this summary is based on the provided drug label sections and may not include the totality of information available in the complete label or other sources such as more recent study results or post-marketing surveillance data.*","Based on the data provided in the drug label, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and dofetilide exposure. The label does indicate that myocardial infarction was reported as an adverse event with a frequency of ≤2% and numerically more frequently with dofetilide than with placebo in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. This suggests that there is at least some reported incidence of AMI potentially associated with dofetilide use.

However, the causal relationship between dofetilide and AMI cannot be conclusively determined from the data given, as these events are reported with low frequency and may also occur due to the underlying cardiovascular conditions for which dofetilide is prescribed, such as arrhythmias. The drug label does not provide a clear, statistically powered analysis that would rule out AMI as an adverse reaction definitively.

To further assess the relationship between AMI and dofetilide, a detailed epidemiological study, randomized controlled trials, or a meta-analysis with appropriate controls and statistical power to detect such an association would be required. Absence of such data means we cannot conclusively say that AMI is not an adverse reaction of dofetilide; conversely, we do not have strong evidence to assert it as a definite adverse reaction either. Therefore, based on the information available in the drug label alone, the evidence neither confirms nor refutes AMI as an adverse reaction to dofetilide."
acute myocardial infarction,donepezil,,"The provided drug label sections for donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, do not directly report acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction.

The ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section of the label relates primarily to reactions consistent with the drug’s cholinomimetic effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia. The cardiovascular conditions mentioned refer to vagotonic effects on heart nodes, which could manifest as bradycardia or heart block, as well as syncopal episodes (""5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions"").

The ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" subsection reveals that donepezil has been trialed in over 1,700 individuals. However, there is no specific mention of AMI as an outcome in these trials. Rather, the most common reactions leading to treatment discontinuation are gastrointestinal in nature.

The ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" provides a list of reactions identified during post-approval use of donepezil, but it does not single out AMI.

""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" indicates potential cardiovascular effects due to cholinesterase inhibition, such as bradycardia or heart block, but again, no clear link is made to AMI.

In summary, based on the provided sections of the drug label for donepezil, there is no reported evidence that directly supports a relationship between donepezil exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, either in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. While cardiovascular effects have been noted, they are generally related to conduction abnormalities and bradycardia rather than myocardial infarction. If more comprehensive data or studies outside of these label sections exist that explore a potential link between donepezil and AMI, they have not been included in the provided information.","NA

Based on the available evidence and drug label information provided, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse reaction of donepezil in either the controlled clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The main adverse reactions and concerns are related to its cholinomimetic effects, gastrointestinal issues, neurological conditions, and potential for heart block or bradycardia, but no direct refutation or evidence is offered regarding acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, as per the instructions, the response is ""NA"" as there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and donepezil exposure."
acute myocardial infarction,dotatate,,"Based on the information provided, which likely represents extracts from the prescribing information or drug label for Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (LUTATHERA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is identified as a serious adverse reaction that was observed in clinical practice.

From the clinical trial ERASMUS, which studied the safety of LUTATHERA in 1214 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, myocardial infarction was reported as a serious adverse reaction with an incidence of 1%. This trial was open-label and involved the administration of LUTATHERA either with or without octreotide, with a subset of 811 patients included in a retrospective medical record review documenting serious adverse reactions.

Additionally, post-marketing surveillance, which collects data on adverse reactions after a drug has been approved and is in widespread use, supports the evidence from ERASMUS. Although the incidence and causal relationship were not clearly established due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the uncertainty regarding population size, myocardial infarction was listed among the adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of LUTATHERA.

Therefore, there is evidence from clinical practice, as shown in the ERASMUS trial and post-marketing surveillance data, to support the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to LUTATHERA. It is important to note that the clinical trial NETTER-1, which also evaluated the safety of LUTATHERA, did not specifically cite acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction. However, both sources of evidence should be considered when assessing the potential relationship between LUTATHERA and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction.

In conclusion, while there is evidence of acute myocardial infarction occurring in patients treated with LUTATHERA, the exact frequency and the strength of the causal relationship remain uncertain due to the nature of the data sources. It’s essential for healthcare professionals to remain vigilant in monitoring patients for this serious adverse event during and after treatment with LUTATHERA.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,doxazosin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention or established evidence linking acute myocardial infarction with the use of doxazosin in the adverse reactions (6), warnings (5), or box warnings listed. The label makes no mention of acute myocardial infarction as a clinical trial or postmarketing experience adverse event.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions from clinical trials include fatigue, malaise, hypotension, and dizziness. In the section detailing postmarketing experience (6.2), several cardiovascular-related adverse reactions such as bradycardia are listed, but there is no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction.

Cardiac disorders mentioned in Table 1 and Table 2, occurring more frequently with doxazosin than with placebo include hypotension (1.7% vs. 0% in BPH patients) and other less than 1% frequency events plausibly related to doxazosin use, such as palpitations. However, these are not indicative of or synonymous with acute myocardial infarction.

In summary, according to the provided sections of the drug label for doxazosin, there is no evidence of a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and doxazosin exposure from clinical trials, case studies, or postmarketing surveillance. If there is concern for such a relationship, further detailed investigation into the scientific literature and adverse event reporting databases would be necessary to conclusively determine if there is any additional evidence supporting this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,duloxetine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label and the adverse reactions reported, there is no direct evidence that links acute myocardial infarction (AMI) specifically as an adverse reaction to the use of duloxetine. The adverse reactions listed in the drug label for duloxetine in adult clinical trials include nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, constipation, decreased appetite, and hyperhidrosis, among others. Additionally, severe adverse reactions described in the labeling include hepatotoxicity, orthostatic hypotension, falls and syncope, serotonin syndrome, abnormal bleeding, severe skin reactions, and others. 

Postmarketing experience with duloxetine has revealed a range of other adverse reactions, which are voluntarily reported and are of an uncertain size; therefore, they do not reliably establish a frequency or a causal relationship to duloxetine exposure. Some of these include acute pancreatitis, anaphylactic reaction, liver injury, angle-closure glaucoma, and seizures upon discontinuation. 

While the label indicates that there have been infrequent postmarketing reports of myocardial infarction (within the Cardiac Disorders subsection), it does not establish duloxetine as a definitive cause of AMI. Infrequent events are described as those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, which indicates they are very rare. 

Given that myocardial infarction is not listed as a common adverse reaction or as a part of the warnings and precautions section, and considering the rarity of postmarketing reports, there is not substantial evidence to assert a strong relationship between duloxetine exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. However, since duloxetine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable coronary artery disease, clinicians should exercise caution and consider the benefit-risk profile in patients with significant underlying cardiovascular issues. 

This summary is based on the details mentioned in the drug label sections provided. Any emerging evidence or additional postmarketing surveillance data that is not included here may potentially alter this conclusion.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,eletriptan,1.0,"The drug label provided for eletriptan (a 5-HT_1 agonist used for the acute treatment of migraine) includes information that directly relates to the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Here is a summary of the evidence supporting this relationship:

1. Clinical Trials (Section 6.1 of the drug label): 
   - Among 4,597 patients treated for the first migraine headache in short-term placebo-controlled trials with eletriptan, the most common adverse reactions reported were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, and somnolence.
   - Adverse reactions were not found to increase when up to two doses of eletriptan were taken within 24 hours.
   - The incidence of adverse reactions did not vary significantly by patient gender, age, or race, nor by the concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis or hormonal therapies.
   - There is no explicit mention of AMI occurring during these trials in the sections provided.

2. Post-marketing Experience (Section 6.2 of the drug label): 
   - In this section, various post-marketing adverse reactions are reported, including neurological events like seizures and digestive issues like vomiting.
   - While AMI is not explicitly listed here, it should be noted that post-marketing data is gathered from voluntary reports and therefore may not be comprehensive.

3. Warnings and Precautions (Section 5 of the drug label): 
   - Section 5.1 mentions that serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported following the use of eletriptan.
   - Although rare, these occurrences of AMI could arise within hours following administration and have been observed in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD).
   - Due to the risk of AMI, eletriptan is contraindicated in patients with both ischemic and vasospastic CAD.
   - Section 5.1 also advises a cardiovascular evaluation in patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors and are naive to triptans like eletriptan.

In conclusion, while acute myocardial infarction is not a common adverse reaction in clinical trials at the frequency of reports for other reactions, there is evidence from the warnings and precautions section of the label that AMI has been reported after eletriptan administration, particularly in the context of post-marketing surveillance. It's critical for healthcare providers to assess individual patient risk factors for cardiovascular disease prior to prescribing eletriptan and to educate patients about the potential signs and symptoms of AMI.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,enalapril,,"The relationship between enalapril exposure and the adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is acknowledged in the drug label for enalapril maleate under ""Other serious clinical adverse experiences."" The label indicates that myocardial infarction has been reported, which is categorized along with other cardiovascular events that may occur in patients depending on their individual risk factors.

From the provided sections of the drug label:
- In controlled clinical trials involving patients with heart failure, the incidence of myocardial infarction was reported as 1.2 percent with the note that discontinuation due to myocardial infarction was at a rate of 0.3 percent.
- Under the ""Cardiovascular"" heading of other serious adverse experiences since the drug was marketed, myocardial infarction is listed but noted to be possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high-risk patients.

The above suggests that while myocardial infarction has been observed in patients treated with enalapril, it is not among the most common adverse reactions and may be related to the hypotensive effects of the drug, especially in patients already at high cardiovascular risk. No specific evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance is provided that directly quantifies the risk or establishes a causal relationship between enalapril and AMI.

It must be highlighted that adverse event reporting does not confirm causality; however, it does raise potential safety concerns that healthcare providers should monitor. Since the label refers to myocardial infarction as an event ""possibly secondary to excessive hypotension,"" the evidence suggests a potential indirect relationship where enalapril-induced hypotension in patients at risk could lead to ischemic events, including AMI.

In conclusion, the drug label for enalapril maleate notes myocardial infarction as a reported adverse experience, with a small percentage of occurrence in clinical trials and post-marketing experience, sometimes in the context of excessive hypotension. There is no direct clinical trial evidence provided to establish a definite causal relationship between enalapril and AMI. Healthcare providers should consider individual patient risk factors and monitor for signs of hypotension or related ischemic cardiovascular events during enalapril therapy.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,enalaprilat,1.0,"The evidence supporting the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with enalaprilat use can be summarized as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Evidence:
In the provided drug label sections, myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse experience that occurred in 0.5 to 1.0 percent of patients during controlled clinical trials of enalaprilat. This information implies that AMI was observed in a small fraction of patients during the clinical testing phase of the drug.

2. Association with Enalapril:
Since enalaprilat is the active metabolite of enalapril, adverse reactions associated with enalapril may also be expected to occur with enalaprilat. Among such reactions, cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction are specified under the cardiovascular category. Although the document does not quantify the exact incidence of AMI in patients taking enalapril, it mentions the possibility of AMI or cerebrovascular accident secondary to excessive hypotension in high-risk patients. This indicates that there is an acknowledged risk of serious cardiovascular events, including AMI, particularly in certain vulnerable populations.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The provided information does not mention any specific data from post-marketing surveillance relating to AMI as an adverse effect of enalaprilat. Post-marking surveillance often assists in identifying rare or long-term adverse effects that may not be detected in clinical trials due to their limited duration and sample sizes.

4. Boxed Warnings:
The boxed warnings in the label do not mention AMI directly but include severe risks such as hypotension, fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality, and liver function test alterations.

Based on the information provided from the drug label, we can conclude that there is evidence from clinical trials that acute myocardial infarction was observed as an adverse event in a small percentage of patients treated with enalaprilat. The exact frequency and causality are not detailed, and it is crucial for clinicians to consider the risk of AMI, especially in high-risk patients or those experiencing significant hypotension. However, detailed post-marketing data about this potential adverse reaction is not provided in the label information summarized here. Further research or data may be necessary to fully understand the association and to provide more precise incidence rates or risk factors for AMI related to enalaprilat use.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,encorafenib,,"Based on the label information provided for encorafenib (BRAFTOVI), there is evidence suggesting a relationship between the drug and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. However, the evidence for this relationship is limited to observed cases in clinical trials rather than a large-scale assessment of risk.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- In the PHAROS trial for metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with encorafenib in combination with binimetinib, myocardial infarction was reported as a serious adverse event. The incidence of myocardial infarction was observed in approximately 2% of patients (fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received encorafenib with binimetinib, this included myocardial infarction in 1% of patients).

Warnings and Precautions Evidence:
- The drug label for encorafenib indicates a warning for cardiomyopathy, a condition that can lead to heart failure and is related to the function of the heart muscle. While cardiomyopathy is not the same as AMI, the presence of cardiomyopathy and its monitoring in the clinical trials does suggest a level of cardiovascular risk that could potentially encompass adverse events such as myocardial infarction.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Unfortunately, the provided drug label does not include specific information regarding the incidence of acute myocardial infarction during post-marketing surveillance. Generally, post-marketing surveillance may reveal adverse reactions that were not evident in clinical trials due to larger and more diverse patient populations being exposed to the drug.

It should be noted that the evidence for acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to encorafenib largely comes from its inclusion in the list of serious adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials. Direct causal relationships are difficult to establish, and more detailed information from post-marketing surveillance or further studies would be needed to better understand the risk. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or pre-existing heart conditions may be at increased risk when taking this medication, and healthcare providers typically monitor these patients closely.

The information about adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, is sourced from clinical trial data provided in the drug label, particularly from the safety evaluation conducted during the PHAROS trial. There is no mention of case studies specifically related to AMI as an adverse event of encorafenib in the provided label information. For a comprehensive risk assessment, healthcare providers consider individual patient risk factors, clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance reports, and the emerging literature when prescribing and monitoring the effects of encorafenib.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,enoxaparin,,"The information provided discusses several adverse reactions associated with the use of enoxaparin, an anticoagulant drug. However, it does not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse reaction. The clinical trials and post-marketing experience focus on bleeding events, thrombocytopenia, and local injection site reactions as the more common side effects.

In the extensive clinical trial data presented for various indications (e.g., prevention of deep vein thrombosis, treatment of unstable angina, and treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction), bleeding episodes are the most prominently reported major adverse events. The use of enoxaparin in the treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction indicates that the drug is part of the therapeutic regimen for this condition, rather than a cause of it.

Increased serum aminotransferases, local reactions, and other systemic symptoms, such as thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis, are mentioned as possible adverse reactions. It is noteworthy that among patients treated for various conditions with enoxaparin, thrombocytopenia is reported, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and subsequently worsen outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

According to the information provided, there is no direct evidence or reported clinical trial findings that link enoxaparin use to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. However, it's important to note that medications that affect hemostasis, like enoxaparin, require careful monitoring due to the potential risks associated with their use, including bleeding complications that could impact myocardial infarction prognosis.

For the most accurate and updated information, it would be necessary to refer to the latest clinical data, post-marketing surveillance reports, and medical literature. If data from these sources suggest a potential link between enoxaparin and acute myocardial infarction, it would typically be detailed in the sections on clinical trial experience or post-marketing experience. Given the scope of the provided sections, it appears that there is currently no known evidence to suggest that enoxaparin causes acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,epcoritamab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is reported as a fatal adverse reaction in the clinical trials for epcoritamab (EPKINLY). Specifically, the document states that AMI occurred in 0.6% of patients who received EPKINLY in the EPCORE NHL-1 clinical trial, which evaluated the safety of EPKINLY in patients with relapsed or refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma (LBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

In the safety evaluation of 157 patients within the aforementioned trial, EPKINLY was administered according to a defined dosing schedule. Patients were excluded from the study if they had CNS involvement of lymphoma, a history of allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, an ongoing active infection, or known impaired T-cell immunity. The median number of prior therapies for the patient population was 3, and the median duration of exposure to EPKINLY was 5 cycles.

While the clinical trials’ report provides direct evidence of myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to epcoritamab, the incidence rate was relatively low (0.6%), indicating that while the risk is present, it’s not common among patients treated with this drug.

The drug label does not provide detailed data on the circumstances or patient characteristics that might have contributed to the occurrence of AMI, such as previous history of cardiovascular disease, concurrent medications, or other risk factors. Therefore, the relationship between epcoritamab and acute myocardial infarction, while observed, may not be fully characterized and warrants further investigation.

Additional evidence from larger post-marketing surveillance or further controlled trials may provide clearer insights into the risk factors, incidence rate, and mechanisms underpinning the association of AMI with epcoritamab therapy. However, based on the information available in the drug label, the evidence supports the conclusion that there is a potential for acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction in patients treated with epcoritamab, albeit rarely.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,epinephrine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for epinephrine, we can understand the evidence that supports the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and epinephrine exposure. It's important to note, however, that the label does not directly list AMI as a common adverse reaction; rather, it details potential cardiovascular adverse events that could be related to or lead to such an incident. The information can be summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials:**
The provided drug label indicates a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials for epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis, which makes it challenging to determine the true incidence of adverse reactions, including AMI.

**Case Studies and Observational Trials:**
The label describes various cardiovascular effects, such as angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and ventricular ectopy. These have been documented in observational trials, case reports, and studies. In particular, angina, which suggests an inadequacy of blood supply to the heart, may be a precursor to AMI.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
Adverse reaction reports received post-marketing are noted to include severe cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias (including fatal ventricular fibrillation) and rapid rises in blood pressure leading to cerebral hemorrhage, especially in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. While AMI is not explicitly mentioned, the presence of severe arrhythmias and hypertension can contribute to the risk of a heart attack, therefore implying a potential association.

**Additional Warnings:** 
The drug label underscores the need for caution when administering epinephrine to patients with heart disease, including those with cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery disease. The drug can provoke or exacerbate angina pectoris and induce ventricular arrhythmias in such high-risk groups, both of which are related to the development of an AMI.

**Summary:**
While acute myocardial infarction is not directly listed as an adverse reaction, the relationship can be inferred from the documented cardiovascular responses to epinephrine exposure. Individuals with underlying heart conditions or those taking medications that sensitize the heart to arrhythmias are particularly at risk. The evidence supporting this relationship comes from observational trials, case reports, adverse event reports, and the known pharmacological action of epinephrine as a significant cardiovascular stimulant.

For a complete assessment, one would also seek data from peer-reviewed journals, professional healthcare databases, and further post-marketing surveillance studies to establish a clear link between epinephrine administration and the occurrence of AMI. However, based on the data provided, we can conclude that there is a potential risk of adverse cardiovascular events, possibly including AMI, with drug exposure.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,eplerenone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to eplerenone in the context of adverse reactions, clinical trials experience, or post-marketing experience. The primary adverse reactions discussed are hyperkalemia and increased creatinine, particularly in the context of heart failure post-myocardial infarction (as evaluated in the EPHESUS trial) and hypertension.

The EPHESUS trial evaluated the safety of eplerenone in patients post-myocardial infarction with heart failure, where adverse reactions occurred at a similar rate to those of the placebo group, and the most common reasons for discontinuation of eplerenone were hyperkalemia, myocardial infarction, and abnormal renal function. However, myocardial infarctions leading to discontinuation were not specifically attributed to eplerenone exposure as an adverse reaction but are noted as reasons for discontinuation, which could be related to the patients' pre-existing heart conditions rather than a direct effect of the drug.

Regarding hypertension, though angina pectoris/MI were mentioned among the reasons for discontinuation of eplerenone, this does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between eplerenone and AMI. There may be other contributing factors, and the provided label sections do not articulate a clear causal link.

In the post-marketing experience section, while various adverse reactions have been reported, acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly listed.

In summary, the provided drug label sections do not offer evident support for a causal relationship between eplerenone exposure and acute myocardial infarction as a drug-related adverse reaction. Any occurrence of AMI in the clinical trial or post-marketing settings has not been clearly delineated as a direct adverse reaction to eplerenone but appears to be included as a condition potentially influencing drug discontinuation. Further in-depth review of the complete clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing reports may provide additional insights, but this would extend beyond the information provided in the drug label sections you have shared.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,epoetin alfa,1.0,"Epoetin alfa, marketed under the brand name PROCRIT, is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) used to treat anemia associated with various conditions, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chemotherapy-induced anemia. The evidence for the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and epoetin alfa administration comes from various research studies and post-marketing surveillance data. Below is a summary of the evidence:

1. Clinical Trial Experience:
   - In clinical trials with PROCRIT involving patients with CKD not on dialysis, myocardial infarction was reported as a serious adverse reaction that occurred in less than 5% of epoetin alfa-treated patients and at a greater frequency than in the placebo-treated patients (0.8% PROCRIT vs. 0% placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2. Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions:
   - Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL in patients with CKD increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including myocardial infarction [see Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
   - ESAs, including PROCRIT, increased the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including myocardial infarction, in patients with cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

3. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Postmarketing surveillance has also identified that myocardial infarction can occur in patients receiving epoetin alfa. However, because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

4. Mechanism of Action Consideration:
   - While the exact mechanism is not entirely clear, it is understood that increased hemoglobin levels and hematocrit due to epoetin alfa can lead to elevated blood viscosity, potentially causing or exacerbating hypertension and vascular thromboses, which can precipitate myocardial infarction.

5. FDA Recommendations:
   - The FDA recommends using the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and to carefully monitor hemoglobin levels to avoid exceeding recommended targets [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

In summary, evidence from clinical trial data, postmarketing surveillance, and the known pharmacodynamic properties of ESAs support a relationship between the use of epoetin alfa and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, particularly when targeting higher hemoglobin levels in certain patient populations. Healthcare professionals are advised to follow FDA recommendations regarding dosing and monitoring to mitigate these risks.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,erlotinib,,"Based on the drug label information provided, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction to erlotinib. Erlotinib is associated with various serious adverse reactions which are detailed in different sections of the labeling, and some of the most common adverse reactions include rash, diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue.

However, in the section detailing the pancreatic cancer study (Study 5), under severe adverse reactions (≥ Grade 3 NCI-CTC) with incidence rates of less than 5%, myocardial infarction/ischemia is mentioned as one of the observed events in patients treated with erlotinib plus gemcitabine. This indicates that there have been instances where myocardial infarction has occurred, although the incidence appears to be quite low.

Regarding the evidence hierarchy, clinical trials typically provide a level of evidence, but in this case, the myocardial infarction/ischemia adverse reaction seems to be a rare event rather than a common or well-characterized side effect of erlotinib.

Post-marketing surveillance often captures a broader range of less common or rare adverse reactions that may not have been fully observed in clinical trials due to smaller sample sizes or shorter duration of follow-up. The label does not provide specific post-marketing data on myocardial infarction related to erlotinib use.

In summary, while the drug label does not list acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction of erlotinib, it is mentioned under severe adverse reactions in a pancreatic cancer study with a low incidence. For a more definitive characterization of the relationship between AMI and erlotinib, further data from post-marketing surveillance, additional clinical studies, and case reports would be necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,escitalopram,,"The provided drug label for escitalopram does not explicitly report acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction either in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The sections relevant to adverse reactions, warnings, post-marketing experience, and use in patients with concomitant illnesses do not list AMI as a recognized complication of therapy with escitalopram. Instead, the label details various other potential adverse reactions and concerns, including those related to psychiatric, gastrointestinal, neurological, sexual, and other systems.

Cardiac disorders mentioned in the context of post-marketing experience include atrial fibrillation, bradycardi, cardiac failure, tachycardia, torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia. Myocardial infarction is listed among the cardiac disorders, indicating that there have been spontaneous post-marketing reports of such events. However, due to the nature of voluntary reporting and an uncertain population size, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of such events or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Therefore, while AMI is mentioned in the context of post-marketing monitoring, the evidence to establish a direct causal relationship between escitalopram treatment and the occurrence of AMI is not clear or robust based on the label information. Careful consideration and further investigation are necessary to determine if there is a true link between escitalopram and acute myocardial infarction. Clinicians are advised to monitor patients for any signs of cardiac distress, particularly those with a history of cardiac conditions as the label advises caution in patients with recent myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. 

Given that clinical trials generally have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, it's possible that patients with significant cardiac histories may have been excluded from these trials. As a result, post-marketing surveillance becomes a critical tool for observing adverse effects like AMI that might not have been apparent during clinical trials.

For a definitive summary linking escitalopram with AMI, one would normally look for explicit mentions in clinical trials, meta-analyses of clinical trial data, epidemiological cohort or case-control studies evaluating the risk of AMI with escitalopram use, or well-documented case reports that explore this relationship in detail. It is important for health care providers to report all suspected adverse reactions to pharmacovigilance systems like the FDA's MedWatch to enrich the post-marketing safety data.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,estradiol,1.0,"The available evidence for a relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of estradiol, specifically in the context of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) such as Natazia, is as follows:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: 
   In the section 6.1 of the drug label, it is noted that serious adverse reactions reported in clinical phase 3 trials of Natazia included myocardial infarction (2 cases). While the absolute numbers are provided, the label does not detail the incidence rate compared to a control group. Therefore, the information suggests a temporal association but is not sufficient to establish a definitive causal relationship between Natazia use and AMI.

2. **Postmarketing Experience**: 
   As documented in section 6.2, after the approval and wider use of Natazia, myocardial infarction has been identified as one of several serious adverse reactions reported. However, these reports are voluntary and without a specified frequency, which makes it challenging to accurately ascertain a causative link based exclusively on this data.

3. **Warnings and Precautions**: 
   The drug label warns about vascular risks associated with COCs in section 5.1, including an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboses (e.g., strokes and myocardial infarctions) particularly in women with risk factors for these events. Although these warnings indicate recognition of the risk, they apply generally to COCs and do not directly quantify the risk specifically for Natazia.

4. **Boxed Warning**: 
   The strongest warning on the label— the boxed warning— highlights that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, underscoring a well-established link between COCs, smoking, and cardiovascular events like AMI. The warning is particularly emphatic regarding women over 35 who smoke.

Although isolating the risk of AMI specifically to estradiol exposure from these documents is difficult, since COCs contain both estrogen (like estradiol) and a progestin, it is evident that there is an association between COC use and increased cardiovascular risks, which includes a potential risk of AMI. Full comprehension of the risk requires careful interpretation of the data including patient-specific factors such as age, smoking status, and underlying health conditions. Clinical judgment must integrate this complex information to evaluate the risk of AMI in individual patients considering or currently using COCs like Natazia.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,estradiol,1.0,"The evidence available for the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and estradiol exposure primarily comes from the large-scale Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies. It should be noted that while estradiol is a commonly used form of estrogen therapy, the WHI studies specifically investigated conjugated equine estrogens, which are a different formulation but of similar therapeutic class.

1. Clinical Trials: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 who were treated with daily oral conjugated estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate, compared to placebo. There was an increased risk (though not statistically significant) of coronary heart disease events, a category that includes myocardial infarction, for women receiving this combination therapy (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). However, this trial did not utilize estradiol, and the results apply to a different estrogen formulation which might have different risk profiles.

2. Postmarketing Experience: Pharmacovigilance and postmarketing surveillance data have been informative in understanding adverse reactions. For Minivelle (estradiol transdermal system), post-marketing experiences are documented, but specifics regarding myocardial infarction are not explicitly listed in the surveillance reports provided in the drug label. There are no reported cases of AMI directly attributed to estradiol exposure in the provided sections for Minivelle.

3. Warnings and Precautions: The drug label for Minivelle includes a boxed warning that reflects the findings of the WHI studies, highlighting an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stroke. Although myocardial infarction is not specifically mentioned, it is categorized under cardiovascular events which have been associated with estrogen therapies. Cardiovascular disorders are included as a general serious adverse reaction with estrogen therapy noted elsewhere in labeling.

4. Evidence from Other Sources: It's worth mentioning that other epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have investigated the link between estrogen therapy and cardiovascular outcomes, including AMI. While individual studies might suggest a relationship, results have been mixed and influenced by factors such as the type of estrogen preparation, the presence of progestin in combination therapies, dosing regimen, the timing of initiation post-menopause, and individual patient risk factors.

In summary, evidence from WHI studies and warnings based on those findings suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events with estrogen therapy, but direct evidence specifically linking estradiol (Minivelle) to acute myocardial infarction is not provided in the provided drug label sections. The relevance of WHI findings to estradiol might be inferred but cannot be considered conclusive without direct studies examining estradiol specifically. Clinical decisions should consider the individual patient's risk profile and the overall benefit-risk ratio of estrogen therapy.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,estramustine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between estramustine exposure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is a type of heart attack.

In a randomized, double-blind trial comparing therapy with estramustine (EMCYT) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the following cardiovascular adverse effects were reported among patients:

- Cardiac Arrest: EMCYT (0), DES (2)
- Cerebrovascular Accident: EMCYT (2), DES (0)
- **Myocardial Infarction: EMCYT (3), DES (1)**
- Thrombophlebitis: EMCYT (3), DES (7)
- Pulmonary Emboli: EMCYT (2), DES (5)
- Congestive Heart Failure: EMCYT (3), DES (2)
- Edema: EMCYT (19), DES (17)
- Dyspnea: EMCYT (11), DES (3)
- Leg Cramps: EMCYT (8), DES (11)
- Upper Respiratory Discharge: EMCYT (1), DES (1)
- Hoarseness: EMCYT (1), DES (0)

In this clinical trial involving a cohort of 93 patients treated with EMCYT (estradiol mustard) at a dosage of 11.5 to 15.9 mg/kg/day, there were three reported cases of myocardial infarction. In the DES-treated group (93 patients at a dosage of 3.0 mg/day), there was one reported case of myocardial infarction. Although the number of myocardial infarction cases was relatively low, the presence of such adverse events in the EMCYT-treated group suggests a potential association between estramustine exposure and the occurrence of AMI.

It is important to note that the number of AMI cases reported does not establish a causal relationship, but it does indicate the need for additional research, including further clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance to confirm and better understand this potential adverse effect. Additional factors such as the baseline cardiovascular risk of the patient population, the stage and type of cancer being treated, and concomitant therapies should also be considered when evaluating the cardiovascular risks associated with estramustine therapy.

In the absence of a larger evidence base specifically detailing a causal relationship between estramustine and AMI, caution should be exercised when interpreting these results. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for cardiovascular adverse effects and assess each patient's individual risk before prescribing estramustine.","NA

Based on the provided section of the drug label concerning adverse reactions from a randomized, double-blind trial comparing therapy with EMCYT (estramustine) Capsules and diethylstilbestrol (DES), myocardial infarction was reported in 3 out of 93 patients treated with EMCYT. This suggests a possible association between myocardial infarction and estramustine exposure. Therefore, there is no summarized evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction and drug exposure to estramustine within the given data."
acute myocardial infarction,estropipate,1.0,"After reviewing the sections provided from the drug label for estropipate, we can summarize the evidence related to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction as follows:

1. **Adverse Reactions:** The drug label lists myocardial infarction under the cardiovascular category of adverse reactions associated with estrogens and/or progestin therapy. This indicates that post-marketing experiences or clinical observations have reported myocardial infarction as a potential complication in patients using these hormones.

2. **Clinical Trials:** The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study is specifically cited in the warnings section of the label. The WHI study found an increased risk of myocardial infarction (as well as stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis) in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 during 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) when compared to placebo. While estropipate was not the estrogen tested in the WHI study, the label suggests that risks associated with conjugated estrogens combined with progestins may also be assumed for other estrogens, unless proven otherwise.

3. **Other Sources:** The drug label does not specify other sources, such as case studies, that provide additional evidence for the relationship between estropipate exposure and acute myocardial infarction.

4. **Assumed Similarity of Risk:** The label implies that while specific data on estropipate might not be available, similar forms of estrogen therapy, especially when combined with progestins, have shown increased cardiovascular risks in the WHI study. It suggests that such risks should be presumed similar for estropipate until more specific data are available.

5. **Estrogens and Cardiovascular Risk:** A general warning is given that estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, which indicates a recognized concern with the use of hormone therapy and cardiovascular risks.

In summary, while the label does not provide direct evidence from clinical trials or case studies specifically for estropiptate and acute myocardial infarction, it includes myocardial infarction as a reported adverse reaction and references general findings from the WHI study about the increased risk of cardiovascular events with estrogen-progestin therapy. As direct evidence for estropipate specifically is not cited, it is recommended for healthcare providers to consider the potential cardiovascular risks highlighted by studies of similar hormone therapies when prescribing estropipate.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,etodolac,1.0,"Evidence from the provided drug label of etodolac indicates that cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (acute myocardial infarction), are a recognized risk associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include etodolac. The label explicitly states that NSAIDs may increase the risk of such serious cardiovascular events, which can be fatal. This risk can manifest early in treatment and may escalate with the duration of use.

Post-marketing surveillance has captured myocardial infarction as an adverse event, although the label categorizes this under incidents where a causal relationship to etodolac is uncertain. This indicates that while instances of myocardial infarction have been reported following etodolac use, establishing a direct causal link from clinical trials is not definitive.

Furthermore, specific to etodolac, the label denotes that the drug is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to the increased risk of cardiovascular events, which serves as indirect support to the idea that etodolac may predispose patients to adverse cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction.

In summary, while myocardial infarction is listed under adverse reactions with an uncertain causal relationship to etodolac in the label, the well-documented risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use, the contraindication after CABG surgery, and post-marketing reports provide a basis to consider acute myocardial infarction a potential adverse reaction to etodolac. However, since direct causal evidence from controlled clinical trials is not specified, the association is acknowledged with caution. Health professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to regulatory authorities like the FDA, which can help to further elucidate the relationship between etodolac use and myocardial infarction through continued surveillance.","There is clear evidence listed in the drug label that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including etodolac, come with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke. This potential adverse reaction is acknowledged under the ""Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events"" section of the drug label. It states that this risk may occur early in the treatment and may increase with the duration of use. Additionally, the label mentions that etodolac tablets are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Given that the drug label explicitly lists myocardial infarction as a known risk of etodolac, primarily based on the class effect of NSAIDs, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and etodolac exposure provided in the provided drug label sections. In this case, it is not appropriate to suggest evidence refuting this relationship as the labeling itself acknowledges the risk.

The label's ""WARNINGS"" section also emphasizes the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. Therefore, refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and etodolac exposure is inconsistent with the already acknowledged and documented risks provided by the existing drug label.

acute myocardial infarction,etravirine,,"The evidence available from the provided drug label regarding the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of etravirine, an antiretroviral medication, is limited. Based on the adverse reactions section (6.1) of the drug label, AMI is listed under ""Less Common Adverse Reactions"" occurring in less than 2% of subjects (599 subjects) receiving etravirine tablets in clinical trials and is of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2). It is essential to note that recognizing a direct relationship between a drug and potential adverse reactions encountered in clinical trials can be challenging, as there may be confounding factors and comorbid conditions that complicate the analysis. Additionally, the incidence of a particular event in the treatment group should be weighed against what occurs in a comparable control group (if available), which in this case, is not specified for AMI.

In post-marketing experience (section 6.2), there is no specific mention of myocardial infarction being reported. The post-marketing period reveals real-world patient experiences and is essential for spotting less common or long-term side effects. However, reporting during this phase is voluntary and may not represent all cases.

Important to note from section 5 (Warnings and Precautions) of the drug label is that while severe and potentially fatal reactions are covered, and while cardiovascular events can be severe, they are not specifically highlighted in these sections. The absence of explicit mention of AMI in the warnings and precautions suggests that either the risk is not elevated to a level warranting a specific warning, or there is insufficient evidence to confirm a strong causal relationship between etravirine and the occurrence of AMI that would necessitate such a warning.

According to the provided sections of the drug label, there appears to be no specific warning concerning AMI, nor is a causal relationship thoroughly established through the clinical trial data mentioned or post-marketing reports cited. Thus, while there are indications that AMI has been observed in patients taking etravirine, the evidence does not robustly establish a clear and direct causal relationship. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment in assessing individual patient risk and consider other factors that may contribute to the risk of AMI in patients on etravirine therapy.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,etravirine,,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to etravirine is mentioned under the section ""Less Common Adverse Reactions"" within the clinical trials experience for adult subjects. It should be noted that the cardiac disorders listed include myocardial infarction alongside other conditions like angina pectoris and atrial fibrillation. However, the adverse reactions specified, including myocardial infarction, are reported to occur at a frequency of less than 2% of subjects receiving etravirine (INTELENCE). This indicates that, while myocardial infarction was observed in clinical trials, it was not among the more commonly reported adverse events. 

The available information suggests that myocardial infarction has been documented as an adverse event during clinical trials, but the low frequency of this event in the provided data suggests it is a rare occurrence. There is no detailed information given about the specific number of myocardial infarction cases or the circumstances under which they occurred. Furthermore, no causality between etravirine use and the occurrence of myocardial infarction can be established based on the provided information alone.  

No statement about AMI is provided in the post-marketing experience section, which means there is no additional evidence from this source linking etravirine to acute myocardial infarction after the drug's approval and broader public use.

To draw any solid conclusion about a causal relationship, one would need to consider more information, such as the patient's medical history, concurrent medications, and any underlying risk factors for cardiovascular disease that may have contributed to the occurrence of AMI. 

Additional source assessments, longitudinal studies, or case reports would be beneficial in further evaluating the possible association between etravirine and acute myocardial infarction. Clinicians should still remain vigilant for this rare but potential adverse event, even though the available evidence does not strongly suggest a common occurrence.","Based on the provided drug label sections for etravirine (INTELENCE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under ""Less Common Adverse Reactions"" occurring in less than 2% of subjects during clinical trials. This section indicates that AMI was observed during the clinical development of etravirine. However, the incidence is low and a causal relationship is not established simply by its occurrence in clinical trials.

To refute a relationship, there should be additional epidemiological data, meta-analyses, post-marketing surveillance reports, or specific clinical studies designed to assess the cardiovascular safety of etravirine that do not demonstrate an increased risk of AMI compared to control subjects or the general population. However, such specific evidence is not detailed within the provided sections of the drug label.

In the absence of further evidence explicitly refuting the relationship between etravirine and AMI, and considering that AMI is listed under the less common adverse reactions, it would be inappropriate to conclusively state there is no relationship. As such, with the information presented, the summary cannot simply state 'NA'; instead, it acknowledges that while AMI was observed, the drug label itself does not provide detailed evidence that would either confirm a causal link or conclusively refute it. Additional studies and post-marketing data would be needed to clarify this relationship."
acute myocardial infarction,everolimus,,"The provided drug label for everolimus (AFINITOR/AFINITOR DISPERZ) includes a comprehensive list of its associated adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings based on clinical trials and postmarketing experience. However, this label does not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a potential adverse reaction to everolimus.

The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities section of the label details common, serious, and grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed across various clinical trials involving different patient populations (e.g., breast cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, tuberous sclerosis complex-associated renal angiomyolipoma, etc.). These adverse reactions include stomatitis, infections, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, and many more. The grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities include hypophosphatemia, lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, and others.

The postmarketing experience does mention arterial thrombotic events as an identified adverse reaction, but AMI is not directly referenced.

Moreover, the warnings and precautions section addresses the risk of certain serious adverse reactions such as non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and metabolic disorders, among others. Although cardiac conditions are mentioned in the context of other events (e.g., cardiac failure with pulmonary hypertension in the non-infectious pneumonitis warning), AMI is not specifically cited as an observed adverse reaction.

Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicit evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and exposure to everolimus from these particular sections. It is possible that AMI could be encompassed under broader categories such as ""cardiac failure"" or ""arterial thrombotic events,"" yet without concrete data or a clear indication stated within the label, one cannot definitively conclude that AMI is an established adverse reaction linked to the use of everolimus.

It is important for healthcare professionals to report suspected adverse reactions, such as AMI if they occur, to regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA) to ensure ongoing safety monitoring and updates to drug labeling. In the absence of specific reports or trial data mentioning AMI in the context of everolimus, the connection remains unsubstantiated based on the provided information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,everolimus,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for everolimus, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a common or serious adverse reaction in the context of kidney or liver transplantation. The most frequent adverse reactions reported include peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, nausea, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia among others (Section 6.1 and 6.2). Serious adverse reactions discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label are also mentioned, such as hypersensitivity reactions, lymphomas, serious infections, kidney graft thrombosis, hepatic artery thrombosis, heart transplantation issues, angioedema, wound healing and fluid accumulation, interstitial lung disease, hyperlipidemia, proteinuria, polyoma virus infections, and thrombotic microangiopathy.

Specific mention of cardiovascular events includes increased risk of graft thrombosis and mortality related to cardiac conditions (Section 6.1 and 6.2). However, these descriptions do not explicitly cite acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction during clinical trials or post-marketing experience.

The post-marketing experience (Section 6.3) includes other adverse reactions not specific to transplant indications, like angioedema, which is also a cardiovascular event, but again, acute myocardial infarction is not specifically listed.

Warnings and Precautions (Section 5) and Boxed Warnings also do not list acute myocardial infarction as a known adverse reaction of everolimus.

In conclusion, there is no explicit evidence within the sections provided that acute myocardial infarction is a recognized adverse reaction of everolimus based on clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. It is important to consult the full prescribing information and scientific literature for the most up-to-date evidence and to report any suspected adverse events to the relevant authorities as indicated on the drug label. If new research or case reports become available suggesting a link between everolimus and acute myocardial infarction, it would be essential to review this evidence to determine any potential relationship.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for everolimus, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) being an adverse reaction attributed to this medication. The sections detail various common and serious adverse reactions associated with everolimus use, such as peripheral edema, constipation, hypertension, anemia, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia, among others. Additionally, the label describes serious risks such as malignancies, serious infections, kidney graft thrombosis, and increased nephrotoxicity when used with cyclosporine.

Post-marketing experience mentions several other conditions but does not include AMI. While there is an increased risk of vascular events and warnings about the proper management of immunosuppression that could theoretically relate to cardiac health, AMI is not explicitly mentioned within the context of the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data provided in the label.

In summary, the drug label for everolimus does not list acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction based on the available details from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance detailed in the provided sections. Therefore, there is no evidence within the provided information to suggest that everolimus is associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. If AMI were an observed adverse reaction, it would typically be included in the label; the absence of such information suggests that no clear link had been established at the time of data analysis up to my current knowledge cutoff in 2023."
acute myocardial infarction,exemestane,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for exemestane, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and exemestane exposure. This evidence comes from clinical trial data rather than case studies or post-marketing surveillance.

Specifically, within the IES study (Intergroup Exemestane Study), which evaluated postmenopausal women with early breast cancer, the incidence of cardiac ischemic events (which include myocardial infarction, angina, and myocardial ischemia) was higher in patients treated with exemestane (1.6%) compared to those treated with tamoxifen (0.6%). Additionally, the incidence of cardiac failure was also marginally higher in those taking exemestan (0.4%) as opposed to tamoxifen (0.3%).

The IES study was a well-controlled clinical trial and such findings provide direct evidence of the association between exemestane and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction among patients. These cardiovascular events were actively sought and monitored as part of the adverse reactions sections of the trials, reinforcing the strength of this evidence.

Moreover, the treatment-emergent adverse reactions and illnesses including all causalities and occurring with an incidence of ≥5% in either treatment group of the IES study during or within one month of the end of treatment are listed in Table 2, but the information specifically about myocardial infarction within this context is not detailed in the provided excerpt.

While clinical trial data is a powerful form of evidence due to its controlled environment, it is important to note that post-marketing experience can sometimes reveal additional adverse reactions when a drug is used in the broader population. However, there is no mention in the provided sections of the drug label of myocardial infarction being identified during post-marketing surveillance.

Thus, it can be concluded that there is clinical trial evidence supporting the relationship between exemestane exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infaraction, based on the IES study comparison between exemestane and tamoxifen. It is important for healthcare providers to consider this risk when prescribing exemestane, especially for patients with existing risk factors for heart disease.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,febuxostat,,"There is evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between febuxostat exposure and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Clinical Trials Evidence:
According to the drug label information provided, in a cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study known as the CARES trial, patients with gout and established cardiovascular disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of cardiovascular death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of these deaths. While febuxostat was similar to allopurinol in the rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization, the study reported an incidence of 2.7% of sudden cardiac death in the febuxostat group versus 1.8% in the allopurinol group.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label also indicates that there were reports of cardiac disorders such as angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation/flutter, palpitations, and other heart-related events post-approval, which can be associated with myocardial infarction.

Boxed Warning:
The drug label includes a boxed warning which highlights that patients with established cardiovascular disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of cardiovascular death than those treated with allopurinol. Physicians are advised to consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat, especially in patients with a history of heart disease.

Overall, while the drug label does not directly link febuxostat to acute myocardial infarction, it clearly states that febuxostat is associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular death, including sudden cardiac death, which can be a consequence of acute myocardial infarction. This information is derived from clinical trials data (CARES trial) and post-marketing surveillance, signaling that there is evidence for a potential relationship between febuxostat and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, which could include acute myocardial infarction. Health care providers should weigh the benefits and risks of using febuxostat in patients, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular disease.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,febuxostat,,"The evidence regarding the association of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with febuxostat (marketed as ULORIC) is embedded in the cardiovascular safety data and warning sections of the drug label. 

According to the provided sections of the drug label, during randomized controlled studies of febuxostat for the treatment of gout, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (which include MI, among other conditions) in patients treated with febuxostat compared to those treated with allopurinol. Specific to MI, the label indicates that in phase 3 randomized controlled studies, the incidences of adjudicated APTC (Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaborations, which includes non-fatal MI) events per 100 patient-years of exposure were as follows:

- Patients receiving febuxostat 40 mg: 0 events (95% CI 0.00-1.08)
- Patients receiving febuxostat 80 mg: 1.09 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0.44-2.24)
- Patients receiving allopurinol: 0.60 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0.16-1.53)
- Placebo: 0 events (95% CI 0.00-6.16)

In long-term extension studies, the incidences of adjudicated APTC events were:

- Patients receiving febuxostat 80 mg: 0.97 (95% CI 0.57-1.56)
- Patients receiving allopurinol: 0.58 (95% CI 0.02-3.24)

The evidence from these controlled trials suggests that there may be a higher rate of MI events in patients taking febuxostat compared to those taking allopurinol or placebo, although the confidence intervals are wide and overlap, indicating uncertainty about the true incidence rate.

The drug label emphasizes that there is no established causal relationship between febuxostat and MI, but it advises monitoring for signs and symptoms of both MI and stroke. 

No data from case studies or post-marketing surveillance specific to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to febuxostat are provided in the sections of the label quoted. The label indicates that postmarketing experience encompasses a broader range of adverse reactions such as hepatic failure, skin reactions, and blood disorders, but does not specifically mention acute myocardial infarction in the postmarketing section.

In summary, clinical trial data shows a higher incidence rate of cardiovascular events, including non-fatal MI, for febuxostat compared to allopurinol and placebo, but no definitive causal relationship has been established. Clinicians are advised to monitor for cardiovascular signs and symptoms during febuxostat treatment. Postmarketing data on acute myocardial infarction specifically related to febuxostat is not detailed in the sections provided.",N/A
acute myocardial infarction,felodipine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for felodipine, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under the ""Body as a Whole: Cardiovascular"" section among other serious adverse events that occurred at lower rates or events reported during post-marketing experience. However, it is important to note that the relationship of these events to administration of felodipine extended-release tablets is uncertain.

The evidence for AMI as an adverse reaction comes from post-marketing surveillance, as the incidence and causality in relation to felodipine use were not firmly established in the controlled clinical trials. Clinical trials primarily reported more common, non-serious adverse events such as peripheral edema, headache, and flushing, but did not present acute myocardial infarction as a frequent adverse reaction at the recommended dosage range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day.

In summary, although acute myocardial infarction is mentioned as an adverse event observed during the post-marketing experience of felodipine, the evidence does not establish a clear causal relationship between its occurrence and the administration of the drug. Such reporting indicates need for awareness but does not equate to definitive evidence for causality. As adverse event reporting in post-marketing surveillance is voluntary and can be influenced by various factors, the actual relationship may be subject to confounding variables and requires further investigation to establish causation. As this relationship is not clearly defined, healthcare providers should monitor for cardiovascular events but should also consider other patient-specific factors and comorbidities that may contribute to the risk of AMI. Additional studies or case reports may be useful in further clarifying this potential relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,fenofibrate,,"Based on the provided drug label information for fenofibrate, there is no direct evidence that explicitly lists acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to fenofibrate. The clinical trials and post-marketing experiences mentioned in the label do not indicate AMI as a direct adverse reaction to the drug. 

Clinical Trials:
- The ACCORD Lipid trial showed a non-significant relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular disease death) with fenofibrate combined with statin therapy, as compared to statin monotherapy.
- The FIELD study demonstrated a non-significant relative reduction in coronary heart disease events and a significant reduction in the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events with fenofibrate compared to placebo. However, there was a non-significant increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality with fenofibrate as compared to placebo.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- The post-marketing experience section of the label reports voluntarily submitted adverse reactions, but AMI is not listed among these reactions. Adverse reactions like myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and others are noted, but again, not AMI.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The label contains warnings for venothromboembolic disease (including PE and DVT) based on findings from the FIELD trial, but no specific warning for AMI.

Therefore, based on the information from the drug label, there is no direct evidence to support a causal relationship between fenofibrate and acute myocardial infarction. Clinical studies mention cardiovascular outcomes, but they are not framed as adverse reactions to fenofibrate; rather, they refer to the drug's efficacy in reducing such events or to mortality associated with them. No case studies specifically linking fenofibrate to AMI were provided in the label information. 

Any healthcare professional concerned about the potential cardiovascular effects of fenofibrate should refer to the most recent clinical guidelines, consider the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile, and review the most current and robust scientific data available. It is also prudent to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events as part of good clinical practice, particularly in patients with predisposing factors.","NA

The sections provided from the drug label of fenofibrate do not mention acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction in the context of clinical trials or post-marketing experience. Additionally, the evidence from the ACCORD Lipid trial and the FIELD study discussed in the warnings section does not establish a direct relationship between fenofibrate and AMI. The FIELD study did not show a significant difference in coronary heart disease mortality, and while the ACCORD Lipid trial did observe a non-significant relative reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with fenofibrate plus statin combination therapy compared to statin monotherapy, it did not provide evidence of fenofibrate being a cause of AMI. 

Therefore, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is an adverse reaction related to fenofibrate. However, it should be noted that absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence, and healthcare providers should stay vigilant for new data that may emerge."
acute myocardial infarction,fenoldopam,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for fenoldopam, the evidence to support acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction includes mentions under section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience. Within this section, myocardial infarction is listed among the cardiac disorders with an incidence from 0.5% to 5% in patients treated with fenoldopam. This indicates that there have been instances where myocardial infarction was observed in clinical trial participants who received fenoldopam. However, the exact frequency within this range and the details of how this compares to a control group (if present) or to the incidence in the general population are not provided in your excerpt. Additionally, it is not specified whether the myocardial infarctions were definitively linked to fenoldopam exposure or if they were coincidental.

There is no mention of acute myocardial infarction in the box warnings or the post-marketing experience section (6.2 Post-Marketing Experience). Therefore, it appears that while myocardial infarction has been reported in clinical trials involving fenoldopam, there is not a strong enough body of evidence to warrant a black box warning or a more definitive statement of causality in the label.

When evaluating the relationship between drug exposure and adverse events it's important to consider the mechanism of action of the drug, patient populations, and clinical context. Fenoldopam is a dopamine receptor agonist that induces peripheral vasodilation, which can lead to rapid drops in blood pressure and compensatory cardiac effects, such as tachycardia. Whether these hemodynamic changes could precipitate an AMI in certain susceptible individuals (e.g., those with preexisting coronary artery disease) is a plausible concern.

Moreover, post-marketing surveillance data is subject to underreporting and often lacks the robustness that randomized controlled trials provide. Consequently, while myocardial infarction has been reported during clinical trials with fenoldopam, this summary does not provide substantial evidence to conclusively establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Additional information from large-scale, controlled studies would be needed to accurately quantify this risk and firmly establish causality.

In summary, myocardial infarction has been observed in clinical trials with a reported incidence between 0.5% and 5% of patients treated with fenoldopam, but the data presented does not include detailed context or comparison with control groups that would allow for a robust assessment of causality. Therefore, while there is some evidence of myocardial infarction occurrence, the relationship with drug exposure is not conclusively established based on this drug label information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ferumoxytol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to suggest an association between acute myocardial infarction and the administration of ferumoxytol from the post-marketing experience. Here is the summarized evidence:

Clinical Trials:
The clinical trial data provided in the sections of the drug label do not specifically mention acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction. The adverse reactions (≥1%) listed in the IDA Trials 3, IDA Trial 1 and 2, and CKD Trials, primarily included symptoms like headache, nausea, dizziness, and hypotension, among others. Serious adverse events were reported in a small percentage of patients, but acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly stated in these sections of the provided label.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The post-marketing experience, which represents real-world data from a broader and more diverse patient population, has reported serious adverse events related to the use of ferumoxytol. These include ""acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction or with in-stent thrombosis in the context of a hypersensitivity reaction."" Such reactions usually occurred within 30 minutes following the administration of ferumoxytol and are not restricted to the first dose. It is important to note that voluntary reports of adverse reactions do not always provide enough data to establish a definitive causal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event due to the uncertain size of the reporting population.

Boxed Warnings:
The boxed warnings emphasize the risk for serious hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions, which can manifest as severe cardiovascular symptoms, including cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, and syncope. While these warnings focus primarily on anaphylaxis, cardiovascular reactions such as acute myocardial ischemia can occur in this context. 

Comparative data with another intravenous iron, ferric carboxymaltose, did show cardiac-related serious adverse events such as congestive heart failure and angina pectoris, suggesting that intravenous iron therapies can have cardiovascular adverse effects. However, the specifics of acute myocardial infarction were not mentioned for ferumoxytol in these comparative data.

In summary, acute myocardial infarction is not listed among the most common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials of ferumoxytol. However, post-marketing surveillance data indicate reports of acute myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction, often in the setting of a hypersensitivity reaction. It is important to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions when administering ferumoxytol due to the potential severity of these adverse events, including the risk of acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,filgrastim,,"Based on the extensive information provided, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction in any of the reported results from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance within the sections provided from the drug label for filgrastim. Adverse reactions and warnings are focused on various other serious conditions, such as splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome, serious allergic reactions, sickle cell disorders, glomerulonephritis, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, cutaneous vasculitis, and aortitis, among other effects.

6.3 Postmarketing Experience section and 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS identify other adverse reactions and concerns reported during post-approval use of filgrastim products, but acute myocardial infarction is not listed among them.

Based on the evidence and sources provided, there is no known documentation or indication that connects filgrastim use with acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction within any of these sections of the drug label. If such a relationship exists, it would not be evidenced by the information provided here. Further investigation, including a review of more recent literature, would be necessary to conclusively determine whether there is any emerging evidence of AMI being associated with filgrastim.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,filgrastim,,"The clinical trial information and post-marketing experience detailed in the drug label for filgrastim (under the brand name GRANIX) do not specifically list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction. The adverse reactions section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience and 6.2 Postmarketing Experience) mentions various side effects such as splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), serious allergic reactions, glomerulonephritis, capillary leak syndrome, and leukocytosis, among others. However, AMI is not included as a known adverse reaction either in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance as detailed in this provided labeling information.

The most common adverse reactions reported are bone pain, myalgia, headaches, vomiting, cutaneous vasculitis, and thrombocytopenia, yet there is no mention of AMI. While adverse events such as aortitis and certain cardiovascular reactions could theoretically contribute to increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to note that a direct causal relationship with AMI is not established in the available data from this labeling information.

If acute myocardial infarction is suspected to be an adverse reaction to filgrastim, further investigation and research would be needed to establish a clear link, including a detailed examination of patient case reports, clinical trial data, and larger epidemiological studies that could reveal such an association if it exists. As of the information you've provided, there is no known evidence in the scientific literature or clinical trial data directly supporting acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of filgrastim.","NA

There is no mention of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to filgrastim in the provided drug label sections. The label lists various other potential serious adverse reactions and common adverse events associated with filgrastim use, but acute myocardial infarction is not included among them. If new evidence emerges or further studies are conducted, it is important to refer to the most current drug labeling and peer-reviewed studies for updates on adverse reactions associated with filgrastim."
acute myocardial infarction,flecainide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of flecainide can be inferred from various sections of the drug label but is not directly stated as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions section of the label describes instances of death and non-fatal cardiac arrest in post-myocardial infarction patients receiving flecainide compared to those who received a placebo, suggesting an increased risk when the drug is used in this population.

From the provided label sections:

1. Clinical Trials: Mortality data from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) included flecainide among the tested Class IC antiarrhythmic agents. There was an increased rate of mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest in patients treated with flecainide (5.1%) compared to a matched placebo group (2.3%). These patients were treated on average for ten months, and all had a history of myocardial infarction and asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

2. Adverse Reactions: There are reports of proarrhythmic events, which include new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias in 7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmias like premature ventricular contractions and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Most proarrhythmic events (80% of cases) occurred within the initial 14 days of therapy initiation.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance: Rare instances of ventricular proarrhythmic effects were noted in the world literature for patients treated with flecainide for atrial fibrillation or flutter, leading to increased PVCs, VT, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and death.

The drug label sections indicate that flecainide can cause or exacerbate arrhythmias, which can be fatal and may lead to cardiac arrest. While the label does not explicitly list AMI as an adverse reaction, the increased risk of fatal arrhythmic events, including those post-myocardial infarction, suggests an indirect relationship.

The label advises against the use of flecainide in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation due to the risk of proarrhythmic effects, and the mortality associated with flecainide in the CAST study supports this caution. It is essential to consider these risks in patients with recent myocardial infarction and to assess the benefits and risks of therapy with flecainide in such individuals.

It is important to note that while the evidence points toward an increased risk of fatal arrhythmias following myocardial infarction in patients treated with flecainide, this does not directly equate to evidence that flecainide causes acute myocardial infarctions. The label indicates an increased rate of mortality and cardiac arrests, which could be secondary to its proarrhythmic effects rather than a direct cause of AMI.","NA 

The provided drug label sections explicitly document a relationship between flecainide use and adverse cardiac outcomes, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), in certain populations. Evidence from the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) indicates an increased mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate in patients treated with flecainide when compared to placebo. Therefore, there is no evidence to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and flecainide exposure; instead, there is evidence supporting this relationship."
acute myocardial infarction,fludarabine,,"The provided drug label sections on fludarabine include detailed information about various adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions associated with the medication's use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other conditions. However, within this extensive information, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a documented adverse reaction attributed to fludarabine based on clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance.

Specifically, within the cardiovascular section (section 6.7 of the drug label), reported cardiovascular adverse reactions include edema, pericardial effusion, heart failure, arrhythmia, and myocardial infarction. However, myocardial infarction is noted without a specific incidence rate or explicit association as an adverse reaction to fludarabine. This suggests that although there have been reports of myocardial infarction, it is not characterized as a common or well-established adverse reaction attributable to fludarabine therapy in the clinical trial setting.

Moreover, the boxed warnings and other sections focus on severe bone marrow suppression, neurotoxicity, hemolytic anemia, pulmonary toxicity, and autoimmune reactions amongst other adverse effects, but they do not provide evidence for a direct relationship between fludarabine use and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction.

Given the current information provided from the drug label excerpts, we cannot conclusively state that there is a clear and supported evidence-based relationship between acute myocardial infarction and fludarabine exposure. Therefore, while myocardial infarction has been mentioned in post-marketing reports, it is not established as a definitive adverse reaction caused by fludarabine in the available medical literature associated with the drug label. Health professionals should continue to monitor patients on fludarabine for any signs of cardiovascular issues, as with any other medications, and report new cases to further evaluate this potential association. 

For a conclusive determination, a thorough review of the latest clinical data, case reports, and relevant pharmacovigilance databases would be necessary. If you have more specific information or data sources you would like to be evaluated, please provide them for a more tailored assessment.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,fluorouracil,,"As of my last update, there is evidence to suggest that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapy drug, can be associated with cardiotoxicity, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Here is the summary of available evidence:

**Clinical Trials**: Clinical trials involving fluorouracil have documented cases of cardiac side effects. Cardiotoxicity has been observed in 1.2% to 18% of patients receiving 5-FU, depending on the dosing regimen and method of administration. Manifestations range from asymptomatic ECG changes to life-threatening conditions, including myocardial infarction. Continuous infusion rather than bolus dosing appears to have higher cardiotoxicity rates.

**Case Studies**: Numerous case reports and case series in the medical literature describe the occurrence of AMI during or shortly after 5-FU treatment. These cases help establish a temporal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse cardiac events.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Post-marketing reports, which include voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and patients, further substantiate the association between 5-FU and AMI. These reports often lack detailed clinical information but indicate the possible occurrence of myocardial infarction after drug exposure in the broader population outside of clinical trials.

**Mechanism of Action**: The proposed mechanisms for fluorouracil-induced cardiotoxicity include coronary vasospasm, direct myocardial toxicity, thrombogenic effects, and autoimmune reactions, though the exact pathophysiology is not fully understood.

It is important to note that the excerpts from the drug label provided do not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction as a recognized adverse reaction. However, this does not preclude the evidence from clinical studies, case reports, and post-marking surveillance that suggests an association.

Conclusively, while myocardial infarction is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the specific sections of the drug label provided, substantial clinical and post-marketing evidence supports a relationship between fluorouracil exposure and acute myocardial infarction. It's crucial for healthcare providers to monitor for signs of cardiotoxicity, and patients should be informed of the potential risks before initiation of fluorouracil therapy.

Physicians and patients are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the medication’s manufacturer or the FDA. Further research may provide additional insights into the incidence, mechanisms, and management of this serious adverse reaction.

The adverse reactions listed for fluorouracil do not include acute myocardial infarction. The sections provided focus on local reactions, systemic hematological and gastrointestinal effects, and other miscellaneous side effects. There is no mention of acute myocardial infarction being associated with the use of fluorouracil. Therefore, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is an adverse reaction of fluorouracil. It is important to consult the full prescribing information and peer-reviewed literature for a comprehensive understanding of all potential adverse reactions."
acute myocardial infarction,fluoxetine,,"Based on the extensive information provided from the drug label of fluoxetine, there is no direct evidence cited within clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data associating fluoxetine with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction.

According to the reported clinical trials data, the adverse reactions with an incidence of at least 5% for fluoxetine and at least twice that for placebo across multiple indications did not include AMI. The reported adverse reactions primarily involved the body as a whole, the cardiovascular system (specifically vasodilatation), digestive system, nervous system, respiratory system, skin and appendages, and urogenital system. Reported reactions in the cardiovascular system consisted of vasodilatation but did not mention myocardial infarction.

The post-marketing experience section, which aggregates voluntary reports of adverse reactions, also did not list AMI among the reactions. There were mentions of serious cardiovascular events like atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, heart arrest, and QT prolongation that could theoretically be associated with ischemic heart disease but no specific mention of AMI.

The warnings and precautions section of the drug label does include an expanded discussion on various risks, such as QT prolongation (which is a heart rhythm condition that could be related to heart function), but does not explicitly mention AMI as a recognized risk or adverse event associated with fluoxetine use. While QT prolongation can be associated with serious cardiac events, it is a distinct entity from myocardial infarction.

Given the lack of data or mention within this detailed drug labeling information, there is no known evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance to support a direct relationship between fluoxetine exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. However, it's important to always consider that post-marketing surveillance could potentially reveal rare adverse events that were not documented in clinical trial data due to the larger and more diverse patient population being exposed to the medication after its approval. Therefore, continuous monitoring and reporting of adverse events during post-marketing surveillance are crucial.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,flurbiprofen,1.0,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution, which primarily relate to its ocular application, there is no direct evidence presented that suggests a relationship between the use of flurbiprofen and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) listed under adverse reactions. The adverse reactions mentioned focus on ocular side effects such as transient burning, stinging, irritation, fibrosis, hyphema, miosis, mydriasis, ocular hyperemia, and increased bleeding tendency of ocular tissues in surgery.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which flurbiprofen is a part of, have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, in some studies, particularly when used at high doses and for long-term treatment. This is primarily a concern with systemic administration (oral or injectable forms) rather than ophthalmic solutions. However, the evidence specifically linking flurbiprofen eye drops to acute myocardial infarction is not detailed in the provided drug label sections.

To determine if there is a known link between flurbiprofen (especially in forms other than ophthalmic) and AMI, a search for additional sources such as extensive clinical trial data, epidemiological studies, case reports, and comprehensive post-marketing surveillance results would be appropriate. Such documentation might be found in medical journals or databases like PubMed or by contacting regulatory agencies such as the FDA that might have more extensive data including rare adverse reactions not listed in the basic product labeling.

As an AI language model, I do not have access to databases to conduct this search. Should those more extensive searches not yield any documented evidence of acute myocardial infarction being triggered by the use of flurbiprofen, especially its ophthalmic form, it would be appropriate to state that there is no known evidence for such a relationship at this time. However, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions, so the label invites reporting of any unusual adverse events which may then be investigated further.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,fluvoxamine,,"The evidence provided in the drug label for fluvoxamine does not establish a direct relationship between fluvoxamine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. While the label extensively details common and infrequent adverse reactions observed in both adult and pediatric populations during clinical trials, as well as postmarketing reports, AMI is not listed among them.

The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with fluvoxamine in controlled clinical trials for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression are gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms such as nausea, somnolence, insomnia, and nervousness. Sexual dysfunction and weight changes are also noted as frequent reactions. Postmarketing reports identify a wide range of adverse reactions, including serious ones such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and serotonin syndrome, but again, AMI is not reported as a known adverse effect.

Given that AMI is not highlighted in the sections covering adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings in the drug label, there appears to be no known evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that fluvoxamine exposure leads to AMI. Additionally, the sections discussing contraindications and precautions do not address any cardiovascular concerns that would suggest an association with AMI.

Therefore, based on the available information provided from the drug label sections presented, acute myocardial infarction is not a recognized adverse reaction of fluvoxamine. It is important to review the latest clinical literature and pharmacovigilance data regularly, as new information may emerge that could affect this assessment.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,fondaparinux,,"Based on the label provided, acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction to fondaparinox; most notably, it does not appear in the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section or the ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" sections. The primary adverse reactions associated with fondaparinux are bleeding complications, as highlighted in the clinical trials section (6.1) and supported by the information provided in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4.

The fondaparinux sodium label specifies that the most serious adverse reactions related to its use are bleeding complications, including major and minor bleedings detailed in multiple tables showing the rate of these events across various clinical studies. While bleeding is a key focus, information about potential increases in serum aminotransferases (6.3) is included, which could affect the interpretation of myocardial infarction owing to similar changes in such enzyme levels occurring during heart attacks.

There's mention of the risk for bleeding in relation to body weight (5.4), renal function (5.3), and concomitant use with other drugs affecting hemostasis (5.2). Also noted is the potential for thrombocytopenia (5.5), a condition that can cause bleeding or clotting issues but is different from myocardial infarction.

As myocardial infarction is not listed in the sections relating to known adverse reactions or explicitly connected to fondaparinux use in the provided labeling, there is no available evidence from these materials to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is a recognized adverse reaction of the drug.

It is important to note that absence of mention in the label does not necessarily mean that there is no possible relationship, as post-marketing surveillance sometimes reveals new adverse reactions after longer-term or broader exposure to a medication in a diverse patient population. However, based on the provided label information, there is no current evidence to support a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the administration of fondaparinux. 

To draw definitive conclusions about such a relationship, further investigation, such as an examination of case reports, epidemiological studies, or more extensive post-marketing surveillance data, would be required. If such evidence existed, it could provide a more detailed analysis of the association between fondaparinux and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,fosamprenavir,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for fosamprenavir, there is mention of myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction within the postmarketing experience section (6.2 Postmarketing Experience). Specifically, it is stated:

""Cardiac Disorders: Myocardial infarction.""

This suggests that instances of myocardial infarction have been reported in patients taking fosamprenavir after the drug was approved and available on the market. Postmarketing surveillance often captures adverse events that may not have been apparent in clinical trials due to the larger and more varied population that uses the medication after approval.

However, the statement does not provide specific details regarding the frequency of these reports or establish a clear causal relationship between fosamprenavir exposure and the occurrence of myocardial infarction. It is important to note that postmarketing reports are voluntary and the actual size of the affected population is unknown, making it difficult to reliably estimate the frequency or to establish a definitive causal link to drug exposure.

No such evidence of myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to fosamprenavir is reported in the clinical trials section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) or the laboratory abnormalities tables (Tables 4 and 5), which focus on common adverse reactions and lab abnormalities from the controlled environments of clinical trials.

In absence of detailed evidence such as the incidence rate, comparator statistics, or established causality from clinical trials, the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and fosamprenavir remains a potential adverse reaction based on postmarketing reports, warranting further investigation and vigilance during clinical use.

Clinicians prescribing fosamprenavir should continue to report any suspected adverse reactions to the relevant authorities, such as Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch, to accumulate more data that could clarify this potential association.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,fosinopril,,"The provided label sections for fosinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, document various adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance in patients treated for hypertension and heart failure. Among these, acute myocardial infarction (MI) is mentioned as one of the cardiovascular adverse events noted under the ""General"" section, with the qualifier ""probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy."" It is classified in the same category as other cardiovascular events such as angina, cerebrovascular accidents, and hypertensive crises.

The label indicates that acute myocardial infarction falls into the category of adverse events that occurred with an incidence of >1% in fosinopril-treated patients but with a lower or equal frequency compared to the placebo group during controlled clinical trials. Although reported, the label does not suggest a prominent or dose-related increase in the incidence of MI with fosinopril compared to placebo.

In an analysis of both hypertension and heart failure trials, no specific data or incidence rate is provided solely for MI. It is important to note that during clinical trials, adverse event reporting does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but rather an association observed during the study period.

The label clearly states that no myocardial infarctions were frequent enough to prompt discontinuation of fosinopril during clinical trials. Moreover, chest pain in general (which could encompass angina or symptoms associated with MI) was noted, and only a small proportion of patients (1.1%) discontinued treatment due to angina pectoris in placebo-controlled heart failure trials.

The evidence of the relationship between fosinopril and acute myocardial infarction is based on clinical trial observations, categorized as potentially related to the drug but without clear causality and at an incidence rate comparable to that seen with placebo. Additionally, post-marketing surveillance reporting does not seem to elevate the concern of MI as a prominent adverse event.

Given that the labeling does not specify a higher frequency of myocardial infarction associated with fosinopril compared to placebo, nor provides robust causation data, the evidence suggesting that acute MI is an adverse reaction directly attributable to fosinopril is not conclusive.

To comprehensively determine the relationship between fosinopril and the occurrence of myocardial infarction, more targeted epidemiological studies and post-marketing data focusing on this specific adverse event would be necessary. It is essential to interpret such label information within the broader context of patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and the background rate of myocardial infarction in the relevant patient populations.","Based on the provided sections from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) - an alternate term for a heart attack - is listed under cardiovascular clinical adverse events that are ""probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy,"" and it is mentioned as having occurred in patients treated with fosinopril sodium in clinical trials. However, the fact that it is listed does not necessarily establish causation; it merely acknowledges that AMI was observed during the studies. No direct evidence refuting the relationship between AMI and fosinopril sodium exposure is provided in the label excerpts shared.

To definitively refute the relationship between AMI and fosinopril, one would require evidence from well-designed studies or clinical trials showing no significant difference in the incidence of AMI between patients receiving fosinopril and those on placebo or alternative treatments, after controlling for relevant confounders. Other supportive evidence could include mechanistic studies demonstrating that fosinopril does not have a plausible biological pathway to cause AMI. Neither of these types of evidence is mentioned in the text provided.

To summarize, the provided drug label sections do not contain any direct evidence refuting the potential relationship between fosinopril sodium exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. More comprehensive research, perhaps through a systematic review of the literature or a meta-analysis of relevant clinical trials, would be needed for a conclusive statement. As of the information available up to this point, the relationship between AMI and fosinopril cannot be definitively refuted."
acute myocardial infarction,frovatriptan,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and drug exposure to frovatriptan includes clinical trial data and post-marketing reports detailed in the drug's labeling. Frovatriptan is a selective 5-HT1 agonist used in the treatment of migraine headaches.

Within the clinical trial experience (Section 6.1 of the drug label), chest pain was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event following administration of frovatriptan 2.5 mg in at least 2% of patients, and at an incidence of 1% greater than with placebo. However, the trials did not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction.

The Warnings and Precautions (Section 5) indicate that there have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, following the administration of frovatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients who had no known history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Section 5.1 specifically notes that myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal’s angina can occur with frovatriptan use, suggesting that the drug may cause coronary artery vasospasm. The label cautions about the use of frovatriptan in patients with known or suspected CAD or vasospastic reactions, advising a thorough cardiovascular evaluation before administrating the drug to patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. It also states that frovatriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD.

Post-marketing experience (Section 6.2) confirmed the occurrence of serious cardiac adverse reactions. Since such events are voluntarily reported from an unknown population size, the frequency and causality are less clear, but they provide supportive evidence of the potential risk.

To summarize, the clinical trial data included in the drug label mention chest pain but do not directly report incidents of AMI. However, the label's Warnings and Precautions and post-marketing surveillance information indicate that acute myocardial infarction has been reported in association with frovatriptan use. Due to the possibility of frovatriptan causing coronary vasospasm, caution and further cardiac evaluation are recommended for at-risk patients, reinforcing the evidence of a relationship between frovatriptan and AMI.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,gabapentin,,"Upon reviewing the relevant sections provided for gabapentin, particularly under the brand name HORIZANT, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse effect in the adverse reactions, warnings, or postmarketing experience sections. The details provided focus on adverse reactions such as somnolence/sedation, dizziness, headache, and other side effects that were observed in clinical trials or reported during postmarketing surveillance.

In the clinical trials experience detailed in the sections provided, the most common adverse reactions for gabapentin administration in Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) were neurological and gastrointestinal in nature. Somnolence, dizziness, and headache were the most frequently reported effects. Other adverse reactions were also noted but were generally related to the central nervous system or gastrointestinal disturbances.

The postmarketing experience lists additional adverse reactions that have been reported after the approval of the drug, such as breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, bullous pemphigoid, and life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression when taken with opioids or CNS depressants. However, acute myocardial infarction is not listed among those adverse reactions. It’s worth noting that postmarketing reports are based on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, and it may not always be possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no known evidence specifically linking acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to gabapentin. However, this does not definitively rule out such a relationship, as not all adverse reactions may be reported or identified. Should more detailed searches of the medical literature or further data from clinical trials or epidemiological studies suggest otherwise, it would be important to consider such evidence in the context of the currently available information.

For completeness, and to provide the most accurate summary, a thorough literature review and analysis of clinical trial data, case studies, and regulatory databases would be required to assert whether there is any established association between gabapentin and acute myocardial infarction outside of the information provided in the drug label. If any new evidence emerged, it would be vital for healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies to assess the data and determine if a causal relationship exists.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,gabapentin,,"The provided drug label for gabapentin does not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a known adverse reaction either in the section covering clinical trials experience or in the post-marketing experience. The reported adverse reactions from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance of gabapentin focus on CNS-related effects such as somnolence, dizziness, and ataxia, as well as other diverse effects including peripheral edema, infection, and gastrointestinal symptoms. 

However, there is mention in section 5.1 of the drug label of myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can in some cases be associated with AMI. Myocarditis is discussed within the context of a multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). It is noted that DRESS can be fatal or life-threatening, and while it is not directly stated that DRESS leads to AMI, there could be a potential indirect association through severe myocarditis.

As for AMI being a direct adverse reaction to gabapentin, no clear evidence supporting this relationship is provided in the drug label's detailed adverse reactions information. Other sections, like warnings and precautions, also do not directly list AMI as a potential outcome of taking gabapentin. 

To summarize, based on the provided drug label for gabapentin, there is no listed evidence that AMI is a recognized adverse reaction of gabapentin exposure in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. Should there be case reports or additional research studies outside the scope of this label indicating such a relationship, a more detailed review of those specific sources would be necessary to evaluate the evidence.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,gemcitabine,,"The summary of evidence regarding the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and gemcitabine exposure can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Gemcitabine, when used as a single agent at doses between 800 mg/m^2 to 1250 mg/m^2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly in a total of 979 patients with various malignancies, resulted in a range of adverse reactions, which are listed in the clinical trials section of the product labeling.
- Acute myocardial infarction was mentioned specifically as an adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in 2% of these 979 patients. This is a direct indication of an association between gemcitabine and acute myocardial infarction for these patients.
- The clinical trials, therefore, provide evidence that myocardial infarction can occur as an adverse effect of gemcitabine treatment.

Post-Marketing Experience:
- In the post-marketing surveillance section, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, are identified as adverse reactions that have been observed.
- While the post-marketing data is based on voluntary reports and does not permit reliable estimation of frequency or a definitive establishment of causal relationship, the identification of myocardial infarction in this section supports the evidence found in clinical trials.

No specific case studies detailing individual incidences of acute myocardial infarction related to gemcitabine were provided in the excerpt.

In summary, clinical trials highlight myocardial infarction as an adverse event leading to discontinuation in a small percentage of patients. The acknowledgment of myocardial infarction in the post-marketing surveillance data adds to this evidence. However, it is also important to note the inherent limitations of post-marketing data in estimating frequency and establishing causality.","Evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and gemcitabine exposure is not explicitly stated in the drug label sections provided. While AMI is mentioned as one of the cardiovascular adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in 2% of the 979 patients, this information does not inherently refute the possibility of AMI as a potential adverse reaction linked to gemcitabine treatment.

In assessing the available information from clinical trials, AMI appears as one of several cardiovascular adverse reactions that led to the discontinuation of treatment in a small percentage of patients. The provided sections emphasize more common adverse reactions and toxicities associated with gemcitabine, which include myelosuppression, pulmonary toxicity, and renal impairment, among others. However, the relationship between AMI and gemcitabine cannot be conclusively disputed based solely on the provided drug label information.

For a definitive evaluation of the evidence refuting the relationship between the occurrence of AMI and gemcitabine, a thorough review of the literature, including clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports that specifically investigate the incidence of AMI in the absence of gemcitabine treatment, would be necessary.

Without detailed data and studies directly investigating the relationship between AMI and gemcitabine, a conclusive statement cannot be made to refute the potential adverse reaction of AMI from gemcitabine exposure based on the sections of the drug label provided. Thus, more comprehensive analysis and targeted research would be needed to make a clear refutation."
acute myocardial infarction,glatiramer,,"Based on the sections provided from the drug label, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction in the context of controlled clinical trials, or in post-marketing experience for glatiramer acetate injection. It is important to note that AMI is distinct from the general ""chest pain"" that is described as an adverse reaction in both the clinical trials and the post-marketing experience. The evidence does reveal that chest pain can be an adverse reaction and occurs in some patients, with an incidence of approximately 13% in glatiramer acetate injection 20 mg per mL patients in placebo-controlled studies, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial. However, this chest pain is typically noted as transient and without identified clinical sequelae.

In post-marketing surveillance, myocardial infarction is mentioned once in a comprehensive list of adverse reactions reported during postapproval use of glatiramer acetate injection. However, because these reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a cause-and-effect relationship to drug exposure. 

In summary, while chest pain is a recognized adverse reaction associated with glatiramer acetate injections and could theoretically be related to AMI, there is no explicit evidence in the provided clinical trial and post-marketing data to establish a definitive link between glatiramer acetate exposure and acute myocardial infarction. To make such a connection, more detailed investigation and specific reporting focused on AMI as an adverse reaction would be required.","NA

Limited by the information provided, there appears to be no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an identified adverse reaction of glatiramer acetate in either the controlled clinical trials or post-marketing experience sections provided. The listed cardiac disorders in the clinical trials were palpitations, tachycardia, and chest pain, and in the post-marketing experience, instances of myocardial infarction were mentioned, but no causal relationship to drug exposure was established or refuted.

If you require further investigation, a more comprehensive review of the scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and additional post-marketing surveillance reports may be necessary to definitively confirm the absence of AMI as an adverse reaction to glatiramer acetate."
acute myocardial infarction,goserelin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ZOLADEX (goserelin), there is no direct evidence within the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings explicitly linking acute myocardinal infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to goserelin exposure. 

Within the ""6.2 Prostatic Carcinoma"" section discussing adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, myocardial infarction was mentioned as an adverse event reported in greater than 1% but less than 5% of patients treated with ZOLADEX. This indicates that while there have been reports of myocardial infarction in this patient population, it was not among the most common adverse events, and the drug label does not establish a direct causal relationship between ZOLADEX therapy and the onset of AMI.

The ""5.4 Cardiovascular Diseases"" warning does mention an increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke reported in association with the use of GnRH agonists in men. However, the label indicates that the risk appears to be low based on reported odds ratios, and cardiovascular risk factors should be evaluated when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. This suggests that while there may be an association, definitive evidence of a causal relationship between goserelin and AMI might not be established or may not be strong.

Additionally, according to ""6.10 Postmarketing Experience,"" cardiovascular events such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack have been observed in post-marketing settings with the use of GnRH agonists. It is noted, however, that causality is uncertain due to the presence of concomitant risk factors and medication use among reported cases.

In summary, while myocardial infarction has been reported in patients treated with ZOLADEX, the evidence as presented in the drug label does not clearly establish a causal relationship between goserelin exposure and acute myocardial infarction. Reports of such events have been observed both in clinical trial settings and post-marketing surveillance, but the presence of other risk factors and lack of causation data make it difficult to definitively attribute AMI to goserelin use alone.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,guanfacine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct evidence within clinical trial data or the listed adverse reactions to suggest that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a recognized adverse reaction to guanfacine. The adverse reactions section details common side effects associated with guanfacine, such as dry mouth, somnolence (sleepiness), weakness (asthenia), dizziness, constipation, and impotence, as well as less common ones like skin rash and others. It also mentions dose-related frequency of these reactions and reasons for dropout in trials due to adverse effects.

However, in the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section, myocardial infarction is listed as one of the rare, serious disorders that have been reported. Although these are serious events, the language used (""Rare, serious disorders with no definitive cause and effect relationship to guanfacine have been reported"") indicates that a clear, causal relationship between guanfacine exposure and the occurrence of AMI has not been established. These reports are postmarketing, meaning they are observations made after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use. Such observations can be subject to reporting biases and lack the controlled conditions of a clinical trial.

In summary, while myocardial infarction is mentioned as a serious event reported in the postmarketing experience with guanfacine, there is no established evidence from clinical trials or controlled studies to definitively link guanfacine exposure with the occurrence of acute myocardial infarctions. Therefore, while a potential link cannot be fully discounted due to postmarketing reports, there is insufficient evidence to assert a causal relationship. Healthcare professionals rely on continued post-marketing surveillance and further studies to better understand the safety profile of medications and any potential rare adverse effects.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,hydralazine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for hydralazine, specifically the adverse reactions, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse reaction. Instead, the label lists various other cardiovascular adverse effects such as palpitations, tachycardia, hypotension, and angina pectoris. Angina pectoris, which is chest pain due to ischemia of the heart muscle, could theoretically be related to more severe ischemic events like AMI; however, the provided label does not explicitly make this connection.

As for clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, the summary does not include any specific references, studies, or reports that link hydralazine directly to acute myocardial infarction. Taking this into account, we can infer that there may not have been enough systematic data collection or significant findings to support the claim that hydralazine is directly associated with the occurrence of AMI.

Without explicit data from research studies or reported cases that establish a causal relationship between hydralazine use and acute myocardial infarction, it is important not to draw such a conclusion. Furthermore, the occurrence of AMI is multifactorial, and while drug-induced mechanisms could contribute, they usually need to be rigorously demonstrated through research, which does not seem to be the case here based on the drug label information.

In conclusion, according to the provided sections of the drug label for hydralazine, there is no clear evidence presented that suggests a direct association between hydralazine and acute myocardial infarction. If research on this relation exists, it has not been included or indicated in the summary of the drug label provided. For the most accurate and current evidence, additional examination of clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing reports would be necessary.","NA

The provided drug label sections for hydralazine (Adverse Reactions, Warnings, and Box Warnings) do not list acute myocardial infarction as a known adverse reaction. Therefore, given the context of this query and the information provided, there is no evidence to refute; acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse effect of hydralazine according to the provided drug label information."
acute myocardial infarction,hydrocortisone,,"Evidence Regarding Acute Myocardial Infarction as an Adverse Reaction to Hydrocortisone:

The information provided from the drug label for SOLU-CORTEF (hydrocortisone) does not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a direct adverse reaction. However, it does mention cardiac-related adverse reactions including myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction, which suggests that exacerbations following an existing heart condition could potentially occur. Additionally, several cardiovascular adverse reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and others are reported.

In terms of the specific relationship between hydrocortisone exposure and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, the evidence from the label does not directly establish this connection. The presence of cardiac-related side effects indicates potential risk factors for cardiovascular stress, which could theoretically contribute to or exacerbate a myocardial infarction, especially in patients with underlying conditions.

While the label does not provide conclusive evidence for AMI as a direct adverse reaction to hydrocortisone, the cardiovascular risks associated with corticosteroid use are well-documented. For example, the effects on fluid and electrolyte disturbances, such as sodium retention and hypertension, may pose a risk for patients with compromised cardiovascular function.

Clinical Trials and Case Studies:
Unfortunately, the sections provided do not include specific references to clinical trials or case studies that directly link the use of hydrocortisone to acute myocardial infarction. Without detailed data from clinical trials, it is difficult to ascertain the level of risk associated with this specific adverse reaction.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing surveillance can often reveal adverse effects that are not evident in clinical trials due to the broader and more varied patient population. Nonetheless, no specific evidence from post-marketing surveillance is mentioned in the provided sections of the drug label.

Conclusion:
Based on the drug label information for SOLU-CORTEF provided, there is no direct evidence that associates acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction to hydrocortisone. While there is mention of myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction and various cardiovascular adverse events, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction caused by the drug. As always, it's crucial to recognize that patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions may be at increased risk when exposed to systemic corticosteroids like hydrocortisone, and regular monitoring is advised. For a definitive summary of the evidence, a thorough review of the entire drug label, clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing reports would be necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ibuprofen,,"Based on the drug label excerpts you have provided, evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is as follows:

1. **Boxed Warning on Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events**: The label explicitly mentions that NSAIDs, which includes ibuprofen, carry an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, comprising myocardial infarction and stroke, potentially fatal. This increased risk can occur early in the course of treatment and may rise with the duration of use.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: Although specific statistics or studies are not mentioned in the provided text, the inclusion of such a warning typically relies on post-marketing surveillance data. Adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction would have been observed and reported sufficiently to warrant inclusion in this warning.

3. **Clinical Data Implications**: While the label does not provide direct evidence from clinical trials that link ibuprofen to AMI, the Boxed Warning indicates that such a relationship has been observed through accumulated data. Clinical trials often do not have the statistical power to detect rare adverse events, and their frequency and association with the drug can become more apparent when the medication is used by a broader population after approval.

4. **Category of Adverse Effects**: The label does not list AMI in the categorized adverse reactions, likely because it is subsumed under the broader and more general 'Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events' warning in the boxed section.

5. **Literature and Research Studies**: The warning about cardiovascular risks associated with ibuprofen and other NSAIDs is supported by a considerable amount of research published in medical journals that fall outside the label information provided. Literature has reported an association between NSAID use and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, especially with long-term use, high dosages, or in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors.

6. **Regulatory Decisions**: The presence of a Boxed Warning, which is the FDA's strongest warning, underscores the significance of the risk and reflects regulatory decisions based on a comprehensive review of available evidence from multiple sources.

In summary, the drug label for ibuprofen indicates there is a probable causal relationship between ibuprofen use and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, as reflected in the Boxed Warning for serious cardiovascular thrombotic events. This is consistent with the evidence accumulated from post-marketing surveillance data and supported by a body of scientific literature, despite specific clinical trial data not being detailed in the provided label sections.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ifosfamide,,"Acute myocardial infarction is listed under ""CARDIAC DISORDERS"" in the postmarketing experience section of the drug label for ifosfamide. According to the provided information, myocardial infarction is a recognized adverse reaction during the post-approval use of ifosfamide, based on voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and patients. Due to the nature of postmarketing surveillance, the exact frequency of this adverse event and a definitive causal relationship to ifosfamide exposure cannot be reliably estimated from these data alone.

Clinical trials and other sections of the label provided do not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction (occurring in ≥ 10% of patients). The adverse reactions from clinical trials focus on other issues such as myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, and urotoxicity. However, cardiotoxicity including events like congestive heart failure and tachycardia are noted to have occurred in about 0.5% (7/1317) of patients based on reports from clinical trials. It is important to recognize that postmarketing reports often provide more extensive insight into potential adverse reactions due to the larger, more diverse population exposed to the drug compared to the originally studied clinical trial population.

The cardiac risk of ifosfamide is discussed in the ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" section, where it states that cardiotoxicity manifested as various cardiac disorders, including myocardial infarction, can occur and result in death. The risk of cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent and higher in patients with prior cardiac disease or those also receiving other cardiotoxic agents or chest radiation therapy.

In summary, postmarketing experience has identified myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction linked to ifosfamide exposure. The evidence for the relationship comes from postmarketing voluntary reports rather than from controlled clinical trials. Cardiotoxicity as a general concern is reflected in the warnings section of the label, indicating that ifosfamide should be used cautiously in patients with risk factors for cardiotoxicity. As such, myocardial infarction is recognized as a potentially serious complication of ifosfamide therapy in the broader patient population beyond the scope of initial clinical trials.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,imatinib,,"Evidence relating acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to imatinib is not explicitly provided in the provided drug label sections. The drug label details numerous potential adverse reactions associated with imatinib use, including various forms of edema and serious fluid retention events, hematologic toxicity (such as anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), cardiac events (congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction), hepatotoxicity, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal issues, and dermatologic toxicities, among others. Specific cardiac-related adverse effects mentioned include palpitations, pericardial effusion, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac arrest, and reports of arrhythmia and cardiac tamponade post-marketing.

Heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction are reported, particularly in patients with underlying heart conditions or those with specific risk factors for cardiac complications. Instances of severe fluid retention, for instance, pulmonary edema, have been noted, which could, in theory, stress the heart, but acute myocardial infarction as a discrete event is not cited as a side effect in the information provided.

It must be noted that adverse events potentially leading to myocardial infarction indirectly, such as severe fluid retention or left ventricular dysfunction, are listed. However, without specific mention or direct evidence linking acute myocardial infarction to imatinib use, it cannot be concluded that there is a directly supported relationship between this specific adverse reaction and the drug exposure based on the given drug label sections.

Healthcare professionals are usually encouraged to report adverse reactions to the drug manufacturing company or through the FDA MedWatch program. It could be that post-marketing surveillance might capture rare or long-term adverse events like acute myocardial infarction that may not have appeared in clinical trials. Since myocardial infarction is a serious event, any suspected relationship to drug exposure would likely warrant an investigation and necessary updates to the drug label.

As per the evidence provided from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction is not listed explicitly as an adverse reaction of imatinib. If further data is available outside of the drug label such as case studies or post-marketing surveillance that provides evidence of acute myocardial infarction occurring due to imatinib exposure, it is not included in the information given for this summary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,imipramine,1.0,"The provided drug label sections for imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, list acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) as one of the potential adverse reactions under the ""Cardiovascular"" category. This signals that there is recognition that myocardial infarction can occur in patients taking imipramine. However, the label also makes it clear that not all the listed adverse reactions may have been reported with imipramine specifically, due to the pharmacological similarities with other tricyclic antidepressants.

It is important to note that, although myocardial infarction is listed on the drug label, the frequency or causality of this adverse event in relation to imipramine is not detailed in the provided sections. Inclusion in a drug label indicates that there has been some report or plausible mechanistic pathway linking the drug to the adverse event, but without specific data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance, it is difficult to precisely evaluate the strength of this relationship.

The drug label mentions both adverse reactions observed during clinical trials and a post-market experience section, which includes voluntarily reported adverse reactions. As myocardial infarctions are listed in the 'adverse reactions' section rather than the 'postmarketing experience' section, it can be inferred that this serious adverse event may have been identified during the clinical development of the drug or recognized in the medical literature. However, without direct evidence or references from clinical studies, case reports, or reliable post-marketing data, it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the evidence supporting a causal relationship.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse reaction to imipramine on the drug label, indicating a potential relationship between imipramine exposure and this serious event, the document provided does not offer specific study data, case study information, or post-marketing surveillance data to assess the incidence, causality, or context of this relationship. For a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence, a thorough review of clinical studies, case reports, and post-marketing data from other sources would be required. If such information were available, it would be referenced with regard to the methodology and findings to convey the rigor and relevance of the evidence.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,imiquimod,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial experience for the treatment of either actinic keratosis or external genital warts with imiquimod. The most frequent side effects reported in these trials were local skin reactions, headaches, fatigue, nausea, and influenza-like illness.

However, under the section ""6.3 Postmarketing Experience,"" it is indicated that myocardial infarction has been reported during the post-approval use of imiquimod. These postmarketing experiences are voluntarily reported and come from a population of uncertain size, making it difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a clear causal relationship to imiquimod exposure.

Given that the postmarketing data is not as robust or controlled as data from clinical trials, the evidence supporting a direct relationship between imiquimod use and AMI remains tenuous and requires further investigation. There is a recognized potential for adverse cardiovascular effects, but without more detailed data or a higher incidence reported in controlled trials, the connection is not definitively established.

As such, while there have been reports of AMI in the postmarketing surveillance of imiquimod, caution is advisable when interpreting this information. Health professionals should remain vigilant for any signs of cardiovascular distress in patients using imiquimod, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular disease, and report any suspicions of adverse reactions to the appropriate pharmacovigilance systems to help establish a clearer picture of the drug’s safety profile.","Based on the provided drug label sections for imiquimod, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under section 6.3 as a postmarketing experience. This category includes adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of the drug. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is often challenging to establish a reliable estimate of their frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In the context of refuting the relationship between AMI and imiquimod exposure, the label's clinical trial data (sections 6.1 and 6.2) do not report AMI as an observed adverse reaction during the trials for actinic keratosis or external genital warts. The absence of AMI in the clinical trials suggests that there was no direct evidence of this serious adverse event linked to the drug during those study conditions.

Yet, it is important to consider that postmarketing experiences can signal potential rare or long-term effects not captured in the controlled environments of clinical trials. Clinical trials often have limitations, such as small sample sizes, shorter durations, and selected patient populations, which may not reveal all potential adverse reactions.

The mention of AMicrobial in the postmarketing surveillance period indicates that some patients taking imiquimod have experienced this event, but without further details on the circumstances, it's not possible to affirmatively refute the relationship. While the label does not specify the frequency or establish a direct causality, the fact that AMI is listed implies that there have been instances where it was reported after imiquimod use.

To conclusively refute the relationship between imiquimod and acute myocardial infarction, further investigation such as large-scale epidemiological studies, case-control studies, or a robust meta-analysis of available data would be needed. Only if such studies were to consistently demonstrate no association, could a refutation be considered reliable.

In summary, while the evidence from clinical trials does not report acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to imiquimod, its inclusion in the postmarketing experience implies reports of its occurrence in patients following drug exposure. A clear refutation would require additional detailed evidence not provided here."
acute myocardial infarction,indinavir,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is post-marketing evidence linking the use of indinavir (marketed as CRIXIVAN) to cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction (MI) and angina pectoris. Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, involves the interruption of blood flow to a part of the heart, causing heart cells to be damaged or die.

The relationship between indinavir and acute myocardial infarction is not described in the clinical trials section; the adverse reactions cited from clinical trials primarily include nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, and other metabolic and gastrointestinal issues. However, in the post-marketing experience section, myocardial infarction is listed among the cardiovascular system adverse reactions reported.

It is important to note that post-marketing reports do not necessarily establish a causal relationship between drug exposure and adverse event, as these reports can be voluntary, lack details, and often have missing or incomplete information about the patient's medical history, concomitant medications, and other risk factors that could contribute to the adverse event. These reports do bring attention to potential adverse reactions but require further investigation to confirm causation.

Since the sections provided do not include specific data or detailed case study outcomes, the strength of the evidence from the post-marketing surveillance supporting the relationship between indinavir exposure and MI cannot be fully assessed. While there is an indication of a possible link, it should be considered as a signal that may warrant further research, such as controlled epidemiological studies or detailed case reports, to understand the extent of the risk and the mechanisms involved. Additionally, healthcare providers should be vigilant and consider the cardiovascular risk profile of patients when prescribing indinavir. 

For a more comprehensive evaluation, one would need to review the scientific literature, including any observational studies, meta-analyses, or case reports that may provide stronger or confirmatory evidence of the relationship between indinavir exposure and acute myocardial infarction.","NA

The provided label sections for the drug indinavir (CRIXIVAN) list various adverse reactions, clinical trial outcomes, and post-marketing surveillance experiences. However, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to indinavir either in the context of clinical trial results or in post-marketing experience, which suggests that there is no established evidence linking indinavir to AMI within the provided sections.

It is worth noting that the post-marketing experience does include some cardiovascular system adverse events such as myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, but these are reported without frequency and without a definitive causal relationship to the drug. Such associations, lacking clear evidence or a basis for refutation, can arise incidentally or due to concomitant risk factors in patients.

To refute a relationship between an adverse reaction and drug exposure, one would provide evidence that includes well-conducted epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trials, or large-scale meta-analyses showing no statistically significant association between a given drug and the purported adverse event, compared to an appropriate control group. No such evidence is provided here.

The absence of mention of AMI as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials and listed posts marketing surveillance does not, by itself, constitute evidence refuting the relationship. To claim refutation, additional comprehensive studies specifically investigating the lack of relationship between indinavir and AMI would be required."
acute myocardial infarction,insulin glargine,,"The provided drug label sections for insulin glargine do not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a known adverse reaction from clinical trial experiences, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. Adverse reactions commonly associated with insulin glargine include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain, according to Section 6.1 of the drug label. Also, Section 6.3 (Postmarketing Experience) does not mention AMI among the adverse reactions identified after approval.

Moreover, none of the tables provided from Sections 6.1 and 6.3, which list various adverse reactions from clinical trials, include AMI as an observed adverse event for patients treated with this specific insulin formulation. The warnings and precautions section (Section 5) does not explicitly mention AMI but cautions about hypokalemia, which can result in ventricular arrhythmia and possibly increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as AMI. However, this is a general risk associated with insulin use and not specifically linked to insulin glargine.

It is important to note that while individual case reports or studies not included in this summary might suggest a link, this summary is limited to the information provided from the drug label sections, and based on that, there is no reported evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance directly linking insulin glargine to acute myocardial infarction. Any potential risk of AMI associated with insulin glargine would need to be investigated through further clinical research and analysis of real-world data. If there has been newer research or emerging data since my last update, it would not be included in this summary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,irbesartan,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for irbesartan, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse reaction from irbesartan exposure in the context of hypertension or diabetic nephropathy treatment. The clinical trials experience outlined in section 6.1 of the label does not report AMI as an adverse event occurring at a higher incidence in irbesartan-treated patients compared to the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions reported were hyperkalemia, dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension.

Further, in the postmarketing experience section 6.2, while adverse reactions like urticaria, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, and liver function disturbances are identified, AMI is not listed among them. These postmarketing reports are voluntary and the actual frequency of these adverse reactions is unknown, but they are not necessarily indicative of widespread or significant associations.

Given the absence of evidence in the provided sections of the drug label, we can conclude that, as of the knowledge cutoff for this evaluation, acute myocardial infartection is not an established adverse reaction to irbesartan based on clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data featured in the label.

For absolute confirmation, a review of the latest scientific literature and reports from drug regulatory agencies would be necessary to determine if any new evidence has emerged linking irbesartan with AMI. Without this information, the summary of evidence based on the provided sections of the drug label indicates no known association between AMI and irbesartan use.","In reviewing the evidence presented in the provided drug labeling sections for irbesartan, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse reaction to the drug during clinical trials or post-marketing experience. However, the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence; to refute a potential link between irbesartan and AMI, one would ideally cite large-scale epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, or post-marketing surveillance data that specifically investigate the incidence of AMI in patients taking irbesartan compared to a control population not taking the drug.

The clinical trials described in the labeling focused on common adverse reactions including hyperkalemia, dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension among patients with hypertension or type 2 diabetic nephropathy. The trials did not report AMI as a frequent adverse event in the irbesartan-treated groups compared to placebo. Additionally, the post-marketing experience does not list AMI among the voluntarily reported adverse reactions.

While the drug label provides evidence that AMI was not a reported adverse reaction during clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance for irbesartan, this is not definitive evidence that refutes the possibility of AMI as an adverse reaction. For a conclusive refutation, additional research and data examining the relationship between irbesartan and AMI would be required. As such, no evidence from the drug label refutes the relationship between AMI and irbesartan. It is important to consider that drug labels and post-marketing surveillance are not exhaustive and rare adverse reactions or those with delayed onset may not be captured."
acute myocardial infarction,irinotecan,,"Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence described in the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that links acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to irinotecan treatment (marketed as ONIVYDE). The adverse reactions that are detailed and discussed extensively in the different sections of the drug label for ONIVYDE include severe neutropenia, severe diarrhea, interstitial lung disease, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and other common adverse reactions such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, decreased weight, and various laboratory abnormalities. Additionally, serious adverse reactions and fatal adverse reactions, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke), hemorrhage, pneumonia, sepsis, and sudden death, are listed.

However, acute myocardial infarction is not mentioned in any of the sections provided from the drug label, including the clinical trials experience (NAPOLI-1 and NAPOLI-3) and the postmarketing experience. Since acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction or serious side effect, we can infer that it was either not observed, not reported in the patient population studied with statistical significance, or not considered to be directly related to irinotecan treatment based on the available data.

It's important to note that while specific evidence linking irinotecan to acute myocardial infarction isn't provided, this does not unequivocally confirm the absence of such a relationship, as post-marketing surveillance could possibly reveal rarer adverse events not captured in clinical trials. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the manufacturer or the FDA, which can lead to identification of additional risks associated with a drug after it has been marketed.

To summarize, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicitly reported evidence to support a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and irinotecan exposure from the clinical trials and postmarketing data currently available.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,iron sucrose,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction and exposure to iron sucrose (Venofer) can be found in the post-marketing experience of the drug. According to the drug label provided, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction, or with in-stent thrombosis in the context of a hypersensitivity reaction, has been identified as an adverse reaction during post-approval use of Venofer. This information is based on voluntary reports from individuals treated with the drug, and therefore it may not reflect the frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship due to the uncertain size of the reporting population.

In the clinical trials stated in the label, the documented adverse reactions most commonly included gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), headaches, hypotension, and musculoskeletal complaints such as arthralgia and back pain. Acute myocardial infarction is not listed among the prevalent adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials, which comprised a total of 445 patients with different types of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It should be noted that patients with CKD are often at higher risk for cardiovascular events due to their underlying health condition, which may confound the relationship between drug exposure and acute myocardial infarction. 

Furthermore, the label includes a warning about the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions and hypotension, which have been observed in patients receiving iron sucrose and could potentially lead to cardiovascular complications. However, no direct causality is established between iron sucrose and acute myocardial infarction based on these clinical observations.

It's also worth mentioning that adverse reactions may be related to the rate of drug administration and the patient's underlying health conditions. The label recommends observing patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity and hypotension, and calls for monitoring hematologic and iron parameters to prevent iron overload, which could contribute to cardiovascular risks.

In conclusion, while the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to iron sucrose is reported in post-marketing surveillance, it does not appear to be a common or well-documented outcome of iron sucrose administration based on available clinical trial data. These post-marketing reports suggest a possible relationship, but due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the lack of a controlled environment, the evidence is insufficient to definitively establish a causal link. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant about the potential for serious cardiovascular events during treatment with iron sucrose, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,isoflurane,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as a potential adverse reaction observed in the post-marketing experience with isoflurane, under the cardiac disorders section. However, this does not indicate a definitive causal relationship between isoflurane exposure and AMI, because post-marketing reports are often voluntary and lack a consistent method for collecting data. 

The occurrence of AMI is mentioned alongside other cardiac events like myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and various forms of heart blocks. Despite its inclusion in post-marketing reports, it's important to note that these adverse reactions are not quantified, and the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure is not reliably estimable with the data provided.

Clinical trials usually offer more controlled environments to detect adverse reactions, including randomized protocols and systematic monitoring. The label does not report AMI as an observed adverse reaction within the controlled clinical trial environment.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction has been reported as an adverse reaction in post-marketing surveillance of isoflurane, there are no specific details regarding its incidence, nor is there evidence from controlled clinical trials provided to support a direct causal relationship. Further investigation, rigorous post-marketing surveillance, and well-designed observational studies would be necessary to better assess the risk of AMI with isoflurane exposure.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,isopropyl alcohol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence to suggest a relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the exposure to isopropyl alcohol as an adverse reaction via the drug discussed (adalimumab, with the trade name ABRILADA).

The adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) and warnings sections of the label discuss various clinically significant adverse reactions and cautions for the use of adalimumab, which include serious infections, malignancies, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, neurologic reactions, hematological reactions, and others. However, AMI is not listed among them.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions of adalimumab in clinical trials were infections, injection site reactions, headache, and rash. Other serious adverse events were noted in the clinical studies (such as serious infections and tuberculosis), and less common reactions were reported in more specific patient groups (such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis studies). There were also mentions of cardiac disorders like heart failure, but acute myocardial infarction specifically was not reported as an observed adverse reaction in these studies.

Furthermore, post-marketing experience (section 6.3) describes additional adverse reactions identified after approval. Some of these include various other organ system disorders, but again, no direct mention of AMI related to isopropyl alcohol exposure is provided.

It is also important to clarify that while isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a rubbing alcohol and sometimes present in medical and cosmetic products, the mention herein pertains to a drug label specifically for adalimumab, and any potential relationship between isopropyl alcohol and AMI would be unrelated to this drug label content.

To summarize, according to the provided drug label information, there is no known evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and exposure to isopropyl alcohol as an adverse reaction of adalimumab (ABRILADA).",NA
acute myocardial infarction,isosorbide,,"Based on the provided drug label for isosorbide, the summary of the evidence is as follows:

The frequency of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials for isosorbide was documented in a table showing the incidence of various side effects in patients from 6 placebo-controlled studies. Among these, the most common adverse reaction reported was headache, which decreased in incidence after the first few days of therapy. Other adverse reactions with a frequency of 1% or more included fatigue, upper respiratory infection, pain, dizziness, nausea, increased cough, rash, abdominal pain, allergic reaction, cardiovascular disorder, chest pain, diarrhea, flushing, emotional lability, and pruritus.

Importantly, the section titled ""Other adverse reactions"" lists acute myocardial infarction as one of the adverse reactions reported by fewer than 1% of exposed patients. It is important to note that the relationship of these rarer adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, to drug treatment is uncertain, as they were reported infrequently and may not have a clear causal connection to the drug.

There is no data reported in the label from post-marketing surveillance specifically regarding acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to isosorbide.

In summary, acute myocardial infarction has been documented as an adverse reaction in fewer than 1% of patients in controlled clinical trials, but the evidence does not clearly establish a causal relationship with isosorbide due to its low incidence and the uncertain relation to the drug. There is a lack of specific mention of supporting evidence from post-marketing surveillance for acute myocardial infarction associated with isosorbide use. Therefore, based on the provided label, there is minimal evidence to suggest a clear association between isosorbide and acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction, and further investigation would be needed to confirm any potential causality.

To report suspected adverse reactions, the label provides contact information for Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.","The evidence provided from the drug label indicates that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under adverse reactions that occurred in fewer than 1% of patients exposed to isosorbide in clinical trials. The list also mentions that in many cases the relation to drug treatment was uncertain. This infers that while AMI has been reported, there is no clear causal relationship established between the occurrence of AMI and the administration of isosorbide based on the provided data.

No further evidence such as detailed clinical trial data, statistical analyses, or post-marketing surveillance studies specifically refuting the relationship between isosorbide and acute myocardial infarction is included in the provided information. Therefore, based on the available evidence from the drug label, a definitive refutation of the relationship cannot be confirmed.

For a conclusive statement, access to more detailed clinical data and a thorough evaluation of reported cases would be required. It remains important to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate drug safety authorities, as stated in the drug label, to help establish and refine the safety profile of medications post-approval."
acute myocardial infarction,isradipine,,"Based on the details provided from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as one of the adverse reactions to isradipine, which appears under the section of serious events from hypertension studies or other data sources, including post-marketing exposure. The explicit mention of myocardial infarction suggests that there have been observations or reports of this adverse event in patients treated with isradipine. However, it is important to note that the label indicates that the relationship of these adverse events to isradipine administration is uncertain.

Therefore, while AMI is reported as an adverse event in association with isradipine use, the causality is not definitively established. This could be due to the occurrence of AMI being a rare event, or it may be that confounding factors (such as pre-existing cardiovascular conditions in patients taking isradipine) make it difficult to ascertain the direct relationship.

The evidence comes from different sources, including controlled hypertension studies, other condition studies, and post-marketing surveillance. There is no detailed breakdown of the incidence or specifics of the clinical circumstances under which AMI was reported in relation to isradipine; hence, we cannot assess the strength of this association beyond the fact that it has been observed and reported. Clinical context, patient health status, dosage, and treatment duration might all play roles in the potential development of adverse reactions, including AMI.

In summary, myocardial infarction is mentioned as one of the potentially serious adverse reactions to isradipine based on hypertension studies and post-marketing experience. However, causality is not confirmed, and the evidence does not allow for a precise estimate of the risk. Further research, such as well-designed epidemiological studies, would be necessary to establish a causal relationship between isradipine use and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction more definitively. For healthcare professionals and patients, this underscores the importance of monitoring for cardiovascular symptoms and carefully considering the risk-to-benefit ratio, especially in individuals with other cardiovascular risk factors.","NA

Based on the information provided from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the adverse reactions section of the drug label for isradipine, there is mention of myocardial infarction as a rare adverse event. However, the explicit evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and isradipine exposure is not provided in the text you've shared. To make determinations about causality or lack thereof, a detailed investigation considering factors such as the frequency of the adverse event compared with the background rate in the population, temporal relationship, rechallenge data, and biological plausibility would typically be required. As such information is not included in the provided text, a specific refutation of the relationship based on evidence cannot be concluded from the data at hand."
acute myocardial infarction,ixabepilone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence of cardiac adverse reactions associated with the use of ixabepilone, which is a chemotherapy drug used primarily in the treatment of breast cancer. The specific evidence connecting acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to ixabepilone includes:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   The label states that in clinical studies involving ixabepilone as either a single agent or in combination with other therapies in 1323 patients, several cardiac disorders were reported, including myocardial infarction, supraventricular arrhythmia, left ventricular dysfunction, angina pectoris, atrial flutter, cardiomyopathy, and myocardial ischemia. However, the exact rates of these individual cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, are not provided in the summary.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   No specific post-marketing adverse reactions related to acute myocardial infarction were noted in the label sections provided. Typically, post-marketing surveillance can reveal adverse reactions that were not detected during clinical trials due to the broader and more diverse patient population exposed to the medication after approval.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   In section 5.5, the label warns about cardiac adverse reactions such as myocardial ischemia and ventricular dysfunction. It specifies that 1.9% of patients receiving ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine and 0.3% as a single agent experienced cardiac adverse reactions, without explicitly stating the percentage for AMI. Monitoring is advised for patients with a history of cardiac disease, and consideration for discontinuation of ixabepilone should be given if cardiac ischemia or impaired cardiac function develops.

Concluding, the information provided indicates a recognized link between ixabepilone and various cardiac disorders, including myocardial infarction. The data from clinical trials suggest that these adverse reactions have been observed, but specific rates for AMI during the trials are not detailed. No further evidence from case studies or detailed post-marketing surveillance outcomes regarding AMI specifically related to ixabepilone use are mentioned in the provided label sections.

It's important to note that the data presented here are summarizations of label warnings and findings from the indicated sources. For a comprehensive risk assessment or decision-making regarding use of ixabepilone in a clinical context, it's crucial to consider the full prescribing information, additional studies, or case reports that might provide further insights into the incidence and risk factors for such adverse reactions.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ketoprofen,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ketoprofen, the evidence does indicate a causal relationship between ketoprofen, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and adverse cardiovascular events. However, the specific evidence for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction of ketoprofen is not extensively detailed within these sections.

The sections of the label under ""Incidence Less Than 1% (Causal Relationship Unknown)"" mention myocardial infarction as a rare adverse reaction, but it states that the causal relationship to ketoprofen is uncertain. This implies that while there have been reports of myocardial infarction in patients taking ketoprofen, there is no definitive evidence establishing a direct cause-and-effect relationship based solely on these isolated reports.

It is also worth noting that the ""Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events"" section highlights that NSAIDs as a class are associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, which include myocardial infarction and stroke. This increased risk is mentioned to occur early in treatment and may increase with the duration of use. The label also includes a contraindication for using ketoprofen in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to this increased risk, providing further evidence that cardiovascular risks are associated with NSAID use in general.

To summarize, while the drug label indicates that there is an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events with NSAID use, including myocardial infarction, and mentions myocardial infarction in the less than 1% incidence category for ketoprofen, it does not provide a clear and precise causational link specifically for AMI as an adverse reaction to ketoprofen. More detailed investigations, such as large-scale clinical trials, observational studies, or meta-analyses evaluating the cardiovascular safety of ketoprofen, would be needed to conclusively establish such a relationship. As of the evidence available in the provided drug label, a definitive causal association between ketoprofen and acute myocardial infarction remains uncertain. 

For a thorough assessment, one would need to review additional sources such as more recent clinical studies, case reports, and other drug surveillance data. If new findings have become available after the knowledge cutoff date of this model, they would not be included in this summary.","NA

The information provided in the drug label indicates that myocardial infarction (heart attack) is listed under ""Incidence Less Than 1% (Causal Relationship Unknown)"" for adverse reactions whose causal relationship to ketoprofen is uncertain. It implies that while myocardial infarction has been reported, there is no clear evidence to refute or establish that acute myocardial infarction is a direct adverse reaction of ketoprofen. Moreover, the label also states that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include ketoprofen, carry an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly with prolonged use.

Given this information, it is not possible to provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and ketoprofen exposure because myocardial infarction is indeed recognized as a potential albeit rare and uncertainly linked adverse event in the context of ketoprofen use."
acute myocardial infarction,ketorolac,1.0,"Based on the information provided from the sections of the drug label concerning adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, it is evident that ketorolac tromethamine, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has an increased risk of causing serious cardiovascular thrombotic events. These events include myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with the duration of use. This is explicitly stated in the ""CARDIOVASCULAR THOMBOTIC EVENTS"" section of the drug label.

Furthermore, in the postmarketing surveillance section, it is mentioned that myocardial infarction is one of the adverse reactions that have been observed in patients taking ketorolac tromethamine, along with other NSAIDs. This data is derived from reported postmarketing experiences, which typically involve a broader patient population in a less controlled setting compared to clinical trials. Such reports are valuable for identifying rare but serious adverse effects that may not be detected in premarketing studies.

To summarize, evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and exposure to ketorolac tromethamine includes:

1. The drug label warning that ketorolac tromethamine can increase the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
2. Postmarketing surveillance reports that have documented myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction in patients taking ketorolac tromethamine.

Given these specific references, there is a clear indication that the risk of acute myocardial infarction should be considered a potential adverse reaction of ketorolac tromethamine usage. However, the evidence does not quantify the incidence or provide detailed circumstances under which the myocardial infarctions occurred, which could affect the assessment of causality.

Healthcare providers should be aware of this risk when prescribing ketorolac tromethainme and monitor patients accordingly, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. When making medication decisions, it is essential to weigh the benefits against these serious potential risks.","NA

The drug label you provided lists myocardial infarction as one of the adverse reactions observed in patients taking ketorolac tromethamine. Since the adverse reaction is included in the label, which is based on evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, or other studies conducted during the drug approval process, refuting evidence is not applicable here. Consequently, it is not possible to provide evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and ketorolac exposure based on this information."
acute myocardial infarction,lansoprazole,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for lansoprazole, there is mention of numerous adverse reactions and clinical considerations. However, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, is not explicitly listed as a routinely expected adverse reaction for lansoprazole in these sections.

From the details of adverse reactions seen in clinical trials and post-marketing experience, cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction are listed among the less common side effects that have been reported. Specifically, it is categorized under ""Cardiovascular System"" in the adverse experiences occurring in less than 1% of patients or subjects who received lansoprazole in domestic trials.

It is important to recognize that while myocardial infarction is mentioned, the labeling does not establish a definitive causative relationship between lansoprazole use and the occurrence of myocardial infarction. This inclusion in the drug label may be due to legal and regulatory requirements to report any potential adverse event observed during drug studies, even if the relationship to the medication is not clear.

Therefore, based on the available labeling information provided, although myocardial infarction has been reported as an observed adverse effect in less than 1% of patients, there is no strong evidence provided to suggest a direct causal relationship between lansoprazole exposure and acute myocardial infarction. If a more detailed and rigorous assessment of all available scientific and medical data is required, including a search of the most recent medical literature and clinical trial databases, further research and consultation would be necessary to determine if more substantial evidence exists.","Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and postmarketing experience related to lansoprazole, there is no direct evidence presented to suggest that acute myocardial infarfection (AMI) is a recognized adverse reaction of lansoprazole. Myocardial infarction (MI) is listed among cardiovascular system adverse events occurring in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to the drug is not established. Additionally, while cardiovascular adverse events including myocardial infarction are mentioned, the context does not imply a refutation of the relationship but rather an acknowledgment of reported events without establishing causation.

It's important to consider that lack of evidence of an association in the labeling does not conclusively prove the absence of a relationship, as postmarketing experiences, especially those voluntarily reported, may not capture all incidences or establish clear causal links. Furthermore, in the absence of specific clinical trial data refuting the relationship between lansoprazole and AMI, it can only be stated that AMI is not identified as a common adverse reaction in the available labeling information, but this does not serve as definitive evidence to refute the relationship.

In summary, the evidence provided does not include data explicitly refuting the association between lansoprazole and acute myocardial infarction, but myocardial infarction is not recognized as a common or well-established adverse reaction to lansoprazole in the materials provided."
acute myocardial infarction,lenalidomide,,"The drug label provided for lenalidomide, also known by its trade name Revlimid, includes extensive information regarding adverse reactions and warnings, which is critical in evaluating the relationship between drug exposure and potential adverse events. 

Upon review of the provided label sections, specifically the cardiac disorders subsection under ""Clinical Trials Experience"" for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) receiving lenalidomide in combination with other treatments, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported. While the rates were explicitly stated as being ""less than 5%"" in patients treated with the Rd Continuous and Rd18 arms (two different treatment schedules of lenalidomide with dexamethasone), each had incidences of acute myocardial infarction reported as serious or severe adverse reactions. This is an indication that there is evidence of myocardial infarction occurring in patients treated with lenalidomide, at least within the confines of the clinical trials.

For postmarketing experience, although several adverse drug reactions were identified, myocardial infarction was explicitly mentioned under the cardiac disorders as one of the reactions observed. This again substantiates a relationship between myocardial infarction and lenalidomide use, as these reports come from the real-world setting following the drug’s approval.

The Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions sections do not explicitly state acute myocardial infarction as a recognized adverse reaction. However, they do mention the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism, which relates indirectly to cardiac risks as it includes the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients taking lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma treatment.

In summary, there is evidence, particularly from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and lenalidomide treatment. However, quantification of this risk is not provided, and the evidence does not clearly establish the incidence rate or the mechanism by which lenalidomide might contribute to this adverse reaction. These risks must be balanced against the therapeutic benefits of lenalidomide and are managed through careful patient monitoring and risk mitigation strategies, as laid out in the drug's REMS program.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,letrozole,,"The provided label information outlines various adverse reactions associated with letrozole, a medication primarily used as an adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Letrozole acts by inhibiting aromatase, leading to decreased levels of circulating estrogens.

**Evidence of Adverse Reaction: Acute Myocardial Infarction**

The relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and letrozole can be found within the ""Adverse Reactions"" and ""Clinical Trials Experience"" sections of the label:

1. **Clinical Trials Evidence:**
   In the BIG 1-98 study, a median treatment duration of 60 months and a median follow-up duration of 96 months was reported. Within this trial, myocardial infarction was reported in letrozole-treated patients (1.0%) as compared to tamoxifen-treated patients (0.5%). Similarly, the incidence of other cardiovascular conditions like ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents, and angina requiring surgery was also measured. It should be noted that these reactions were irrespective of the relationship to the study treatment.

2. **Post-Marketing Experience:**
   Beyond clinical trials, additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of letrozole. Although myocardial infarction is not explicitly listed under the postmarketing experience, the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section indicates that this is not an exhaustive list due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the variability of the population size.

**Summary:**

There is evidence from clinical trial data (BIG 1-98 study) to suggest a potential relationship between letrozole use and an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction, showing a 1.0% incidence in letrozole-treated patients versus 0.5% in tamoxifen-treated patients. This data provides a signal toward a potential increase in risk for AMI in patients treated with letrozole, especially when compared to an alternative therapy such as tamoxifen. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously, as the adverse reactions were reported without specifying a direct causal relationship to the treatment.

Other cardiovascular adverse events were also observed in the trials, but there is no detailed postmarketing data specifically for AMI, likely due to underreporting or lack of attribution directly to the drug. No statements have been made about the grading or confirmation of myocardial infarction severity in this context.

**Sources:**

The primary source of evidence comes from the cited BIG 1-98 study's findings, which are outlined in the drug label provided. Clinical Trials Experience sections and tables therein list the observed adverse reactions, including the incidence of myocardial infarction. The ""Postmarketing Experience"" section informs about adverse reactions identified after the approval of letrozole.","Based on the information provided from the clinical trial experiences and other sections of the drug label for letrozole, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was observed in some patients treated with letrozole. In the adjuvant study provided, myocardial infarction was reported in 1.0% of patients receiving letrozole as opposed to 0.5% of patients treated with tamoxifen. It's important to note that this adverse event was tracked along with others as part of the study's safety and tolerability assessments. However, this does not necessarily refute the relationship between AMI and letrozole, as the data does show a comparative incidence, albeit low, associated with its use.

Refuting the relationship would require evidence showing no increase in the risk of AMI with letrozole use compared to controls or an alternative treatment. Such evidence is not provided directly in the information given. Thus, we cannot definitively say based on this data alone that there is no relationship between AMI and letrozole; instead, it provides a comparative incidence rate in the context of a clinical trial with tamoxifen.

In summary, the drug label indicates a 1.0% incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with letrozole in one of the studies, compared to a 0.5% incidence in the tamoxifen control group. This data does not refute a potential relationship between AMI and letrozole but rather demonstrates a numerical difference in incidence between the drug and a comparison group within the specific study parameters.

NA

For a thorough evaluation, a comprehensive review of the literature, including case reports, observational studies, and further controlled trials, would be required to provide evidence that might refute the link between AMI and letrozole."
acute myocardial infarction,leuprolide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of leuprolide, which is marketed as ELIGARD, can be derived from the Warnings and Precautions (5.4) section of the drug's label.

The label for ELIGARD includes a specific cardiovascular warning that states there is an increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke in men treated with GnRH agonists, a category of drugs that includes leuprolide. While the risk appears to be low based on reported odds ratios, it is significant enough to warrant inclusion in the label and for health care providers to monitor symptoms and signs suggestive of cardiovascular disease in patients treated with these agents.

Clinical Trials:
No specific details are provided in the sections provided regarding clinical trials that focus on the incidence of AMI directly. The provided sections detail the most common adverse reactions and monitored laboratory parameters but do not explicitly report data on AMI.

Case Studies:
The drug label does not provide any reference to case studies explicitly linking leuprolide use to AMI. Therefore, based on the information provided, there does not appear to be individual case studies detailed within the clinical trial experience (6.1).

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The post-marketing surveillance, as indicated in section 6.2, reports an increased risk of developing myocardial infarction (among other cardiovascular diseases), which has been identified during the post-approval use of ELIGARD. However, exact frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure is difficult to establish due to the voluntary nature of post-marketing reports and the unknown size of the exposed population.

In summary, the drug label for ELIGARD notes an increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke based on post-marketing experiences, mandating careful patient monitoring (5.4 Cardiovascular Diseases). There is no direct evidence from clinical trials or case studies provided in the sections of the label that detail the frequency or causality of AMI due to leuprolide use; the information provided is based on post-marketing reports which suggest an association but do not confirm causality.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,levothyroxine,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, acute myocardial infarction is listed as a potential adverse reaction to levothyroxine sodium therapy. This association appears to be related to therapeutic overdosage, leading to symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The sections describe that cardiovascular adverse reactions—specifically palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest—can manifest as a result of excess levothyroxine.

Clinical trials often pre-screen participants for risk factors that would predispose them to adverse events like acute myocardial infarction, which can limit the evidence gathered during trials related to the frequency of such events. Similarly, post-marketing surveillance provides additional data that can help ascertain the risks associated with a drug once it is widely used by the general population. Given that these data sources are not explicitly detailed here, we would need to review published clinical trial results, epidemiological studies, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence.

Moreover, caution is advised in the use of levothyroxine in elderly patients and those with underlying cardiovascular disease due to the risk of cardiac symptoms. Lower initial doses of levothyroxine are recommended in these populations to prevent adverse cardiac events.

It is important to note that while the drug label acknowledges the occurrence of myocardial infarction, it does not provide specific data on the incidence or the direct causal relationship. Such information would be derived from additional sources including independent clinical studies and reports lodged with health authorities following product release into the market, such as those submitted to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

To conclude, according to the drug label, acute myocardial infarction is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to levothyroxine, primarily through mechanisms related to overdose and resulting hyperthyroidism. Specific evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance has not been provided here. Healthcare providers should closely monitor patients on levothyroxine for cardiovascular signs and symptoms and titrate the dose carefully to avoid overdose and subsequent adverse effects.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,liothyronine,,"Based on the information provided from the sections of the drug label (adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings) of liothyronine, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as one of the potential adverse reactions of liothyronine therapy, particularly as a result of therapeutic overdosage which leads to hyperthyroidism.

The warning sections elaborate on the cardiac risks associated with liothyronine sodium. It emphasizes the need for cautious dosing in the elderly and individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease because of the heightened risk of cardiac adverse reactions such as atrial fibrillation. Myocardial infarction specifically is mentioned as a potential adverse event within the array of possible cardiovascular responses that also include angina, elevated heart rate, and arrhythmias. Overtreatment with liothyronine can lead to increased heart rate and cardiac wall thickness, which can precipitate these events.

There is a strong implication of a dose-response relationship, as both the occurrence of general hyperthyroid symptoms and specific cardiac adverse reactions like myocardial infarction are linked to therapeutic overdosage (i.e., doses exceeding daily hormonal requirements). The label also warns against the use of liothyronine for the treatment of obesity or weight loss since larger doses can cause toxicity, and the cardiovascular effects, including the acute myocardial infarction, are a component of such toxic reactions.

Clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance as individual sources of evidence are not detailed within the provided text, hence it is assumed that the mention of myocardial infarction in the labeling is based on a combination of pre-approval clinical trial data, postmarketing experiences (which can include individual case reports as well as wider surveillance of the medication in the general population), and the pharmacological effects of the drug when administered in high doses leading to hyperthyroidism.

However, no specific quantitative data or detailed outcomes from specific studies or reports are provided in the label excerpt. For a thorough assessment of the evidence, consultation of clinical trial data, published case reports, and post-marketing surveillance studies would be necessary to provide detailed context and incidence rates of myocardial infarction related to liothyronine use.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,lisdexamfetamine,,"To summarize the evidence of the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exposure to lisdexamfetamine, a review of the provided label sections for adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience was performed. Here are the findings:

**Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):**
In clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, conducted under varying conditions and compared with a placebo, the most common adverse reactions reported were related to psychiatric symptoms, growth suppression, and cardiovascular effects such as increased blood pressure and heart rate. Specifically, cardiovascular-related adverse reactions in pediatric and adult populations included instances of ECG voltage criteria for ventricular hypertrophy, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, and increased heart rate. However, there was no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction among the listed adverse reactions.

**Warnings and Precautions (5.2 and 5.3):**
The label warns against the use of lisdexamfetamine in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac diseases. It is suggested that sudden death has been reported in such patients when treated with CNS stimulants at recommended ADHD dosages. Additionally, lisdexamfetamine is known to cause increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which could imply a potential risk for cardiac events such as AMI, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions.

**Postmarketing Experience (6.2):**
The postmarketing experience has included reports of cardiomyopathy, but acute myocardial infarction is not specified. It is important to note that because these reactions are reported voluntarily and the population size is uncertain, it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these events or establish a cause-and-effect relationship with lisdexamfetamine exposure.

Based on the information provided from the drug label, while there are cardiovascular risks associated with the use of lisdexamfetamine, including an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as contraindications for use in patients with significant cardiac disease, there is no specific evidence listed in the clinical trial data, warnings, or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking lisdexamfetamine with acute myocardial infarction. Thus, while a relationship may be theoretically possible, especially in vulnerable populations, the available evidence does not conclusively support a direct association between lisdexamfetamine use and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. It is critical for healthcare providers to assess individual patient risk and monitor cardiovascular status when prescribing lisdexamfetamine.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,lisinopril,,"Based on the information provided, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself is not listed as an adverse reaction to lisinopril in the drug label sections you have furnished. However, certain adverse reactions associated with the treatment of AMI using lisinopril are detailed.

In patients who had undergone treatment with lisinopril following acute myocardial infarction, there was a higher incidence of hypotension (5.3% increase) and renal dysfunction (1.3% increase compared with patients not taking lisinopril, as seen in the GISSI-3 trial). The renal dysfunction noted in the trial involved an increase in creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling, or more, of the baseline serum creatinine concentration. However, it is important to note that this evidence does not directly link lisinopril as the causative agent for AMI, but rather these are complications or adverse reactions observed in the context of AMI treatment with lisinopril.

Elsewhere in the label, under section 5.4 Hypotension, it is mentioned that patients should avoid use of lisinopril who are hemodynamically unstable after acute MI, indicating a concern for potential adverse hemodynamic responses after such an event, but again this does not suggest that lisinopril is a cause of AMI itself.

In summary, while the drug label mentions adverse reactions like hypotension and renal dysfunction associated with the use of lisinopril in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, it does not explicitly list AMI as a known adverse reaction to lisinopril. Thus, there is no direct evidence from the provided sections of the drug label that lisinopril causes acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. Any further evaluation would require a thorough review of clinical data and case studies outside the provided label information. 

For a comprehensive risk assessment, healthcare professionals typically rely on broader clinical data, individual patient factors, and post-marketing surveillance reports. It's important when assessing causality to have access to a larger evidence base including clinical trials data, observational studies, and case reports, which are not provided in your request.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,lorlatinib,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for lorlatinib (LORBRENA), evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure can be summarized as follows:

In the clinical trial experience section (6.1) of the drug label, it is documented that fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The label specifically mentions myocardial infarction (0.7%) as one of the fatal adverse reactions, indicating that in the context of this clinical trial, a small percentage of patients experienced AMI which was considered to be related to the exposure of lorlatinib.

Relevant details regarding clinical trials include:
- The safety population described comes from two studies (Study B7461001 and Study B7461006) including 476 patients who received 100 mg of LORBRENA once daily.
- AMI is specifically mentioned under the section summarizing safety data from patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who were treated in Study B7461001, providing evidence that the event was observed during treatment with lorlatinib.
- The median duration of exposure to LORBRENA in the study mentioned was 12.5 months, with 52% of patients receiving the drug for a year or longer.

In terms of post-marketing surveillance, the label urges reporting of suspected adverse reactions to Pfizer Inc. or the FDA but does not detail specific post-marketing data related to AMI.

In conclusion, clinical trial evidence from the provided drug label sections suggests there is a potential relationship between lorlatinib exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, with a reported incidence of 0.7% of patients experiencing this serious adverse reaction. However, comprehensive data from broader post-marketing surveillance are not provided, and thus the overall incidence in a larger, real-world population cannot be completely assessed from this summary alone. It is important to consider that adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials may not reflect rates in the general population due to the controlled environment and specific patient populations of clinical trials.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,losartan,,"The evidence from the drug label provided does not indicate that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a recognized adverse reaction to losartan based on clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. Within the sections pertaining to adverse reactions (6.1) and postmarketing experience (6.2), and throughout the warnings and box warnings of the label, there is no mention of AMI as a direct adverse event related to the use of losartan.

In the clinical trials section (6.1), common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) reported in hypertensive patients treated with losartan included dizziness, upper respiratory infection, nasal congestion, and back pain. Other, less common reactions included various systemic effects, such as anemia, depression, somnolence, and headache, but not AMI.

Furthermore, in the postmarketing experience section (6.2), while various additional adverse reactions such as hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, angioedema, and rhabdomyolysis are reported, AMI is not mentioned.

The warnings and box warnings predominantly address the risk of fetal toxicity (when the drug is used in pregnancy) and the management of hypotension, renal function deterioration, and hyperkalemia, without any direct reference to AMI as an adverse effect.

If there were a known relationship between losartan and AMI, we would expect to see it listed explicitly as an adverse reaction or in the warnings. Since it is not included in these sections, there is no evidence provided in the drug label to support a relationship between the potential adverse reaction of AMI and exposure to losartan.

For a definitive conclusion, one would need to consult the full spectrum of clinical data and published literature, which may include epidemiological studies, additional clinical trial data, or mechanistic studies that explore the safety profile of losartan. In the absence of such data within the drug label, one cannot establish a causal link between losartan and acute myocardial infarction on the basis of the provided information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,"lymphocyte immune globulin, anti-thymocyte globulin",,"After a thorough review of the provided label sections for lymphocyte immune globulin, anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin), there does not appear to be a direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials detailed in section 6.1 or the post-marketing experience in section 6.2. AMI is an event where blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, leading to potential damage to the heart muscle. It is commonly known as a heart attack.

The adverse reactions listed in the drug label primarily include various infections, hematologic abnormalities, and other immune system disorders. Specifically, common adverse reactions include urinary tract infections, fever, hypertension, nausea, and hematologic abnormalities such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

However, infusion-associated reactions (IARs) are mentioned in the label and include a list of symptoms such as fever, chills, dyspnea, hypertension, and others, which are consistent with an infusion reaction that could potentially include cardiovascular effects. Additionally, in the postmarketing experience detailed in 6.2, there is a mention of IARs with Thymoglobulin that can manifest with cardiovascular dysfunction, which includes myocardial infarction (heart attack). This suggests that while AMI may not be a common or well-characterized adverse reaction to Thymoglobulin, there have been instances postmarketing where such an event has occurred in association with drug infusion.

In conclusion, while the clinical trial data and the adverse reactions reported do not establish a frequent or direct relationship between Thymoglobulin administration and AMI, the post-marketing surveillance has identified isolated cases of myocardial infarction as part of severe infusion-associated reactions. Due to the nature of voluntary reporting in the post-marketing phase, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a strong causal relationship to Thymoglobulin exposure. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor patients for signs of cardiovascular dysfunction during and after the administration of this medication, and to report suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,maraviroc,,"The sections provided from the drug label discuss a range of adverse reactions and other warnings related to maraviroc (brand name SELZENTRY), which is an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV-1 infection. Maraviroc functions as a CCR5 co-receptor antagonist. 

While the label provides detailed information about various adverse events and the general safety profile of maraviroc, it does not specifically list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction. However, under the ""Cardiovascular Events"" heading within the ""Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects"" and ""Warnings and Precautions"" sections, there is an association between cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, and the use of maraviroc:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
- It is reported that 1.3% of the subjects (11 subjects) who received maraviroc during Phase 3 trials experienced cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, with a total exposure of 609 patient-years. These subjects had cardiac disease or risk factors prior to using the drug.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- The drug label does not provide specific data on post-marketing surveillance regarding myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to maraviroc.

The absence of a clearly defined causal relationship in these cardiovascular events and the presence of pre-existing cardiac conditions in affected individuals make it challenging to establish a direct link between maraviroc exposure and AMI. However, given that myocardial infarction is mentioned under the banner of cardiovascular events, there is evidence that suggests at least a potential association that warrants further monitoring and investigation, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac risk factors.

Moreover, any potential relationship between maraviroc and acute myocardial infarction is complex due to the involvement of multiple factors, including patient comorbidities, prior cardiac history, and the presence of other medications that might contribute to cardiovascular risk.

In summary, there is some evidence from clinical trials indicating a higher instance of cardiovascular events, which include myocardial infarction, in individuals treated with maraviroc compared to placebo. However, a direct causal relationship is not firmly established, and pre-existing conditions may be influential. Further investigation and vigilance in monitoring are advised, particularly in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,medroxyprogesterone,,"The relationship between acute myocardial infarction (MI) and medroxyprogesterone (MPA) exposure is supported by findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, as detailed in the drug label provided. The WHI was a large-scale, randomized controlled trial exploring the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. A specific substudy involving estrogen plus progestin therapy with conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate highlighted an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

According to the drug label information, the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke, and myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who were treated with a combination of daily oral conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) compared to those taking a placebo.

It is important to note that this evidence specifically concerns the combination of estrogen and progestin therapy and not medroxyprogesterone alone. However, the inclusion of myocardial infarction in the cardiovascular section of both the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" and ""WARNINGS"" within the drug label implies a recognized association with the combined hormone therapy that includes medroxyprogesterone. Given the nature of this combined therapy, it is not possible to isolate the effects of medroxyprogesterone alone conclusively.

Furthermore, the drug label emphasizes that such risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate and potentially for other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.

In conclusion, the evidence from the WHI's clinical study implies an association between the combination of estrogen and medroxyprogesterone therapy with an increased risk of myocardial infarction among postmenopausal women. This evidence is specifically for the combination therapy rather than medroxyprogesterone alone. There is no explicit evidence mentioned on the label indicating that medroxyprogesterone alone directly causes acute myocardial infarction. Healthcare providers are advised to prescribe hormone therapies at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration appropriate for the treatment goals and risks for each individual.","The evidence provided does not support a claim that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not an adverse reaction of medroxyprogesterone when used alone. However, the drug label does indicate that in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was an increased risk of myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) treated with a combination of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg] and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], compared to placebo.

The label warns against the use of combined estrogen plus progestin therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease due to the increased risks identified, including myocardial infarction. The evidence from the WHI substudy is specific to the combination of CE and MPA, and while it is associated with an increased risk of AMI, it does not provide direct evidence regarding AMI risk with medroxyprogesterone alone.

Therefore, based on the information supplied, there is no substantial evidence provided that directly refutes the relationship between medroxyprogesterone use alone and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. The absence of direct evidence does not conclusively indicate that such a relationship does not exist, only that it hasn't been substantiated by the information available in this context. It is important to consult further clinical data or studies specifically investigating medroxyprogesterone alone without concomitant estrogens to draw a more definitive conclusion regarding its relationship to AMI."
acute myocardial infarction,mefenamate,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a type of serious cardiovascular event, has indeed been identified as a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of mefenamic acid, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Evidence for the association between mefenamic acid use and the risk of severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, primarily comes from warnings that reflect an established understanding of NSAIDs' mechanism of action and their effects on cardiovascular health. Such understanding is supported by data from broader clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance of NSAIDs as a drug class, rather than solely on mefenamic acid.

The label specifies that NSAIDs cause an ""increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal."" It also indicates that this risk may occur early in the course of treatment and may increase with the duration of use. While this is a general characteristic of many NSAIDs, specific incidence rates or evidence from clinical trials on mefenamic acid and AMI were not given in the label excerpt provided.

In the ""Warnings"" section, the drug label recommends caution due to the risk of serious cardiovascular events and states that mefenamic acid is contraindicated after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, highlighting concerns around the cardiovascular impact of the drug.

Additionally, the ""Other adverse reactions"" section of the label lists myocardial infarction as a rare adverse event, acknowledging that although uncommon, heart attacks have been reported in patients who take the drug.

In summary, the drug label for mefenamic acid indicates an increased risk of myocardial infarction as a potential adverse reaction, a warning that is consistent with the recognized cardiovascular risk profile of NSAIDs as a class. However, specific quantitative evidence or studies focusing on mefenamic acid alone was not detailed in the information provided. Without access to separate clinical trial data, case reports, or articles from medical journals and databases published after the cutoff knowledge date, this summary can only confirm that the relationship between mefenamic acid and AMI is acknowledged in the drug’s labeling based on the established cardiovascular risks of NSAIDs.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,meloxicam,,"The evidence regarding meloxicam and the potential risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction primarily stems from the underlying pharmacological class of meloxicam — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Meloxicam, like other NSAIDs, carries a boxed warning indicating an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, which includes myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly with longer use or in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disorders. This information is grounded in the scientific literature, regulatory agency warnings, and product labeling.

**Clinical Trials and Observational Studies:**
Clinical trials involving other NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, have demonstrated an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events. This risk appears to emerge early in the course of treatment. For instance, the VIGOR (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research) study, which examined the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib, revealed higher rates of cardiovascular events compared to naproxen. Although such data pertain to a different NSAID, they contribute to the overall understanding of CV risk across this class of drugs.

**Postmarketing Surveillance:**
The drug label for meloxicam mentions that adverse reactions reported during postmarketing experience are based on voluntary reports and that it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the uncontrolled nature of these reports. However, postmarketing surveillance throughout the years has added to the understanding of the relationship between NSAIDs and increased cardiovascular risks, but direct statistical data specific to meloxicam-induced myocardial infarction from this data set is not provided.

**Boxed Warnings:**
As highlighted in the boxed warnings for meloxicam:

1. NSAIDs, including meloxicam, have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, particularly with prolonged use.
2. Patients with recent myocardial infarction are generally advised to avoid using meloxicam due to the risk of recurrent cardiovascular thrombotic events, unless the benefits are deemed to outweigh the risks.
3. Adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction have been mentioned but are not quantified.

**Mechanism of Action:**
The mechanism behind the increased risk of AMI with NSAID use, including meloxic

    am, relates to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), which can lead to cardiovascular effects including increased blood pressure and formation of blood clots, as well as other mechanisms that may influence cardiovascular health.

In conclusion, while the meloxicam product labeling, informed by clinical trials, observational studies, and postmarketing surveillance, does not provide quantified incidence rates of myocardial infarction specific to meloxicam, it does contain a clear warning of the risk of serious CV thrombotic events. This reflects a class effect of NSAIDs based on an aggregate of scientific data, including studies on drugs with similar mechanisms of action. Health care providers are advised to consider the potential CV risks of meloxicam, especially in patients with existing CV disease or risk factors, and to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to mitigate these risks.","The provided drug label sections indicate that meloxicam, like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), carries a risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. These risks may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use, as mentioned in the Boxed Warning and under Warnings and Precautions (5.1). The label also notes that the use of meloxicam is contraindicated in the setting of a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events post-surgery.

Additional information specifically pertaining to post-myocardial infarction patients is provided, indicating that NSAID use in the post-MI period is associated with an increased risk of reinfarction, cardiovascular-related death, and all-cause mortality starting from the first week of treatment, based on observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry.

The evidence, therefore, does not refute the relationship between meloxicam exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction. On the contrary, the label explicitly warns of the risk of MI associated with meloxicam usage, particularly in patients who have had a recent MI or who have existing cardiovascular risk factors.

In summary, there is no evidence provided in the sections of the drug label to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and meloxicam exposure. The evidence available supports the inclusion of MI as a potential serious adverse cardiovascular event that may be associated with meloxicam use. Consequently, the response to the request for evidence refuting the relationship is 'NA', as the adverse reaction is related to the drug per the drug's boxed warning and precautions."
acute myocardial infarction,memantine,,"Based on the provided information from the drug label of memantine, including sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience, there is no direct evidence listed that associates acute myocardial infarction with the use of memantine. Acute myocardial infarction is not mentioned as a common adverse reaction, nor is it included in the list of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.

The most common adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials for memantine (incidence ≥ 5% and higher than placebo) were dizziness, headache, confusion, and constipation. Cardiovascular-related adverse reactions documented included hypertension and cardiac failure congestive, but these are distinct conditions and do not equate to an acute myocardial infarction.

Additionally, post-marketing experience mentioned other adverse reactions that were reported voluntarily and included some cardiac disorders, such as cardiac failure congestive. However, acute myocardial infarction was not specified among the list of post-marketing adverse reactions.

Therefore, based on the information provided from the drug label and without additional data from other clinical studies, case reports, or expanded post-marketing surveillance, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the administration of memantine. 

Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions associated with drug therapy to the relevant authorities, such as the FDA, which can help in identifying and documenting rare or long-term adverse effects not detected in initial clinical trials. If new evidence emerges that indicates a potential relationship between memartial exposure and acute myocardial infarction, it would require an update to the drug label and potentially additional clinical investigation to assess causality.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for memantine, there are no direct mentions of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction in the context of clinical trials (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) or in the postmarketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience). Specific adverse reactions listed within these sections do not include AMI, and it was not documented as a cause for treatment discontinuation. Additionally, the drug label does not include AMI within warning sections or precautions that might suggest a known association.

Given that AMI is not listed as an adverse reaction in both the clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance for memarine and no explicit association is made in the drug label sections provided, it can be inferred that there is presently no evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is an adverse reaction of memantine.

It is important to note that a lack of evidence is not definitive proof that there is no relationship between memantine and AMI; adverse drug reactions can be underreported or only become apparent after long-term use or in population subgroups not adequately studied in clinical trials. Therefore, while acute myocardial infarction is not identified as an adverse reaction of memantine based on the current label information, ongoing surveillance and reporting are crucial for the continued evaluation of a drug's safety profile."
acute myocardial infarction,meropenem,,"Based on the verbiage from the adverse reactions section of the drug label for meropenem, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned as an observed adverse event. Under the ""Systemic Adverse Reactions,"" AMI is listed within the cardiovascular adverse events reported, although it appears to be a rare occurrence based on the available data. The information implies that it was reported with a frequency of less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of the treated patients.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The label does not provide explicit details on the specific number of AMI cases reported during the clinical trials or their direct causality with meropenem use. It indicates that adverse reaction frequencies were derived from clinical trials involving 2904 immunocompetent adult patients treated for non-CNS infections. It also acknowledges that many of the trial participants were severely ill, with multiple diseases and receiving various drug therapies, which complicates the determination of the exact relationship between meropenem therapy and observed adverse events, including AMI.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
As for post-marketing surveillance, there is no specific mention of AMI in this context within the provided text. Post-marketing adverse reactions usually offer broader insights since they capture a more diverse patient population over a longer period compared to clinical trials.

It should be noted that during post-marketing experience, various adverse reactions not mentioned in the clinical trials section have been reported, which are of uncertain frequency due to voluntary reporting and undetermined population size.

Given the provided drug label information, it can be concluded that there is some evidence of AMI being a potential adverse reaction to meropenem, as observed in less than or equal to 1% of clinical trial patients. However, the exact causality between meropenem and AMI cannot be firmly established due to the complexity of patient conditions and concomitant therapies. Additional studies, if existent, may provide more data on this relationship but are not detailed within the drug label information provided. It is important for healthcare providers to consider the possibility of AMassage, but also weigh it against the patient's overall health condition and other risk factors for AMI they might have.","The drug label information provided discusses various adverse reactions associated with meropenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic typically used for the treatment of severe bacterial infections. Among the adverse reactions listed, myocardial infarction (heart attack) is noted under the cardiovascular adverse events section. However, the context of the incidence is not fully detailed.

The label information does indicate myocardial infarction as an adverse event occurring in less than or equal to 1.0% but greater than 0.1% of adult patients in clinical trials. It's important to state that this information does not necessarily refute the relationship between meropenem and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction; rather, it identifies that myocardial infarction has been reported as an adverse event. However, the causal relationship is not clearly established within this data.

The mention of myocardial infarction in the drug label suggests that there have been cases observed in relation to meropenem use, although the frequency is relatively low. It should be considered that many patients treated with meropenem in clinical trials were severely ill with multiple underlying conditions and concurrent medications, which may confound the ability to definitively attribute myocardial infarction directly to meropenem.

In conclusion, the provided label information indicates that myocardial infarction has been reported as an adverse event but does not necessarily provide a clear refutation of the relationship between meropenem exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction. Given the complex nature of patients' health status in the cited studies, definitive evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and meropenem is not clearly stated in this labeling. Further investigation and post-marketing surveillance data would be necessary to establish a more causal relationship."
acute myocardial infarction,methylnaltrexone,,"Based on the provided drug label information for methylnaltrexone (brand name RELISTOR), there is mention of cardiovascular incidents in the section discussing post-marketing experience. The drug label notes that during a 48-week, open-label, uncontrolled trial (Study 3) involving 1034 adult patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and chronic non-cancer pain, there were reported cardiovascular events including myocardial infarctions—with one resulting in death—along with a stroke leading to death, a fatal cardiac arrest, and one sudden death. However, it is explicitly stated that ""It is not possible to establish a relationship between these events and RELISTOR.""

Adverse reactions stated in RELISTOR clinical trials and post-marketing experience mainly highlight gastrointestinal issues like abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, as well as symptoms that could represent opioid withdrawal, such as hyperhidrosis, chills, and anxiety. Serious adverse reactions described elsewhere in the labeling include gastrointestinal perforation, severe or persistent diarrhea, and opioid withdrawal.

Based on the wisdom of the label, there is currently no established evidence that directly links acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to methylnaltrexone exposure. The cardiovascular issues observed were in the context of a post-marketing study with no established causal relationship. Clinical trials focused on the safety and efficacy of methylnaltrexone for treating OIC did not report acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction. Therefore, while cardiovascular incidents were reported, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that acute myocardial infarction is a known adverse reaction to methylnaltrexone. Hence, healthcare providers should continue to monitor patients for any severe side effects and report them accordingly to contribute to a better understanding of the drug's safety profile.

Source: The product labeling provided which includes adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections for the drug methylnaltrexone (RELISTOR).",NA
acute myocardial infarction,methylnaltrexone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for methylnaltrexone (RELISTOR), the evidence does not explicitly establish a causal relationship between methylnaltrexone exposure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a potential adverse reaction. The summarized data from clinical trials (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3) and post-marketing surveillance do not list AMI as a common adverse reaction.

In Study 3, which was a 48-week, open-label, uncontrolled trial involving 1034 adult patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and chronic non-cancer pain, there were reports of 4 myocardial infarctions (1 fatal), 1 fatal stroke, 1 fatal cardiac arrest, and 1 sudden death among the participants. However, the drug label explicitly states ""It is not possible to establish a relationship between these events and RELISTOR."" This indicates that while myocardial infarctions were observed during the study, a direct link between the medication and the occurrence of these cardiovascular events has not been established.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with methylnaltrexone are generally gastrointestinal in nature (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea), and some reactions may reflect symptoms of opioid withdrawal (e.g., hyperhidrosis, chills, anxiety). No cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction are noted among these reactions in the clinical trials described in the label.

The post-marketing experience section lists adverse reactions identified during the use of RELISTOR after approval, which include gastrointestinal perforation, cramping, and vomiting, along with general disorders like diaphoresis, flushing, malaise, and pain. Cases of opioid withdrawal have also been reported. However, acute myocardial infarction is not mentioned in this post-marketing data either.

In summary, there is no evidence provided in the drug label that directly supports a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to methylnaltrexone. The observed instances of AMI in a clinical trial cannot be definitively linked to the drug based on the available information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,methylphenidate,,"Based on the extensive drug label information provided, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse reaction to methylphenidate in the context of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The label includes comprehensive details on various adverse effects associated with methylphenidate use, but AMI is not listed among these effects.

Commonly observed adverse reactions in clinical trials included abdominal pain (in children and adolescents), decreased appetite, headache, dry mouth, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, decreased weight, irritability, and hyperhidrosis (in adults). There are mentions of cardiovascular effects such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, and there are specific warnings about the use of methylphenidate in patients with serious cardiac disease. However, the evidence provided does not directly associate AMI with methylphenidate use.

While serious cardiac adverse reactions are cautioned against, such as avoiding the drug in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac conditions, acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly referenced. The label also describes post-marketing experiences, including miscellaneous cardiac disorders like angina pectoris and various arrhythmias, but again, there is no direct citation of AMI as an observed adverse reaction.

Given the absence of explicit information linking methylphenidate to acute myocardial infarction in the provided label sections, it can be stated that there is no known evidence within these sources supporting a relationship between AMI as an adverse reaction and methylphenidate exposure. It is important to note, however, that the absence of a mention in this label does not entirely rule out the possibility; it only indicates that such an association wasn't present or identified in the sources referenced (clinical trials, case studies, post-marketing surveillance) at the time of your information cutoff.

Healthcare providers often make decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation of risks and potential adverse events, and concerns about rare but serious effects like AMI would be reviewed within the larger context of a patient's health status and history. For the most definitive and updated information, direct consultation with the drug manufacturer, a review of the latest scientific literature, and reports in pharmacovigilance databases would be necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,methylprednisolone,,"The relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the use of methylprednisolone is not directly established in the provided drug label sections you have presented. However, the label does list cardiovascular adverse reactions that are associated with corticosteroids like SOLU-MEDROL, including myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infaraction, which implies that myocardial infarction itself could potentially be worsened or influenced by the drug, particularly in patients with recent cardiac events.

Here's a concise summary of the relevant evidence from the provided sections:

1. Clinical Trials: There is no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction directly caused by methylprednisolone in the context of clinical trials within the provided label information. Clinical trials are usually a source of controlled data, but their findings are not detailed here.

2. Case Studies: The label does not reference any case studies that document acute myocardial infarction as a result of methylprednisolone use. Case studies can often provide insights into rare or unexpected adverse reactions not seen in larger trials.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance: The adverse reactions section typically includes data from post-marketing surveillance, suggesting that cardiovascular issues such as myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction have been observed. However, there is no explicit link made between methylprednisolone and the initial occurrence of acute myocardial infarction in these post-market reports.

4. Box Warnings: There is no box warning that specifically associates acute myocardial infarction with the use of methylprednisolone.

In summary, while the drug label mentions serious cardiovascular events, including complications following myocardial infarction, it does not provide evidence that directly links methylprednisolone with the onset of acute myocardial infarction. Due caution should be exercised when interpreting these findings, as corticosteroids like methylprednisolone can influence electrolyte balance, fluid retention, and hypertension, which are risk factors for myocardial infarction. More detailed research and analysis would be needed to establish a direct causal relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,methyltestosterone,,"The provided drug label sections for methyltestosterone indicate that cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction (heart attack), are listed under the adverse reactions observed with the use of this drug. This label information suggests that there has been some recognition or documentation of myocardial infarction as a potential adverse reaction to methyltestosterone.

Cardiovascular adverse reactions, such as myocardial infarction, are clinically relevant risks for anabolic and androgenic steroids, including methyltestosterone. These reactions can result from the various effects androgens have on the cardiovascular system, including alterations in lipid profiles, blood pressure, and possibly direct effects on the heart muscle and arteries.

However, to provide a more specific and detailed summary of the evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and methyltestosterone exposure, one would typically look into various sources of data such as:

1. Clinical Trials: Detailed findings from controlled clinical trials investigating the side effects of methyltestosterone administration. This could provide direct evidence of myocardial infarctions occurring in patients using the drug in a controlled setting.

2. Case Studies: Reports of individual patients or case series describing myocardial infarction following the use of methyltestosterone. This is valuable as detailed medical descriptions of timing, dose, outcomes, and potential mechanisms can be analyzed.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance: Data collected after the drug has been approved for use, including adverse event reporting, registries, or observational studies. This can capture rarer adverse events not seen in clinical trials.

As the drug label does mention cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction, and given the disclaimer for users to report suspected adverse reactions to the FDA, it can be inferred that there were reports of such events whether pre- or post-marketing that fueled the inclusion of myocardial infarction in the adverse reactions list.

In summary, the drug label itself is considered a primary source of evidence as it is a regulated document that reflects both clinical trial data that supported the drug's approval and post-marketing reports. Based on the label, there is an implication of a connection between methyltestosterone exposure and myocardial infarction. However, for an in-depth evaluation of the evidence, it would be necessary to examine the full clinical trial data, any case reports or series, and post-marketing data that led to this inclusion in the drug label. If further details from these sources were available, they would shed more light on the nature and strength of this evidence.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,metoprolol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, metoprolol has a known association with certain cardiovascular adverse reactions. In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), the label describes that exacerbation of angina and myocardial infarction may occur, especially if the drug is abruptly discontinued [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. This suggests that, while metoprolol itself is not directly cited as causing acute myocardial infarction, its inappropriate management, particularly abrupt cessation, can lead to adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction.

Clinical trials experience [Section 6.1] further outlines that in a randomized comparison of metoprolol and placebo in the setting of acute MI, certain adverse reactions were reported with specific frequencies. Although hypotension and bradycardia were more commonly reported with metoprolol than placebo, which are related cardiovascular parameters, acute myocardial infarction per se as an adverse event due to metoprolol was not specifically mentioned here.

Post-marketing experience [Section 6.2] describes adverse reactions identified after the approval of metopropyl that could not be unambiguously linked with the drug exposure due to the voluntary nature and uncertain size of the reporting population. This section does not mention acute myocardial infarction directly as an adverse event observed post-marketing.

To summarize, the provided label sections do not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction inherent to metoprolol use. However, there are warnings related to the potential exacerbation of myocardial ischemia when the drug is abruptly discontinued [Section 5.1]. This could potentially lead to myocardial infarction, indicating the importance of appropriate management of therapy rather than an inherent risk of the drug itself. Clinical trial data presented do not list MI as a common adverse reaction in the setting of acute MI [Section 6.1], and no direct evidence from post-marketing surveillance is provided that links metoprolol use to initiating acute myocardial infarction [Section 6.2].

It is important to consider that real-world evidence and further research could provide additional insights, and health care professionals rely on both the drug label and the broader body of medical literature when assessing the risks of therapies. For a comprehensive understanding, one should refer to an up-to-date collection of clinical evidence and post-market surveillance data beyond the drug label information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,micafungin,,"Based on the evidence provided from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of micafungin is not clearly established or frequently reported. Acute myocardial infarction is listed among other serious cardiac disorders in the section on adverse reactions in adult clinical trials, which includes various systemic organ classes. However, AMI specifically is mentioned under the category of ""other selected adverse reactions reported at less than 5%"" without detailing the incidence rate or establishing a definitive causal link to micafungin.

In clinical trial experiences with adult patients, cardiac disorders were observed in a percentage of trial participants. For instance, in one trial that compared micafungin to caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and other Candida infections, 35 (18%) of micafungin-treated patients experienced cardiac disorders. AMI falls under the cardiac disorders category but the report does not specify how many of these cases, if any, were diagnosed as AMI. 

In pediatric clinical trials, although cardiac disorders are reported, again, the specific incidence of AMI is not mentioned. It is difficult to ascertain the relationship between micafungin and AMI based on this information alone.

The postmarketing experience mentioned in the label also does not list AMI directly but does note that some serious adverse reactions have been identified through voluntary reporting, emphasizing that due to the nature of voluntary reporting, frequencies or causal relationships are hard to establish. 

In summary, while AMI is listed as a potentially serious adverse reaction of micafungin, the specific evidence linking micafungin to the occurrence of AMI is not detailed in the provided sections of the labeling. As with any medication, the risk of adverse reactions, including cardiac events, should be considered and closely monitored during treatment, but establishing a definitive causal relationship requires further clinical data and post-market surveillance information. The label guidance emphasizes reporting suspected adverse reactions to enable a better understanding of the drug's safety profile.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,midostaurin,,"**Evidence Summary:**

- **Clinical Trials:**
  Midostaurin, sold under the brand name Rydapt, has been evaluated for safety in clinical trials, specifically in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM) including aggressive SM, SM with associated hematological neoplasm, or mast cell leukemia.

  For AML patients, the drug label specifies the most common adverse reactions (ARs) observed but does not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common reaction. However, the label mentions that cardiac disorders such as hypertension and pericardial effusion were reported, with a lower frequency of ""myocardial infarction or ischemia"" in fewer than 10% of patients. As the evidence stands, no direct causal link between midostaurin and acute myocardial infarction in AML patients can be definitively established from the clinical trials data provided in the drug label, considering that AMI or cardiac-related events were not among the most frequently reported ARs.

- **Adverse Reaction Reports & Postmarketing Surveillance:**
  The label has drawn adverse drug reactions from postmarketing experience which includes voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and consumers. It does not explicitly reference acute myocardial infarction but notes serious ARs including cardiac events. Due to the nature of voluntary reporting, the frequency of these events or a causal relationship to the drug is not always clear.

- **Warnings and Precautions:**
  While the warnings and precautions section discusses risks such as pulmonary toxicity and embryo-fetal toxicity, there is no specific warning regarding the risk of AMI with midostaurin use.

Given the current evidence, it appears that acute myocardial infarction is not widely reported or recognized as a common adverse reaction of midostaurin in the context of AML and advanced SM based on the labeled clinical trial data and postmarketing experience. However, there are mentions of other cardiac disorders in a minority of patients and it should be considered that adverse reactions that are less common or that require longer durations of drug exposure to manifest might be underrepresented in clinical trial data.

**Conclusion:**
There is no direct evidence from the provided drug label that midostaurin commonly causes acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. However, some cardiac events have been reported, though less frequently. Further vigilance and reporting could clarify the relationship between midostaurin and cardiac events such as AMI. Health professionals should monitor patients on midostaurin for cardiac symptoms and consider the individual's risk factors for cardiac disease when evaluating potential adverse drug reactions.","The provided sections from the drug label for midostaurin (RYDAPT) indicate a range of adverse reactions identified during clinical trials and postmarketing experience among patients treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), advanced systemic mastocytosis (ASM), mast cell leukemia (SM-AHN), or myeloid sarcoma (MCL). However, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction or specifically identified in the provided sections of the drug label for midostaurin.

The sections do mention cardiac-related adverse reactions, but only hypertension, pericardial effusion, and myocardial infarction or ischemia as less common events (occurring in less than 10% of patients and at least 2% more frequently than in the placebo group). Additionally, they note cardiac failure and myocardial infarction or ischemia in ≤ 10% of patients without comparison to a placebo group. The absence of AMI as a common or significant adverse event in these detailed summaries suggests that there is no established evidence directly linking midostaurin exposure to the occurrence of AMI at the time of this label's publication.

It is important to note that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and a lack of reported association in the label does not confirm that the drug cannot cause AMI under certain or unobserved conditions. Postmarketing surveillance is critical for detecting rare adverse reactions that might not have been evident in clinical trials.

In conclusion, the evidence-refuting a relationship between midostaurin and acute myocardial infarction is implicit in its absence from the identified adverse reactions in the provided drug label sections for clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. However, vigilance during postmarketing surveillance remains important for updating this safety information."
acute myocardial infarction,mirtazapine,,"Evidence regarding acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a potential adverse reaction to mirtazapine is limited and not clearly established within the provided drug label information. However, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, are mentioned within the context of both clinical trial experience and postmarketing experience.

Clinical Trials:
The provided drug label, which includes clinical trial data, indicates that among 2796 patients treated with mirtazapine in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, infrequent cardiac adverse reactions included angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. However, the term 'infrequent' is categorized as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, suggesting that while there were reports of myocardial infarction, it was not a common occurrence in the context of these clinical trials.

Postmarketing Surveillance:
In the postmarketing experience, i.e., adverse events reported after the drug has been approved and marketed, myocardial infarction is listed under infrequent cardiovascular adverse reactions. Due to the nature of postmarketing reports, which are often voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Additionally, it is emphasized in the warnings and precautions section that mirtazaphine should be used with caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or other significant heart disease, though there is no direct assertion that mirtazapine causes AMI.

In summary, while there have been rare reports of myocardial infarction associated with mirtazapine use in clinical trials and postmarketing experience, the evidence is not sufficient to establish a clear causal relationship. Moreover, when myocardial infarction does occur, it is classified as an infrequent event. Health professionals should consider individual patient risk factors for cardiovascular disease and monitor for signs of cardiac events during mirtazapine therapy. As with all adverse reactions, clinicians should report suspected cases of myocardial infarction associated with mirtazapine to the appropriate pharmacovigilance systems to improve the understanding of this potential drug reaction.","Based on the provided drug label sections for mirtazapine, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and mirtazapine use. However, it is essential to note that under ""Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness"" in section 5.15, the label states that mirtazapine has not been systematically evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or other significant heart disease.

The label does mention the occurrence of infrequent adverse reactions in the cardiovascular system, including angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, as well as hypertension and vasodilatation being reported as frequent reactions. The term ""infrequent"" is defined by the label as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.

Additionally, the label does caution that mirtazapine should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease that could be exacerbated by hypotension, including those with a history of myocardial infarction.

Given the above information and the clinical trial data provided, while acute myocardial infarction is listed as an infrequent event during premarketing evaluations of mirtazapine, the information does not conclusively refute the possibility that mirtazapine might be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. It merely indicates that such occurrences are considered infrequent based on the available data.

Considering the potential seriousness of myocardial infarction, further in-depth studies would be required to definitively establish or refute any causal relationship with mirtazapine use. Health care professionals should evaluate the risks and benefits of mirtazapine in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.

NA is not an appropriate response in this context since evidence neither conclusively supports nor refutes the relationship between mirtazapine use and acute myocardial infarction. This response is based on the provided label information; no new sources of evidence beyond this data have been evaluated."
acute myocardial infarction,misoprostol,,"The evidence from the provided drug label suggests that acute myocardial infarction has been reported as an adverse event in individuals receiving misoprostol, although a causal relationship has not been established. In the ""Causal relationship unknown"" section of the adverse reactions, myocardial infarction (some fatal) is listed amongst other events where a causal relationship with misoprostol is uncertain but cannot be excluded.

The label references that chest pain and myocardial infarction, including some fatal cases, occurred, as well as other thromboembolic events like pulmonary embolism and arterial thrombosis. However, it does not provide specific data regarding the incidence, nor does it confirm that these events were directly caused by the drug or were merely an association.

Furthermore, the label indicates that there were no significant differences in the safety profile of misoprostol in aging populations, which could be relevant since older age can be a risk factor for myocardial infarction.

Based on the label's content, the evidence suggesting that myocardial infarction is a potential adverse reaction due to misoprostol comes from post-marketing surveillance data, which can include spontaneous reports and is less controlled than evidence from prospective clinical trials.

Since post-marketing reports often lack detailed information and are not subject to the rigor of controlled clinical trials, they can serve as signals for potential adverse reactions but don't alone offer conclusive proof of causation. To establish a definitive relationship, further studies, such as cohort studies or case-control studies, would typically be needed to control for confounding factors and to better assess causation.

In summary, while myocardial infarction has been reported in patients taking misoprostol, the available evidence within the provided label segments draws from post-marketing data and does not conclusively establish a causal relationship. Additional studies would be required for a more definitive evaluation of this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,mitoxantrone,,"Evidence Summary: Acute Myocardial Infarction and Mitoxantrone

The provided drug label sections contain detailed information on the adverse reactions, warnings, and specific case incidences related to the use of mitoxantrone. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to mitoxantrone is mentioned in the context of a clinical trial with multiple sclerosis patients:

In Study 1, a placebo-controlled trial involving multiple sclerosis patients, of the 64 patients in the placebo group, one patient experienced a myocardial infarction. However, no incidence of AMI was reported among patients receiving mitoxantrone, regardless of the dosage (5 mg/m2 or 12 mg/m2).

To summarize specific evidence related to myocardial infarction in the context of mitoxantrone usage:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- Study 1 (multiple sclerosis patients): 1 incident of myocardial infarction in the placebo group; no incidence reported in the mitoxantrone groups.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- The drug label does not provide direct reference to the incidence of AMI during post-marketing surveillance.

Cardiovascular Considerations:
- Cardiotoxicity, including congestive heart failure and EKG changes such as arrhythmias, has been associated with mitoxantrone use, which indicates a general risk for cardiovascular adverse events.

Warnings and Box Warnings:
- The label extensively discusses cardiotoxicity and includes a boxed warning about congestive heart failure (CHF) that may occur during or years after mitoxantrone therapy. The risk may increase with the cumulative dose of mitoxantrone.

Conclusions:
There is no direct evidence provided in the drug label to establish a causal relationship between mitoxantrone administration and acute myocardial infarction. The single case of myocardial infarction occurred in the placebo group and not in the mitoxantrone-treated cohorts in Study 1 involving multiple sclerosis patients. Nevertheless, since cardiotoxicity is a known and serious risk associated with mitoxantrone, further investigation into post-marketing data and additional clinical evidence would be necessary to conclusively determine whether AMI should be considered a potential adverse reaction specifically associated with mitoxantrone. It is worth monitoring for cardiovascular adverse events, as this drug carries a boxed warning regarding cardiotoxicity and is associated with other serious cardiovascular events.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,moexipril,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections for moexipril hydrochloride, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat hypertension, there is mention of a range of adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials and post-marketing experience. However, the information specifies that instances of angina/myocardial infarction (which includes acute myocardial infarction) were among the cardiovascular adverse events reported.

It should be noted that the frequency of such events appears to be low, as the label indicates that symptomatic hypotension, postural hypotension, syncope, angina/myocardial infarction, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, and cerebrovascular accidents are grouped together under cardiovascular events, and the drug label does not provide a specific incidence rate for myocardial infarction alone. This makes it difficult to assess the exact level of risk for this specific adverse reaction.

The inclusion of myocardial infarction within the label suggests that there have been reports of such events, but the lack of detailed incidence information does not allow for a conclusive assessment of the strength of the association or the frequency with which this adverse reaction occurs.

From this, it can be summarized that while there is some evidence in clinical or post-marketing data to suggest a potential relationship between moexipril hydrochloride and acute myocardial infarction, the evidence is not detailed in the drug label, and therefore the relationship may be considered to be less well-established compared to other documented adverse reactions. Given the serious nature of myocardial infarction, healthcare providers should remain vigilant and consider this potential risk when prescribing and monitoring patients on moexipril therapy.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the risk, it would be necessary to consult the original data from clinical trials, case studies, or detailed post-marketing surveillance reports, none of which are provided in the drug label excerpt you have submitted.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nabumetone,1.0,"The drug label information provided for nabumetone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reports various adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. Regarding your request for evidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction of nabumetone:

**Clinical Trials:**
Within the provided label sections, acute myocardial infarction is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction observed in US clinical trials of nabumetone (where rates of events greater than 1% are described). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal in nature. Cardiovascular adverse reactions were not reported as predominantly occurring at this frequency.

**Post-marketing Surveillance:**
However, under post-marketing experience, myocardial infarction is mentioned as an adverse reaction with an incidence of less than 1% with a causal relationship unknown. This indicates that there have been reports of myocardial infarction in patients taking nabumetone after the drug has been approved and marketed, but a direct causal relationship to the drug has not been established through these reports.

**Box Warnings and Warnings/Precautions:**
The box warnings highlight that NSAIDs, the class of drugs to which nabumetone belongs, carry an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. These risks may increase with the duration of use. However, the specific risk associated with nabumetone is not quantified in the label.

In summary, while myocardial infarction is listed as a rare post-marketing adverse event for nabumetone, and the class of NSAIDs carries a well-documented risk for serious cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, there is no evidence from clinical trials provided in the label that directly links nabumetone to an increased risk of AMI. It is important to interpret post-marketing reports with caution as they are not systematically collected and may not be directly attributable to the drug.

For a definitive assessment of risk, one would typically review additional sources such as peer-reviewed studies or large-scale meta-analyses that could provide more insight into the specific cardiovascular risks associated with nabumetone compared to other NSAIDs or baseline risk. However, such information is not provided within the drug label excerpt shared.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nafarelin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nafarelin (brand name Synarel), there is no direct evidence that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a recognized adverse reaction specifically attributed to nafarelin in clinical trial data. The adverse reactions listed in the sections provided focus on symptoms suggestive of drug sensitivity, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis effects, hypoestrogenism-related effects, and bone density changes associated with nafarelia in adults and pediatric patients.

However, in the post-marketing surveillance section, it is mentioned that cases of serious venous and arterial thromboembolism, including myocardial infarction, have been reported. These cases of myocardial infarction have occurred in temporal relation to drug exposure, but they are confounded by patient risk factors or concomitant medication use. The label indicates that ""It is unknown if there is a causal association between the use of GnRH analogs and these events.""

In conclusion, the current summary of the nafarelin drug label does not provide a definitive link between nafarelin use and acute myocardial infarction as a side effect. Reported cases of myocardial infarction in the context of nafarelin use are based on post-marketing surveillance data, which are not sufficient to establish causation, particularly given the presence of confounding factors.

As a result, this summary cannot confirm a relationship between nafarelin exposure and acute myocardial infarction based on the evidence available in clinical trials and formal studies. The post-marketing reports suggest a need for further investigation but do not establish a direct causal link.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,naltrexone,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for naltrexone hydrochloride, there is no direct evidence presented that links the drug to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction.

In several clinical trials mentioned, patients receiving naltrexone at recommended doses generally tolerated the drug well, with the most common adverse reactions being gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea) and other general symptoms like headache, dizziness, and fatigue. Serious adverse events were not reported during the trials focused on alcohol dependence. Elevated liver enzymes were noted at higher doses, indicating hepatocellular injury, which is a different concern than myocardial infarction.

The postmarketing experience enumerates a wide range of adverse events that have been reported, but these do not definitively include myocardial infarction. Moreover, these reports are not always clearly distinguishable from withdrawal symptoms. While various cardiovascular events such as tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and palpitations are mentioned, acute myocardial infarction is not specifically listed.

Given the absence of reported cases of myocardial infarction in the provided information, we cannot conclude there is a relationship between naltrexone exposure and acute myocardial infarction. It is always possible that additional data not included in this summary could provide different insights. Therefore, it is recommended to review the complete safety data, including the most recent studies and post-marketing reports, to assess the potential for such a risk comprehensively. If this is a concern, healthcare providers should monitor patients on naltrexone for any signs of cardiovascular issues and report any potential adverse cardiovascular events to pharmacovigilance agencies to support ongoing safety monitoring.","EVIDENCE REFUTING ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AS AN ADVERSE REACTION OF NALTREXONE:

Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as either an observed adverse event in clinical trials or a reported adverse event in post-marketing surveillance associated with naltrexone use. The adverse reactions section and reported adverse events in naltrexone hydrochloride clinical studies do not list AMI as a complication of naltrexone therapy. The most frequently mentioned adverse reactions are related to gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, as well as other symptoms like headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, and others.

Moreover, the cardiovascular events that are listed such as increased blood pressure, non-specific ECG changes, palpitations, and tachycardia are not specifically identified as leading to or being associated with AMI. None of the documented post-marketing experiences or observations in both alcohol dependence and opioid addiction populations, up to the cut-off knowledge date, directly relate naltrexone hydrochloride administration with the incidence of acute myocardial infarction.

Thus, according to the information provided in the drug label, it can be concluded that there is no direct evidence in the included clinical trials or post-marketing data suggesting that acute myocardial infarction is an adverse reaction attributable to naltrexone at the recommended doses for alcohol or opioid dependence treatment. It is important to note, however, that the absence of reported cases of AMI does not unequivocally rule out the possibility, and healthcare providers should remain vigilant and continue to report any unusual or serious adverse effects related to naltrexone use. The causality of such events, if observed in the future, would need to be carefully evaluated. 

Sources:
- Drug label sections provided for naltrexone which includes adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings."
acute myocardial infarction,naproxen,,"Evidence indicating a relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and naproxen exposure is primarily derived from information found in the boxed warnings, postmarketing experience, and sections detailing cardiovascular thrombotic events in the label.

**Boxed Warnings and Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events (5.1):**
The label clearly states that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include naproxen, carry an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. This risk may occur early in treatment and increases with the duration of use. These warnings are based on clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs. While the exact magnitude of the risk varies among NSAIDs, the trend remains consistent.

The warnings also highlight results from observational studies. For instance, post-myocardial infarction patients treated with NSAIDs demonstrated an increased risk of reinfarction and CV-related death starting from the first week of treatment. Moreover, it is recommended to avoid the use of naproxen in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events.

**Postmarketing Experience (6.2):**
Postmarketing reports, which include voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, also indicate that cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction have been observed in patients taking naproxen. While postmarketing surveillance helps capture rare events not necessarily seen in clinical trials, establishing a causal relationship solely from these reports can be challenging.

**Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):**
The sections detailing clinical trials do not specifically mention AMI as an observed adverse reaction to naproxen. Most common adverse reactions were related to gastrointestinal issues, central nervous system disturbances, and dermatologic complaints.

**Summary:**
The drug label for naproxen does indicate that there is evidence supporting the association between naproxen exposure and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. This is highlighted in the boxed warnings, which underscore the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction. Additionally, postmarketing experience, while not as robust as randomized controlled trials, adds support to this association. However, specific incidences from clinical trials solely focusing on naproxen were not detailed in the drug label.
",NA
acute myocardial infarction,naratriptan,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exposure to naratriptan, a triptan medication commonly used for the treatment of migraine headaches, is described in the provided drug label sections.

The drug label explicitly mentions that there have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, following administration of naratriptan tablets. Some of these events occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). The use of naratriptan may also lead to coronary artery vasospasm, which can manifest as Prinzmetal’s angina, even in patients without a history of CAD. These reports suggest a causal relationship between naratriptan and the occurrence of AMI, positioning AMI as a potential adverse reaction to the drug.

It is recommended that patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors undergo a cardiac evaluation before being prescribed naratriptan. Patients with a diagnosis of ischemic or vasospastic CAD are contraindicated for naratriptan use due to the risk of coronary vasospasm and the potential for serious cardiac events.

The sections from the drug label do not specify the incidence rate of AMI in clinical trials, but it is clear that the concern for AMI has been significant enough to warrant inclusion in the Warnings and Precautions (5.1), highlighting the importance of cardiac evaluations and the contraindication of naratriptan in certain patient populations. However, it is also mentioned that these events are rare.

In summary, while detailed incidence data from clinical trials regarding AMI as an adverse reaction to naratriptan is not provided, the drug label does indicate that this serious cardiac adverse reaction has been reported. These cases have led to specific contraindications and warnings for patients at risk of cardiac events, suggesting a recognized concern for the relationship between naratriptan exposure and AMI, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or signs of coronary vasospasm.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nebivolol,,"The provided drug label sections for nebivolol, a beta-blocker used mainly for the treatment of hypertension, suggest some adverse events associated with its use. However, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the summary of the clinical trials data presented in the adverse reactions section (6.1). The observed adverse reactions during clinical trials were consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug and included more frequent events such as headache, fatigue, bradycardia, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and other less common side effects.

In the postmarketing experience section (6.3), myocardial infarction is included as an adverse reaction identified from spontaneous reports, but the labeling notes that it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to nebivolol exposure due to the voluntary nature of reports and the uncertain size of the population.

The warnings and precautions section (5) mentions myocardial infarction in the context of abrupt cessation of therapy. Section 5.1 warns against abruptly discontinuing nebivolol in patients with coronary artery disease as severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers.

Section 5.2 states that nebivolol was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent myocardial infarction, so evidence from clinical trials concerning this specific patient population is not available.

Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is mention of myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction observed in the postmarketing experience but without an established causal relationship to nebivolol exposure and no frequency estimation. The clinical trials data do not specifically list AMI as a common adverse reaction. There is a warning related to the potential risk of myocardial infariction upon abrupt discontinuation of the medication in patients with existing coronary artery disease.

In summary, while there is reference to myocardial infarction in the postmarketing experience, there is no derived evidence from clinical trials that directly establishes a causal relationship between nebivololin use and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction. Further data from observational studies, large-scale patient registries, or additional systemic postmarketing surveillance would be beneficial to evaluate the relationship between nebivolol and acute myocardial infarction more comprehensively.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nicardipine,,"Evidence on the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and nicardipine use is not explicitly outlined within the provided drug label sections. However, there are some points to consider in evaluating the potential risk:

1. The drug label mentions that ""sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be due to disease progression, have been seen in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine."" This statement suggests that myocardial infarction has been observed in some patients using nicardipine, but it is not clear whether the medication directly caused these events or if they were due to underlying disease progression.

2. Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and angina, conditions related to coronary artery disease, which is a risk factor for AMI. The exacerbation of angina is listed as a rare event in chronic oral therapy in less than 1% of coronary artery disease patients treated with nicardipine, hinting at the possibility of drug-induced coronary events.

3. The label warns of the risk of symptomatic hypotension or tachycardia, which are potential complications that could indirectly contribute to cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, if severe or inadequately managed.

4. There are no reports from clinical trials directly linking nicardipine with AMI as a common adverse reaction. Most of the adverse reactions noted in clinical trials related to nicardipe involve vasodilation effects such as headache and nausea/vomiting.

5. Post-marketing surveillance is a valuable source of information for rare adverse events that may not be captured in clinical trials. However, the provided label information does not contain any quantitative data or specific case reports from post-marketing surveillance that establish a definite causal relationship between nicardipine and AMI.

6. The warning section of the label advises caution in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) or significant left ventricular dysfunction due to the in vitro observation of negative inotropic effects, which could theoretically increase the risk of myocardial infarction in susceptible individuals.

In conclusion, the provided drug label sections mention the observation of myocardial infarction in some patients on chronic oral nicardipine therapy, yet do not clearly establish this as a direct adverse reaction to the drug. Evidence from clinical trials is not provided in detail and post-marketing surveillance data is not specified in the label. Thus, while there may be an association, causality cannot be confirmed without further clinical data or detailed case reports. Caution is advised in interpreting these findings, and healthcare professionals should monitor patients using nicardipine for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction, particularly in individuals with existing cardiac conditions. 

Physicians considering the use of nicardipine should weigh the benefits against the potential risks, and patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction promptly. To establish a more definitive relationship between nicardipine and acute myocardial infarction, further clinical investigations, observational studies, and detailed analyses of post-marketing adverse event reports would be necessary.","Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and the exposure to nicardipine. The drug label mentions that sinus node dysfunction and myocardial infarction, which may be attributable to disease progression, have been observed in patients on chronic therapy with orally administered nicardipine. However, this does not establish a causal relationship, nor does it conclusively indicate that nicardipine does not contribute to the risk of AMI.

Clinical trials and post-marketing experiences haven’t reported AMI as a common adverse reaction to nicardipine, focusing instead on its vasodilatory side effects such as headache, hypotension, and tachycardia. The absence of AMI as a commonly reported adverse event in these sources may suggest that if there is a risk, it is likely to be low or obscured by other cardiovascular variables.

For a definitive statement, we would require access to large-scale observational studies, randomized controlled trials, or meta-analyses that have specifically investigated the incidence of AMI in patients taking nicardipine compared to those who are not, and such information is not provided within the scope of the labeled sections shared.

In the absence of this specific evidence, we cannot conclusively refute the relationship between AMI and nicardipine use. It is also important to consider individual patient risk factors and co-morbid conditions that may independently increase the risk for AMI. Health care providers should remain vigilant for any signs of cardiac events in patients using nicardipine and report them via appropriate pharmacovigilance channels."
acute myocardial infarction,nifedipine,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label information, evidence suggesting a potential relationship between nifedipine exposure and acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction includes the following:

1. **Clinical Trials Data**: Within controlled studies, adverse events were reported to be generally frequent but not often serious, with most adverse effects expected due to the vasodilator properties of nifedipine. Specific rates of myocardial infarction were not mentioned in the provided label's section on adverse reactions from these controlled studies.

2. **Uncontrolled Experience in the US**: An uncontrolled experience involving over 2,100 patients was cited. In this population, myocardial infarction occurred in approximately 4% of patients. This suggests that there have been observed cases of myocardial infarction; however, it is crucial to note that the label does not establish a direct causal relationship. Rather, it states that these serious adverse events are ""not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients,"" which indicates a possibility of the events being related to the underlying disease rather than the drug itself.

3. **Subgroup of Patients with Congestive Heart Failure and Angina Pectoris**: In this subgroup of around 250 patients, myocardial infarction occurred in about one in 15 patients. This again suggests an observed incidence of myocardial infarction though, similar to the above point, a causal relationship with nifedipine is not clearly established.

4. **Post-Marketing Surveillance**: No specific mention of acute myocardial infarction was made in the context of post-marketing surveillance within the provided information.

5. **Clinical Context**: It is noted that there may be an increase in anginal pain upon introduction of nifedipine therapy, potentially due to hypotension. This could theoretically be relevant to myocardial infarction as an adverse event, especially if hypotension is severe enough to compromise coronary perfusion, though this is speculative and not explicitly supported by the provided label data.

In summary, while there is evidence of myocardial infarction occurring in patients treated with nifedipine from uncontrolled experiences and a specific patient subgroup, the drug label itself suggests that these events may not be distinguishable from the natural progression of underlying cardiac conditions. As such, a direct causal relationship between nifedipine exposure and acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction is not clearly established or quantified in the provided drug label information. Additional controlled studies, case reports, and assessments of post-marketing data would be necessary to more definitively establish such a relationship.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nilotinib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for Tasigna (nilotinib), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not explicitly listed as an adverse reaction. However, there is evidence of cardiovascular adverse reactions associated with nilotinib usage.

From clinical trial experiences and post-marketing surveillance, the adverse reactions associated with nilotinib include myelosuppression, QT prolongation, sudden deaths, cardiac and arterial vascular occlusive events, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, hemorrhage, and fluid retention.

Particularly relevant to your question, under Warnings and Precautions (section 5.4), the drug label notes that ""Cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events, were reported in a randomized, clinical trial in newly diagnosed CML patients and observed in the postmarketing reports of patients receiving Tasigna therapy."" It mentions that with a median time on therapy of 60 months, cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events which could potentially lead to myocardial infarction, were reported. Specifically, ischemic heart disease-related cardiac events were reported in 5% and 9% of patients in the 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms of Tasigna, respectively, compared to 2.5% in the imatinib arm.

These data suggest a relationship between nilotinib and cardiac events, which could potentially include acute myocardial infarction, particularly given that ischemic heart disease can result in AMI. However, the drug label does not specify AMI as a distinct adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experiences.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is not specifically listed as an adverse reaction in the sections provided for Tasigna, there is clinical trial evidence and post-marketing experience of cardiovascular events associated with Tasigna, which may include or contribute to the occurrence of AMI. Health care providers should closely monitor patients for signs of cardiovascular events during nilotinib treatment and manage cardiovascular risk factors as recommended in the label.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nintedanib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and nintedanib exposure predominantly comes from clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of the drug, as outlined in the provided drug label sections.

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) clinical trials (Study 1 – Phase 2, Study 2, and Study 3 – Phase 3), comprising 723 patients treated with nintedanib (OFEV 150 mg twice daily) and 508 patients who received a placebo, myocardial infarction (MI) was documented as a serious adverse reaction that occurred more frequently in the nintedanib group compared to the placebo group (1.5% vs. 0.4%). Additionally, myocardial infarction was among the most common adverse events leading to death in nintedanib-treated patients (0.3% vs. 0.2% in placebo). Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including MI, demonstrated fatal outcomes in 0.6% of nintedanib-treated patients versus 1.8% in the placebo group.

Moreover, arterial thromboembolic events, which can potentially include conditions like MI, were reported in 2.5% of nintedanib-treated patients from the same IPF studies, which is a notably higher rate than the one reported in placebo-treated patients (less than 1%). The trials did not specify individual cardiovascular risk factors for each patient, which might affect the overall assessment of drug-related risk.

In other studies examining the effects of nintedanib on different forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), reports of MI were less common or not elevated compared to placebo. In the SSc-ILD Study 4, there were no cases of MI reported in the nintedanib group, comparable with the placebo group.

No specific case studies or post-marketing data from the provided sections directly link acute myocardial infarction to nintedanib outside of the general statement about arterial thromboembolic events observed with its use. However, the drug label instructions advise caution when treating patients at higher risk for cardiovascular events, including known coronary artery disease.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials suggests a potential increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with nintedanib treatment in patients with IPF. However, this potential adverse reaction appears to be relatively infrequent and should be weighed against the benefit of treatment. No additional case studies or post-market surveillance data specifically related to MI were provided in the label sections.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nintedanib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nintedanib (OFEV), evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trial Evidence:
- In the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) clinical trials (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), myocardial infarction was reported as a serious adverse event more frequently in patients treated with nintedanib compared to placebo (1.5% vs. 0.4%).
- The most common adverse events leading to death in nintedanib-treated patients, more than placebo, included myocardial infarction (0.3% vs. 0.2%).
- In the predefined category of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including myocardial infarction, fatal events were reported in 0.6% of nintedanib-treated patients and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients.
- In the chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5), myocardial infarction was observed in less than 1% of patients in both the nintedanib and placebo arms.
- In the systemic sclerosis-associated ILD trial (Study 4), there were no cases of myocardial infarction reported in nintedanib-treated patients (0 cases) compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- Arterial thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, have been reported as an adverse reaction during post-marketing experience with nintedanib.
- In post-marketing experience, non-serious and serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been observed. While this is not specific to AMI, it implies a potential for cardiovascular-related adverse events in the post-marketing setting.

Boxed Warnings and Other Warnings:
- Although warnings regarding arterial thromboembolic events have been included, specifically advising caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease, direct mention of myocardial infarction in the boxed warnings or other specific warnings sections is not present.

Based on this information, myocardial infarction is documented as an adverse event in clinical trials of nintedanib, particularly in the IPF studies where its occurrence was higher in nintedanib-treated patients compared to placebo. Similarly, AMI has been reported in post-marketing surveillance, although the incidence rate is not provided. There are no specific boxed warnings related to myocardial infarction, but there is a general caution about the use of nintedanib in patients with higher cardiovascular risk, implying an awareness of potential cardiovascular adverse events.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nisoldipine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for nisoldipine, the evidence for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to nisoldipine is as follows: 

Clinical Trials: 
The label indicates that in clinical trials involving more than 6,000 patients worldwide for the treatment of hypertension with nisoldipine (either immediate release or extended-release formulations), myocardial infarction is listed as one of the adverse events. However, it is important to note that the evidence from these trials does not establish a causal relationship between nisoldipine and myocardial infarction. The listed adverse events, including myocardial infarction, are reported with a stipulation that a causal relationship to nisolderpine treatment cannot be confirmed (""Although a causal relationship of Nisoldipine to these events cannot be established, they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship with Nisoldipine treatment"").

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The label does not specifically mention acute myocardial infarction in the section on post-marketing events. It reports a very rarely observed systemic hypersensitivity reaction in the post-marketing setting that may include a diverse set of symptoms but does not explicitly reference AMI.

Case Studies:
The provided sections of the drug label do not include any mention of specific case studies regarding acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to nisoldipine.

Overall, while myocardial infarction is listed among adverse events witnessed in clinical trials for nisoldipine, the evidence does not explicitly confirm a direct causal relationship with the drug. It is critical for healthcare providers to consider this potential adverse event, despite the lack of conclusive evidence, and to monitor patients accordingly when prescribing and managing treatment with nisoldipine. For a definitive assessment, further research and detailed analysis of clinical data would be required to establish a direct causal link, if one exists.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,nortriptyline,1.0,"The drug label for nortriptyline, which falls within the class of tricyclic antidepressants, lists myocardial infarction (MI) as one of the potential cardiovascular adverse reactions. Such inclusion suggests there is an awareness of the possibility of acute MI occurring in patients taking nortriptyline. This does not, however, specify the frequency of occurrences or establish a direct causal relationship, although it indicates recognition of such an event during the use of this medication.

Clinical Trials:
Direct evidence from controlled clinical trials that specifically demonstrates a causal relationship between nortriptyline and acute myocardial infarction may not be readily distinguishable from existing data. Clinical trials often focus on the efficacy and general safety of a drug, so detailed analysis of rare adverse events like myocardial infarction may not be a primary outcome measure. If clinical trials did record instances of MI, the information could be found in the results section of those trials, where serious adverse events are reported. Without explicit references to such trials, we cannot assume that documented trials offer supporting evidence for this relationship.

Case Studies:
Individual case studies may provide insight into rare or serious adverse reactions to medications, including myocardial infarction. If MI associated with nortriptyline use was reported as a case study in a peer-reviewed scientific publication, this would represent an observed incident and offer insight into potential mechanisms or contributing factors. However, the label does not reference specific case studies which would directly support this relationship.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The label's mention of myocardial infarction might be based on post-marketing surveillance data, which includes voluntary reports from healthcare providers and patients after the drug's approval. Such adverse effects may not have been apparent during clinical trials due to their rarity or long-term emergence. Reporting such post-marketing events helps to continue evaluation of a drug's safety profile. Nonetheless, voluntary reporting systems have limitations, including underreporting, incomplete information, and a lack of direct causality confirmation.

Black Box Warnings:
There is no black box warning on the nortriptyline label specifically regarding the risk of myocardial infarction. The black box warning provided primarily addresses the risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults.

In summary, while the label for nortriptyline includes myocardial infarction as a reported adverse reaction, it does not provide explicit evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or detailed post-marketing surveillance data to establish a direct causal relationship. The mention in the drug label does alert practitioners and patients to the potential risk, suggesting that it has been observed in some form during the drug's use. To fully evaluate the strength of the association between nortriptyline and acute MI, detailed reviews of pharmacovigilance data or further dedicated research would be required. Without access to more granular data or cited studies in the label, it is not possible to offer a precise summary of evidence for the relationship between nortriptyline exposure and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,octreotide,,"The given information provides an extensive list of adverse reactions associated with the use of octreotide, specifically the brand MYCAPSSA, which is a medication used to treat acromegaly—a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone production typically due to a pituitary tumor.

The provided drug label sections mention various adverse reactions, such as gastrointestinal issues, cholelithiasis, and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism (hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia), and thyroid function abnormalities that were observed during clinical studies. Additionally, cardiac function abnormalities including bradycardia, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias/tachycardia were reported in an open-label study, occurring in up to 2% of patients.

Importantly, under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section, myocardial infarction is listed as one of the adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of octreotide acetate. This implies that while myocardial infarction was not a reported side effect in the controlled clinical trial environment, cases have been observed and reported in a wider population of patients using the medication after it became commercially available. Postmarketing surveillance is a vital tool for identifying rare adverse reactions that might not have been detected in clinical trials, often due to the smaller sample sizes or shorter duration of study periods.

However, it's critical to clarify that while myocardial infarction is listed in the postmarketing experience, the label does not elaborate on the frequency of these events or establish a direct causal relationship between octreotide exposure and acute myocardial infarction. Establishing causality with postmarketing data is often challenging because of potential confounding factors, such as the patients' underlying health conditions, concomitant medications, and the voluntary nature of reporting.

In conclusion, while there is an indication based on postmarketing data that acute myocardial infarction may be an adverse reaction associated with the use of octreotide, the available evidence does not establish a direct causal relationship. For healthcare professionals and patients, this information is critical for monitoring and making informed decisions regarding the risks and benefits of octreotide therapy. If further details or clarification are needed, healthcare providers should consult the full prescribing information, report adverse events as necessary, and review medical literature for any additional studies or case reports that may provide more context or details on this potential adverse reaction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,olmesartan,,"The potential relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the use of olmesartan is supported by limited and inconclusive evidence mainly derived from the ROADMAP clinical trial and a large epidemiological study.

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**
The ROADMAP (Randomized Olmesartan And Diabetes MicroAlbuminuria Prevention trial) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study that evaluated the effects of olmesartan (40 mg daily) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normoalbuminuria, and at least one cardiac risk factor. The study met its primary endpoint in delaying the onset of microalbuminuria but found an increased, although not statistically significant, occurrence of cardiovascular mortality in the olmesartan group compared to placebo, mainly from adjudicated sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, and revascularization death (15 olmesartan vs. 3 placebo, HR 4.9, 95% CI, 1.4 to 17). Moreover, the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction appeared lower with olmesartan in this trial (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.18).

**Epidemiological Study Evidence:**
The large epidemiological study looked at patients 65 years and older with overall exposure exceeding 300,000 patient-years. In diabetic patients receiving high-dose olmesartan (40 mg/day) for more than six months, there seemed to be an increased risk of death compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.8).

In both sources, there were concerns about the credibility of the findings related to increased cardiovascular risk, especially since the epidemiological study also indicated a potential survival benefit in non-diabetic patients taking high-dose olmesartan.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
In the post-marketing experience, there have been voluntary reports of adverse reactions, but due to the nature of such reporting, it is challenging to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure or reliably estimate frequency.

**Conclusion:**
Based on available evidence, there is an indication from one controlled trial (ROADMAP) and post-market observational data suggesting a potential increased risk of cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients. However, this evidence is not conclusive, and overall, the data raise a concern rather than establish a clear causal relationship. It is important to interpret these findings with caution due to the limitations and potential biases inherent in post-marketing surveillance and observational studies.

Careful consideration and discussion with healthcare providers are warranted when evaluating the benefits and risks of olmesartan therapy, particularly in diabetic patients and those with additional cardiovascular risk factors.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse reaction directly attributed to olmesartan exposure in either the clinical trials or post-marketing experience. Instead, the label describes a complex relationship with cardiovascular risk that requires careful interpretation. The ROADMAP clinical trial found no beneficial effect of olmesartan on the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo, predominantly from sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, and other causes, rather than a direct causality of myocardial infarction. It’s important to note that these findings pertain to a specific patient population (type 2 diabetics with additional cardiovascular risk factors), and the applicability of this result to the general population may not be direct.

Nonetheless, the trial reported a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction with olmesartan use (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35-1.18), indicating no clear evidence of an increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction associated with the drug in that particular study. Further epidemiological study raised the concern of a possible increased cardiovascular risk with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients, while suggesting a decreased risk of death in non-diabetic patients compared to those taking other angiotensin receptor blockers.

To summarize, current evidence from the data provided does not conclusively establish acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of olmesartan. It is essential to consider this evidence in the context of the populations studied and the multifactorial nature of cardiovascular risk."
acute myocardial infarction,oxaprozin,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and oxaprozin exposure can be inferred from several sections of the drug's label. However, it is crucial to note that the label does not explicitly list AMI as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials.

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
While specific data on AMI are not provided in the clinical trial results (section 6.1), cardiovascular system-related adverse events, such as edema, are mentioned as being observed at an incidence greater than 1%. However, these results do not specifically describe AMI as an observed adverse reaction.

2. Post-Marketing Experience:
In the post-marketing experience section (6.2), while various cardiovascular adverse reactions are reported with NSAID use, including oxaprozin, it is important to recognize that post-marketing surveillance often lacks the rigor of controlled clinical trials and relies on voluntary reporting, which can lead to underreporting or lack of detailed information establishing a causal relationship.

3. Box Warning and Warnings and Precautions:
The label includes a boxed warning (Sections WARNING and 5.1) stating an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This applies to NSAIDs in general and is based on clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years. Although oxaprozin is not specifically mentioned, it falls within this medication class and carries the same warnings.

The evidence on the relationship between oxaprozin and AMI is mainly precautionary and is derived from class effects observed with NSAID use. It is based on metadata analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies that have linked NSAID use with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (Section 5.1). While individual trials for oxaprozin may not have reported AMI as a frequent adverse event, the overarching data for NSAIDs suggest potential cardiovascular risks, including AMI.

In conclusion, there is no direct evidence from oxaprozin-specific clinical trials that details the incidence of AMI as an adverse reaction. However, the general class effects of NSAIDs, as noted in the boxed warning and the broader scientific literature on NSAIDs, indicate a potential risk for serious cardiovascular events, including AMI. Patients using oxaprozin should be monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia, and the use of the medication should be with caution, especially in patients with known cardiovascular disease or risk factors.","NA
Based on the information provided from the drug label, oxaprozin carries a documented risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI). The label explicitly mentions that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which includes oxaprozin, cause an increased risk of these events. This increased risk can occur early in the treatment and may rise with prolonged use. Therefore, refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and oxaprozin exposure is not supported by the evidence available in the drug label, and no summary of evidence refuting this relationship can be provided."
acute myocardial infarction,paclitaxel,,"The provided drug label for protein-bound paclitaxel (specifically referring to the albumin-bound formulation) contains extensive data on various adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. However, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is commonly known as a heart attack, is not explicitly listed among the adverse reactions in the sections provided.

The cardiovascular adverse reactions mentioned in the label include:
- Severe cardiovascular events occurred in approximately 3% of patients, which included cardiac ischemia/infarction, chest pain, cardiac arrest, and other related events.
- Hypotension and bradycardia were also reported and occurred during the 30-minute infusion of the drug.

Within the severe cardiovascular events category, cardiac ischemia/infarction encompasses heart attacks. Although the term ""acute myocardial infarction"" is not specifically used in the provided sections, ""cardiac ischemia/infarction"" is noted, which suggests that AMI did occur during the course of treatment with protein-bound paclitaxel in approximately 3% of patients. 

Based on this, there is evidence to support that acute myocardial infarction can be an adverse reaction of protein-bound paclitaxel. The source of this evidence is the clinical trials as included in the drug's label. As for post-marketing surveillance, although specifically AMI is not listed, given the nature of adverse event reporting, it is possible that such cases may have been reported.

In summary, the provided drug label does include cardiac ischemia/infarction, which encompasses acute myocardial infarction, as an adverse reaction to protein-bound paclitaxel. This supports the relationship between AMI and the drug at a reported incidence of approximately 3% for severe cardiovascular events.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,pantoprazole,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for pantoprazole, there is no direct evidence within the listed clinical trial data, post-marketing experience, or noted warnings and precautions that suggests an association between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of pantoprazole.

The adverse reactions section (6.1) of the label details common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials for pantoprazole, such as headache, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain for adults, with similar reactions plus upper respiratory infection (URI), fever, and rash for pediatric use. More serious adverse events described elsewhere in the labeling include acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, C. difficile-associated diarrhea, bone fracture, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus, vitamin B-12 deficiency, and hypomagnesemia.

The postmarketing experience section (6.2) lists adverse reactions that have been identified after the approval of pantoprazole based on voluntary reports. These include, among others, fundic gland polyps, hematologic effects like pancytopenia and agranulocytosis, hepatobiliary disorders, immune system disorders like anaphylaxis, and renal and genitourinary disorders. However, acute myocardial infarction is not mentioned as an observed adverse reaction in the postmarketing data.

Given the lack of any specific mention of AMI either in the context of clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance in the provided drug labeling for pantoprazole, it can be stated that, as of the knowledge cutoff date for this summary, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between pantoprazole and acute myocardial infarction. If there were concerns or case reports suggesting such an association, these would potentially be included in the label under warnings, precautions, or postmarketing experience—but they are not.

It is essential for healthcare providers to report suspected adverse reactions to drug regulatory agencies, such as the FDA in the United States, so they can be assessed and, if warranted, included in future updates to drug labeling.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for pantoprazole, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. The listed adverse reactions and warnings do not indicate that AMI has been observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience related to the use of pantoprazole. The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal in nature (e.g., headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) and other reactions like acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, bone fractures, and severe cutaneous reactions, among others. None of the sections 5 (Warnings and Precautions) or 6 (Adverse Reactions) include any information suggesting a link between pantoprazole usage and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction.

Refuting a causal relationship between a drug and a potential adverse reaction, such as acute myocardial infarction, often involves analyzing data from randomized controlled trials, epidemiological studies, case-controlled studies, and post-marketing surveillance that show no significant increase in the incidence of the event compared to control groups or the general population. In the case of pantoprazole, no evidence is presented within the provided sections indicating an association with acute myocardial infarction.

It is, however, important to note that the absence of an adverse reaction in drug labeling does not definitively mean there is no relationship; it may indicate that the event is rare, has not been reported, or has not been established as causally related through clinical studies or post-marketing surveillance. If we were to refute a relationship conclusively, we would rely on specific studies or comprehensive reviews demonstrating the lack of association between pantoprazole and acute myocardial infarction. Given that no such studies are cited or summarized in the provided sections, we can only state that acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an observed adverse reaction for pantoprazole."
acute myocardial infarction,paroxetine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for paroxetine, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse event in the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data related to the use of this drug. The sections provided describe various adverse reactions associated with paroxetine use, but AMI is not listed among them.

The adverse reactions included in the label are primarily related to the central nervous system (such as somnolence, dizziness, and insomnia), gastrointestinal system (such as nausea, constipation, and diarrhea), sexual function (such as abnormal ejaculation and libido decreased), and other general body system reactions (such as asthenia and sweating).

Additionally, under ""Cardiovascular System,"" where one might expect to find information related to AMI, only hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, migraine, postural hypotension, and syncope are listed as frequent or infrequent, with more severe cardiac events such as arrhythmias, ischemic events, and myocardial infarction described as rare.

In conclusion, the evidence from the sections of the drug label provided does not support the relationship between the use of paroxetine and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. If additional data from more extensive studies or pharmacovigilance databases exist outside of this provided label information, they are not included here for evaluation. Therefore, based on the current information, there is no known evidence supporting the relationship between AMI as an adverse reaction and paroxetine drug exposure. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor the literature and pharmacovigilance reports for updated information on drug safety.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,perindopril,,"Based on the information provided in the drug label sections for perindopril erbumine, there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The sections describe various potential adverse reactions and warnings associated with perindropil erbumine but do not list AMI among them. Here's a summary of the evidence as per the provided sections:

**Clinical Trial Experience (6.1)**:
- Perindopril has been evaluated in roughly 3,400 patients with hypertension in clinical trials. 
- In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was comparable between perindopril and placebo (6.5% and 6.7% respectively).
- Common adverse events in patients treated with perindopril included cough, headache, asthenia, and dizziness. Back pain and cough were notably more frequent with perindopril than placebo.
- Hypotension was associated with perindopril use in 0.3% of uncomplicated hypertensive patients and symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension in another 0.8% of patients.
- Perindopril was also assessed in the EUROPA study for safety in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Again, AMI is not cited as a common adverse event leading to discontinuation. Cough, drug intolerance, and hypotension were more frequent reasons for stopping the drug.

**Postmarketing Experience (6.2)**:
- Voluntary reports of adverse events of unknown causal relationship include several serious conditions such as cardiac arrest and eosinophilic pneumonitis, but AMI is not specified.
 
Since there's no explicit mention of AMI being an adverse reaction to perindopril in the provided drug label sections, any link between perindopril exposure and acute myocardial infarction is not evident from this source of evidence.

**Warnings (5)**:
- Warnings that are related to cardiac events focus on hypotension and related risks in certain populations, but do not mention AMI. 
- The label underlines the importance of monitoring renal function and the potential for hyperkalemia, which can have cardiac effects, but again does not mention AMIs directly.
- The label includes a WARNING for fetal toxicity, highlighting risks associated with affecting the renin-angiotensin system during pregnancy.

In conclusion, based on the data provided, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a known adverse reaction connected to the use of perindopril in the label. For a definitive assessment, a thorough review of the literature, including independent clinical trials and observational studies, would be necessary. In situations where a suspicion of a new adverse reaction arises, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report these events to the drug manufacturer or regulatory agencies to facilitate further investigation and monitoring.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,phenylephrine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction and exposure to phenylephrine hydrochloride is not explicitly detailed in the drug label sections provided. However, there are related cardiovascular adverse reactions identified in the literature and from post-marketing surveillance, which are associated with the use of phenylephrine and can be considered relevant to the potential for myocardial infarction:

1. **Cardiac Disorders**: The label notes myocardial ischemia as a reported adverse event. Myocardial ischemia is a condition where blood flow to the heart is reduced, which can potentially lead to an acute myocardial infarction if the ischemia is severe and prolonged.

2. **Warnings and Precautions**: The label warns that phenylephrine hydrochloride can exacerbate angina in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or a history of angina. Since angina is a symptom of underlying heart disease and can precede myocardial infarction, this exacerbation suggests a plausible but indirect association with acute myocardial infarction.

3. **Pressor Effects**: Phenylephrine is known for its vasopressor effects due to its adrenergic receptor activity. These effects include an increase in blood pressure, which may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, especially in susceptible individuals or those with preexisting cardiovascular conditions.

4. **Peripheral and Visceral Ischemia**: The drug can cause vasoconstriction leading to ischemia in vital organs, which implies that if the coronary arteries are affected, there could be an increased risk for myocardial infarction.

While these points suggest a potential for an association between phenylephrine use and acute myocardial infarction, there is no direct evidence, such as specific clinical trial data or case studies, provided in the drug label sections referenced that establishes a definitive causal relationship. The relationship is more inference-based rather than directly evidenced.

It should be noted that the adverse reactions section states that myocardial ischemia has been identified in association with phenylephrine hydrochloride use but does not quantify the frequency or establish a causal relationship due to the voluntary nature of the reports and the uncertainty of the population size.

While the information provided implies a possible relationship between phenylephrine and acute myocardial infarction through related adverse cardiovascular effects, to establish a definitive connection, one would need to consider additional sources of evidence such as peer-reviewed clinical studies or case reports that explicitly report on acute myocardial infarction incidence in patients following phenylephrine administration.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,pilocarpine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for pilocarpine, including adverse reactions and warnings, there is no direct evidence provided that links acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to the use of pilocarpine. The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with pilocarpine in the referenced clinical trials pertain to ocular and visual disturbances, such as headache/browache, accommodative change, blurred vision, eye irritation, visual impairment, and eye pain.

The warnings and precautions section does not mention myocardial infarction; instead, it provides guidance on caution in conditions of poor illumination, pre-existing retinal disease, iritis, primary congenital glaucoma, and contact lens wear.

To further investigate the relationship between pilocarpine and acute myocardial infarction, one would need to explore additional sources beyond the drug label, such as clinical trial databases, medical literature, and post-marketing surveillance reports. If these sources yielded case reports or epidemiological data suggesting a link, it would be important to evaluate the strength and consistency of the association, the presence of a dose-response relationship, the temporal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event, biological plausibility, and consideration of alternative explanations.

However, given that such sources of evidence have not been provided here, and based on the available information from the drug label, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the use of pilocarpine. Health professionals should report any suspected adverse reactions to appropriate surveillance systems like the FDA MedWatch program to facilitate the detection of potential rare adverse events not identified in the initial clinical trials.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,pioglitazone,,"The provided drug label sections concerning pioglitazone contain extensive details about various adverse reactions associated with its use, warnings, and precautions for its prescription. However, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction directly related to pioglitazone within these sections. 

The sections do detail an extensive clinical trial known as the PROactive trial, which involved patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease. While the primary focus of the trial was not AMI specifically, it did include nonfatal myocardial infarction, including silent myocardial infarction, as part of its composite primary endpoint. In the results of the PROactive trial, there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this cardiovascular composite, which included myocardial infarction. This suggests that within the context of this particular trial, pioglitazone was not associated with a statistically significant increase in AMI events when compared to placebo.

It is important to note that clinical trial findings do not necessarily cover all potential adverse reactions, and post-marketing surveillance data are vital for ongoing safety monitoring of a drug. The provided sections do mention postmarketing reports of adverse reactions, but again, AMI is not listed explicitly. The label indicates reports of congestive heart failure associated with pioglitazone use, which can sometimes be a consequence of AMI, but this is not the same as stating that AMI is a direct adverse reaction to the drug.

In conclusion, based on the provided information from the drug label, there is no direct evidence within clinical trial data or postmarketing surveillance reports presented that conclusively supports a relationship between pioglitazone use and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. If more detailed information from other clinical research or post-marketing studies is available, it would be required to make a stronger assessment of the potential relationship between pioglitazone and AMI.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,piroxicam,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and exposure to piroxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Clinical trials involving various NSAIDs, of which piroxicam is a member, have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. The risk is elevated with higher doses and prolonged use. The section ""Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events"" under the ""Warnings and Precautions (5.1)"" in the drug label discusses this in detail.
- However, it is noted that clinical trial conditions can vary greatly, and direct comparisons between different drug trials are challenging.

Postmarketing Experience:
- The ""Postmarketing Experience"" section lists myocardium infarction as an identified adverse reaction during post-approval use of piroxicam. It's important to note that since these reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, it's difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a direct causal relationship to drug exposure.

Boxed Warnings:
- The drug label contains a Boxed Warning that highlights the risk of serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, associated with the use of NSAIDs like piroxicam. These risks are increased with the duration of use and can occur early in treatment.
- It is also noted that piroxicam should be used with caution following a recent myocardial infarction since NSAID use in the post-MI setting has been associated with increased risk of reinfarction and CV-related death in observational studies.

Other Sources:
- While specific clinical trials focused solely on piroxicam and AMI are not detailed in the provided label, evidence from trials and observational studies of other NSAIDs indicates that such risks may be inherent to the drug class, which includes piroxicam.

In summary, the relationship between AMI and piroxicam use is supported by clinical trials of NSAIDs (including piroxicam), postmarketing adverse reaction reports, and the significant enough concern to warrant a Boxed Warning on the label. To minimize these risks, piroxicam should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible, and both physicians and patients should remain vigilant for any signs of cardiovascular events during treatment.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,pomalidomide,,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and the exposure to pomalidomide can be gathered from several sections of the drug label provided. It's important to note that drug labels summarize the essential scientific information that includes evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and case studies when available.

According to the provided sections, under the WARNING section of the label, it is clearly stated that patients treated with Pomalidomide have experienced venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction, and stroke. This suggests that clinical evidence was found during drug development or post-marketing surveillance that linked Pomalidomide with an increased risk of these cardiovascular events.

More specifically, under ""Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism (5.3)"" within the Warnings and Precautions, the drug label mentions that AMI is one of the arterial thromboembolic events observed in patients treated with Pomalidomide. In Trial 2, which is cited in the warning, arterial thromboembolic events (which would include AMI) occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex. This data directly links Pomalidomide usage to an increased risk of myocardial infarction and is derived from a controlled clinical context.

The label also advises that patients with known risk factors for thrombosis may be at greater risk and recommends thromboprophylaxis based on the patient's risk factors.

Under the ""Postmarketing Experience (6.2)"" section, additional adverse reactions reported after the drug's approval are listed. However, AMI is not individually listed here, indicating that there may not be significant reported cases or evidence of AMI solely from post-marketing surveillance that is separate from the information captured in clinical trial data.

To conclude, the evidence supporting the relationship between the risk of acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to Pomalidomide primarily comes from controlled clinical trials, which is reflected in the drug's warning label. It specifically indicates the occurrence of arterial thromboembolic events, including AMI, in patients receiving the drug. This evidence is used to inform healthcare providers of the risks associated with the drug and to guide clinical decision-making such as risk assessment and the use of thromboprophylaxis when prescribing Pomalidomide.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,pomalidomide,,"The drug label for pomalidomide (Pomalyst) provides evidence of an association between pomalidomide treatment and the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
Pomalidomide has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials, and the drug label summarizes adverse reactions from these trials. Venous and arterial thromboembolic events have been reported as a significant concern. Specifically, in Trial 2 (safety population of 450 patients with MM), the drug label notes that 3.0% of patients treated with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone experienced arterial thromboembolic events, which include myocardial infarction. These data suggest that pomalidomide treatment may increase the risk of arterial thromboembolic events, inclusive of AMI.

Warnings and Precautions Section:
The ""Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism"" subsection of the warnings and precautions section explicitly states that myocardial infarion, along with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke, can occur in patients with MM treated with pomalidomide. As a result, antithrombotic prophylaxis is recommended, with the choice of regimen based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors. This recommendation reflects the recognized risk of AMI associated with the use of pomalidomide.

Boxed Warnings:
The ""Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism"" part of the boxed warnings also mentions myocardial infarction as a possible adverse event, emphasizing the significance of this risk.

Postmarketing Experience:
While the postmarketing experience subsection does not specifically mention AMI, it lists a variety of adverse reactions reported during postapproval use of the drug, which implies ongoing surveillance for adverse events, including cardiovascular issues.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials and the label's warning sections support a connection between pomalidomide treatment and an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. Health professionals should consider this risk when prescribing pomalidomide and take preventive measures, such as thromboprophylaxis, to minimize the risk. The recommendation for antithrombotic prophylaxis arises from these identified risks.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,pramipexole,,"Based on the provided drug label information for pramipexole, there is no direct evidence to support the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure during clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions listed in the label include a range of central nervous system-related events, such as somnolence, confusion, and hallucinations, cardiovascular issues such as orthostatic hypotension, impulse control behaviors, and other miscellaneous adverse reactions such as nausea, dizziness, and constipation. Specific cardiac events like cardiac failure are mentioned among the postmarketing experiences, but AMI is not described.

Since AMI is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition, if it had been observed during pramiplexole trials or post-marketing surveillance, it would likely have been explicitly listed as a potential adverse reaction. The absence of mention suggests no known or established evidence linking pramipexole with acute myocardial infarction up to the knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, as with any pharmacotherapy, healthcare providers should monitor patients for any adverse events that deviate from the documented side effects and report them to databases like the FDA's MedWatch to contribute to the safety profile of medications.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,prednisolone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for prednisolone, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a recognized adverse reaction. The cardiovascular adverse reactions mentioned include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in premature infants, but no direct mention of a relationship between AMI and prednisolone use is made.

The label does list several cardiovascular issues such as congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, fluid retention, hypertension, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, and sodium retention, which are related to the Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances section. Although these conditions can be risk factors for acute myocardial infarction, they do not establish a direct causative link between prednisolone and AMI.

Without specific mention in the adverse reactions, warning sections, or clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data provided, we cannot conclusively state that there is a known evidence-based relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the administration of prednisolone.

In the absence of direct evidence linking prednisolone to acute myocardial infarction in the drug label or additional sources such as clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing reports provided for review, it must be concluded that there is no known evidence supporting this specific relationship.

To further investigate this potential relationship, a comprehensive literature search, as well as pharmacovigilance databases, should be consulted for any case reports, cohort studies, or other forms of pharmacoepidemiological data that could shed light on the issue. If you have access to such data or additional sources, I can assist in evaluating those.","The label for prednisolone does not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a known adverse reaction. In the absence of AMI being listed among the cardiovascular adverse reactions in the provided sections of the drug label, one can infer that there has not been a definitive link established between prednisolone use and acute myocardial infarction based on the available clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance that informed the labeling of this drug.

However, it is important to note that the absence of AMI in the drug label does not inherently prove that there is no possible relationship. It may simply mean that current evidence does not show a sufficient or consistent association to include it in the label. Furthermore, corticosteroids like prednisolone can contribute to several risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, such as fluid retention, hypertension, and electrolyte disturbances, which could indirectly increase the risk of cardiovascular events in predisposed individuals.

To conclusively refute a possible adverse reaction such as AMI, more focused epidemiological studies or large-scale post-marketing surveillance data specifically investigating the incidence of AMI in patients taking prednisolone as compared to those who do not would be required. In summary, while there is no direct evidence of a link between prednisolone use and acute myocardial infarction reported in the drug’s label, this does not constitute proof of no possible relationship, and healthcare providers typically monitor for cardiovascular risks when prescribing corticosteroids."
acute myocardial infarction,prednisone,,"After reviewing the provided sections of the drug label listing the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings for prednisone, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse effect of the drug.

While hypertension is listed as a potential adverse effect of prednisone use, and hypertension is a known risk factor for AMI, the drug label does not directly associate prednisone with the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction. However, given that corticosteroids like prednisone can cause fluid retention, electrolyte disturbances, and increases in blood pressure, it is plausible to consider a potential indirect relationship where chronic or severe hypertension resulting from long-term prednisone use could contribute to the risk of myocardial infarction.

Clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data specific to prednisone-induced AMI were not provided. Therefore, to ascertain whether there is a direct causal relationship between prednisone and acute myocardial infarction, a review of the wider scientific literature, including clinical studies and post-marketing reports, would be necessary.

In the absence of explicit evidence or established causality between prednisone use and acute myocardial infarction from the provided drug label information, it is not possible to conclude a definitive relationship. If evidence outside this documentation exists, it would be necessary to examine such studies or clinical reports in detail to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence. As of now, based on the information provided from the drug label alone, there is no known evidence supporting acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to prednisone.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,propafenone,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for propafenaryl hydrochloride tablets, there is no explicit evidence directly linking acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to propafenone use in the reported adverse reactions or clinical trial findings. The label does mention various cardiovascular adverse reactions, but AMI is not among them.

However, the warning sections provide insight into the risks associated with Class IC antiarrhythmics (which include propafenone). The label refers to the results from the CAST trial, which found an increased rate of mortality in patients with arrhythmias post-myocardial infarction when treated with Class IC agents compared to placebo. Although it is not stated that propafenone directly causes AMI, it emphasizes the proarrhythmic risk in patients with structural heart disease, suggesting that such drugs should generally be avoided unless necessary.

Additionally, the label notes that propafenone can cause new or worsened arrhythmias, which includes life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. These proarrhythmic effects could, in theory, predispose patients to conditions that might lead to AMI or other severe cardiovascular events, though this is not specified in the label.

In summary, while there is no direct evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking propafenone to acute myocardial infarction, the drug is associated with proarrhythmic effects in certain populations. This could theoretically increase the risk of severe cardiac events like AMI, especially in patients with structural heart disease, as indicated by the warnings related to the use of Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs. It is essential for healthcare providers to assess the benefit-risk profile of propafenone in individual patients and to remain vigilant for cardiovascular adverse effects during treatment.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,propofol,,"The provided drug label for propofol (Diprivan) includes a range of reported adverse reactions collected from controlled clinical trials and worldwide marketing experience. The label outlines both common events based on clinical trial data, in addition to rarer events derived from publications and post-marketing experiences in over 8 million patients.

With regards to cardiovascular events, the label specifies several probably causally related cardiovascular adverse reactions including bradycardia, arrhythmia, tachycardia nodal, hypertension, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output in different settings such as anesthesia/MAC sedation and ICU sedation for both adult and pediatric patients.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under the section detailing adverse events with incidence less than 1% and where a causal relationship is unknown. This categorization indicates that AMI has been reported in patients treated with propofol; however, the evidence available from the provided data does not establish a clear causal relationship between propofol administration and the occurrence of AMI due to its low incidence and the presence of other confounding factors, such as underlying disease or concurrent therapies that may have contributed to the event.

The lack of a definitive causal link means that while there is awareness of AMI occurring in patients receiving propofol, there is not enough evidence to clearly support that propofol is the direct cause of the AMI. Further research, including detailed case studies and clinical trials, would be needed to establish a more explicit connection between propofol use and AMI.

In summary, based on the information provided in the drug label, there is recognition of the occurrence of AMI in patients exposed to propofol, but it is reported as an event with an incidence of less than 1% and without a definitive causal relationship established. As always, clinicians should monitor for adverse events and consider all potential risks when administering any medication.","Based on the drug label information provided for propofol, myocardial infarction is mentioned under the ""Incidence less than 1% - Causal Relationship Unknown"" section for the cardiovascular category. This implies that instances of myocardial infarction have been reported in patients exposed to propofol; however, the available data do not establish a clear causal relationship between propofol administration and myocardial infarction. 

Since this adverse reaction is not listed among those considered ""Probably Causally Related,"" and given the context that it falls under ""Causal Relationship Unknown,"" there is no definitive evidence supporting or refuting a direct link between propofol exposure and acute myocardial infarction. The mention in this category suggests that despite its occurrence, myocardial infarction is a very rare event and a direct causal relationship has not been established in the context of propofol usage.

However, it's important to note that most adverse events with any drug can be multifactorial, with a combination of drug effects, patient health status, concurrent medications, and underlying conditions potentially contributing to the occurrence of an event like myocardial infarction. Therefore, while there is mention of myocardial infarction in the context of propofol use, without clear evidence of causality, we cannot conclusively refute the relationship either.

To provide a precise and accurate response, further investigation would typically involve examining robust post-marketing surveillance data, case reports, and any available review articles or meta-analyses from the scientific literature focusing on cardiovascular outcomes related to propofol use.

For a complete evaluation of the safety profile of propofol and its associations with specific adverse events like acute myocardial infarction, healthcare professionals would generally turn to the entirety of the available medical and scientific evidence, including post-marketing reports, additional literature, and clinical judgment considering individual patient risk factors."
acute myocardial infarction,propoxyphene,,"Acute myocardial infarction (MI) as an adverse reaction to propoxyphene is mentioned within the post-marketing surveillance section of the drug label you provided. Post-marketing surveillance is a type of observational study that monitors the safety of a drug after it has been released on the market. It is important to note, however, that such reports are often based on voluntary reporting of adverse events, which can be influenced by factors such as media attention and awareness of the drug's potential side effects.

The evidence for acute MI associated with propoxyphene, as detailed on the drug label, does not stem from controlled clinical trials but rather from post-marketing reports. This means that while there have been reports of MI occurring after the use of propoxyphene, the evidence does not come from a preplanned study environment with a comparison group, which is generally needed to establish a cause-effect relationship. 

Since the label mentions myocardial infarction under post-marketing surveillance, this indicates that there have been instances where patients taking propoxyphene experienced MI, but it does not necessarily establish a causal relationship. Adverse events reported post-marketing are not always directly attributable to the drug, as there can be confounding factors such as pre-existing conditions, the use of other medications, and lifestyle choices that could contribute to the development of an MI.

Given that propoxyphene is an opioid analgesic, it's also important to consider the drug's pharmacology and potential for causing cardiovascular stress. Opioids can lead to a range of cardiovascular effects, such as changes in blood pressure and heart rate, which could, in theory, contribute to an increased risk of MI in susceptible individuals, especially when taken in overdose or in combination with other CNS depressants, including alcohol.

Furthermore, the boxed warning and warnings sections highlight the risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and hypotensive effects. While these are not directly related to MI, they do represent significant cardiovascular stressors that could potentially contribute to a cardiac event in certain vulnerable populations.

In summary, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance suggesting a potential association between propoxyphene use and acute myocardial infarction, but this data lacks the rigor of information gleaned from controlled clinical trials. The relationship is not clearly established, and causal conclusions cannot be made solely based on post-marketing reports. More in-depth research would be required to confirm if there is a direct link between propoxyphene use and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,protriptyline,,"The drug label for protriptyline, as provided, includes myocardial infarction as a potential cardiovascular adverse reaction. Protriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is listed with a few adverse reactions that have not necessarily been reported with this specific drug but are considered possible due to pharmacological similarities among tricyclic antidepressants. It mentions that protriptyline is more likely to ""produce cardiovascular reactions such as tachycardia and hypotension.""

Regarding myocardial infarction specifically, the label does not detail the incidence rate from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. Mention of myocardial infarction suggests that there is some level of evidence associating this adverse event with protriptyline use, possibly through case studies, post-marketing surveillance reports, or an understanding of the drug's pharmacodynamics.

Tricyclic antidepressants, including protriptyline, are known to have cardiac effects, such as tachycardia and arrhythmias, which in certain vulnerable populations could predispose patients to myocardial infarction, particularly in those with pre-existing heart disease.

However, without detailed clinical data or specific post-marketing surveillance statistics included in the provided sections, it is not possible to ascertain the strength of the evidence linking protriptyline to acute myocardial infarction. In conclusion, while myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse event, the provided drug label does not offer comprehensive evidence to evaluate the relationship between protriptyline and the occurrence of myocardial infarction. For a definitive statement on this relationship, detailed reports of adverse events, results from further clinical trials, or large-scale observational studies would be necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,prucalopride,,"The drug label provided for prucalopride, marketed as MOTEGRITY, lists various adverse reactions documented during clinical trials, but acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction (affecting ≥2% of patients). The most frequent adverse reactions mentioned include headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal distension, dizziness, vomiting, flatulence, and fatigue.

In the cardiovascular safety analysis section, an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee looked at all potential major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. During the double-blind trials, the incidence rate (IR) for MACE was 3.5 per 1000 patient-years for the prucalopride group, with 1 patient on 2 mg (the recommended dose) and 1 patient on 4 mg experiencing a MACE. There were 2 MACE in the placebo group, resulting in an IR of 5.2 per 1000 patient-years. Combining data from both double-blind and open-label trials, the IR for MACE was 3.3 per 1000 patient-years for MOTEGRITY, indicating that MACE, including myocardial infarction, is a rare adverse event associated with prucalopride.

Furthermore, in a population-based retrospective observational cohort study using European healthcare databases, new users of prucalopride were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 to examine MACE occurrences. The estimated standardized incidence rate ratio did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk for prucalopride users compared to polyethylene glycol users, and the 95% confidence interval excluded a three-fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use.

Post-marketing surveillance has also revealed some reports of adverse reactions in patients taking prucalopride. However, the label explicitly states that because these reactions are reported voluntarily from an uncertain size population, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship.

In summary, the evidence does not suggest a strong relationship between prucalopride use and acute myocardial infarction, given its absence from common adverse reactions and the low incidence rates reported in clinical trials. Nevertheless, the possibility of a rare association exists, as seen in the low incidence of MACE in both double-blind and open-label trial data, though it is less frequent than the placebo group in the double-blind setting. Post-marketing data do not provide additional information specific to the incidence of AMI. Therefore, the relationship between prucalopride and AMI as an adverse reaction is not established as a common occurrence based on the evidence provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data outlined in the drug label.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,quinapril,,"Based on the drug label information provided, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned as a potential adverse reaction to quinapril, although it is grouped under the less frequent, clinically significant events seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The events listed in italics, which includes myocardial infarction, suggest that these occurrences were rarer compared to other side effects.

Here’s a summary of the evidence referring to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to quinapril from the drug label sections provided:

Clinical Trials: The drug label mentions myocardial infarction only under the less frequent, clinically significant events observed during clinical trials or in post-marketing experience. However, specific data or incidence rates for myocardial infarction in the clinical trial participants are not provided. Thus, while myocardial infarction is listed as an event, the direct evidence from clinical trials is not detailed in the information given.

Post-marketing Surveillance: The reference to myocardial infarction within the context of post-marketing experience suggests that the relationship between quinapril and acute myocardial infarction has been observed with the use of the drug in broader patient populations outside of clinical trials. These observations would have likely been reported through adverse event reporting systems. However, specific data, such as the frequency of reports or the existence of a causal relationship, are not provided in the label excerpts you have presented.

No specific case studies are mentioned in the provided details, so it is not possible to comment on case studies as a source of evidence within the scope of the information given.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is listed as a potential adverse reaction to quinapril in the label, the exact nature and strength of the evidence supporting this relationship, based on clinical trials or quantitative data from post-marketing surveillance, are not explicitly detailed in the sections of the drug label provided. It is important to consult more detailed sources, such as peer-reviewed studies, specific clinical trial data, and comprehensive post-marketing reports, to better understand the strength of the evidence regarding this potential adverse reaction.","Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for quinapril, there is no explicit evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure listed in the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings. However, myocardial infarction is included in the list of less frequent, clinically significant events seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience, suggesting that there have been rare reports of this event in patients using quinapril. 

While the inclusion of AMI on this list does not establish causality, it implies that such an event has occurred in patients taking the drug but does not necessarily mean that the drug caused the event. The ‘clinically significant events’ list may include adverse events that are collected during the drug's use without clear evidence of a direct link to the drug. Often, these lists are based on spontaneous reports which cannot establish causality.

To definitively refute the relationship between AMI and quinapril, comprehensive studies or meta-analyses comparing the incidence of AMI in patients taking quinapril with control groups not taking the drug (and accounting for other risk factors for AMI) would be necessary. Without such studies being referenced in the drug label, we cannot conclusively state that there is evidence refuting the relationship between AMI and quinapril exposure."
acute myocardial infarction,rasagiline,,"Based on the provided information from the drug label, there is no direct evidence indicating that acute myocardial infarction is a recognized adverse reaction of rasagiline from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions prominently discussed in the drug label include hypertension, serotonin syndrome, somnolence and falling asleep during daily activities, orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior, impulse control and compulsive behaviors, and withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion.

In the clinical trials detailed (Studies 1, 2, and 3), various adverse reactions are listed under sections 6.1 and 6.2, such as flu syndrome, arthralgia, depression, dyspepsia, peripheral edema, nausea, etc. Additionally, the warnings and precautions section (5) discusses other potential side effects related to blood pressure regulation (hypertension and orthostatic hypotension), mental status and behavior changes, and serotonin syndrome but does not mention acute myocardial infarction.

Therefore, based on the section labels provided, it can be stated explicitly that acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an observed adverse reaction from the clinical development of rasagiline, including the monotherapy use and adjunct use with levodopa or other Parkinson's disease treatments. Post-marketing experience, as detailed in section 6.2, also does not mention acute myocardial infarction as an identified adverse reaction during postapproval use of rasagiline.

It is critical for healthcare professionals to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities, such as the FDA MedWatch program, and for pharmaceutical companies to continuously monitor the safety profile of their products post-marketing. If new information arises linking rasagiline to acute myocardial infarction, it would be appropriate to reassess and update the drug label accordingly.","Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for rasagiline, there is no evidence presented to suggest that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an adverse reaction associated with the drug. The adverse reactions described in the clinical trials experience (6.1), as well as those identified during postmarketing experience (6.2), do not include AMI. The sections provided focus on a range of different adverse reactions and warnings, such as hypertension, serotonin syndrome, and various other possible side effects. However, there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction as an observed outcome of rasagiline exposure in either the controlled trials or post-marketing data. 

Given that the provided label sections do not list acute myocardial infarction as a known or suspected adverse reaction to rasagiline, and assuming that the provided sections are complete and up-to-date, there appears to be no evidence to support a relationship between AMI and rasagiline use up to the knowledge cutoff date. If you have additional data or suspect a link based on new information, it would be important to report this to the appropriate pharmacovigilance and regulatory authorities for further investigation."
acute myocardial infarction,regorafenib,,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to regorafenib is outlined in the drug's label sections regarding adverse reactions and warnings.

Clinical Trials:
In the sections detailing the clinical trials experience (6.1), myocardial infarction is reported as an adverse reaction in less than 10% of STIVARGA-treated patients in these trials. Specifically, within the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) trial (RESORCE), myocardial infarction occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with regorafenib. Additionally, cardiac ischemia and infarction are noted under Warnings and Precautions (5.7), indicating an increased incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction in regorafenib-treated patients compared to placebo (0.9% vs 0.2%) across placebo-controlled trials. The label advises withholding regorafenib in patients who develop new or acute onset cardiac ischemia or infarction.

Post-Marketing Experience:
The label also mentions (6.2) that myocardial ischemia has been reported in patients taking regorafenib post-marketing, although due to the nature of voluntary reporting and uncertain population size, establishing a firm causal relationship is challenging. 

There is a warning (5.7) indicating an increased incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction in patients treated with regorafenib as compared to placebo in randomized, controlled trials.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicating that acute myocardial infarction can occur as an adverse reaction to regorafenib, although it appears to be infrequent. It is emphasized that patients be monitored for cardiac events, and regorafenib treatment should be modified or discontinued if necessary.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,regorafenib,,"Evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggests that there is a potential relationship between regorafenib exposure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. 

Specific evidence supporting this relationship includes:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- In the clinical trial data summarized in the adverse reactions section of the drug label (particularly the RESORCE study), myocardial infarction was reported as an adverse reaction in less than 10% of patients treated with regorafenib. Specifically, the incidence rate of myocardial infarction was given as 0.3%.
- In section 5.7 ""Cardiac Ischemia and Infarction"" under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, myocardial ischemia and infarction were indeed noted as being more frequent in regorafenib-treated patients (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.2%) during randomized placebo-controlled trials.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
- Post-marketing surveillance has also identified myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. However, because these reports are based on voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size, it is difficult to determine their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

While the observed incidence of acute myocardial infarction in patients using regorafenib is low, the inclusion of myocardial ischemia and infarction in both the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section and as an adverse reaction in the RESORCE study, coupled with post-marketing reports, provides evidence for a possible relationship between regorafenib and the occurrence of AMI. Healthcare providers should be aware of this risk and monitor patients accordingly, especially considering the severe nature of such an event.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,relugolix,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for relugolix (brand name ORGOVYX), there is evidence of an association between acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and exposure to the drug. This evidence comes from the HERO clinical trial, which is described in Section 6.1 of the label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (from HERO study): Serious adverse reactions that occurred in at least 0.5% of patients treated with relugolix included myocardial infarction (0.8%). Additionally, fatal adverse reactions due to myocardial infarction were documented in 0.3% of patients receiving relugolix. Furthermore, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke were collectively reported in 2.7% of patients treated with the drug.

2. Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials: The HERO clinical trial provides evidence of the incidence of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in patients taking relugolix for advanced prostate cancer. While myocardial infarction was not listed in the most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥10% of patients), it was serious enough to be included in the section detailing significant adverse events experienced by patients during the study.

3. Post-Marketing Experience: Although myocardial infarction is not explicitly mentioned in the drug label's section 6.2 on post-marketing experience, this section indicates that other adverse reactions have been identified since the drug was approved and made available to a broader population.

The drug label does not mention any Boxed Warnings related to cardiac events for relugolix. However, healthcare providers are advised to report suspected adverse reactions to the FDA, which contributes to post-marketing surveillance and provides ongoing monitoring of the drug's safety profile.

In summary, the identified evidence supporting acute myocardial infarction as a potential adverse reaction to relugolix includes data from clinical trial experience, specifically the HERO study, where myocardial infarction was documented as a serious adverse event in a small percentage of patients. No additional information from case studies or other post-marketing surveillance data was explicitly provided in the label sections reviewed.","Based on the provided drug label sections for ORGOVYX (relugolix), there is evidence suggesting an association between the use of relugolix and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Specifically, the Clinical Trials Experience section (6.1) states that serious adverse reactions in patients receiving ORGOVYX included myocardial infarction, with an incidence of 0.8%. Additionally, it mentions that fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving ORGOVYX, including myocardial infarction (0.3%). Furthermore, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke were reported in 2.7% of patients receiving the drug.

The evidence, therefore, does not refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to relugolix but instead indicates that there is a potential risk of AMI as an adverse reaction to the medication.

Therefore, given this context, the response is ""NA,"" as there is documented evidence of acute myocardial infarction occurring in patients taking ORGOVYX, and this information is directly cited from the drug's label under Clinical Trials Experience."
acute myocardial infarction,repaglinide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure to repaglinide is based on adverse reaction data obtained from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences.

Clinical Trials Experience:
Repaglinide has been administered to a large number of individuals in clinical trials. Across controlled trials comparing repaglinide to other sulfonylureas, a higher incidence of serious cardiovascular events, including ischemia, was noted for repaglinide (4%) than for the comparator sulfonylurea drugs (3%). Specific to cardiac ischemic events, the reported incidence was similar for both repaglinide-treated patients and those on sulfonylureas (2%). Deaths due to cardiovascular events were slightly higher in the repaglinide group (0.5%) compared to the sulfonylurea group (0.4%). Moreover, in combination therapies involving repaglinide, such as with NPH-insulin, there were six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia reported out of 431 patients from two studies.

Postmarketing Experience:
Post-marketing surveillance is an important tool for understanding drug safety. Although such reports are voluntary and the frequency of adverse reactions cannot be reliably estimated, they can raise flags about potential drug-related risks. For repaglinide, the available post-marketing reports do not specifically mention acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction, thus making it difficult to establish a definitive causal relationship based exclusively on post-marketing data.

Serious Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions with Concomitant NPH-insulin:
Additionally, a warning is present on the label indicating serious cardiovascular adverse reactions, including myocardial ischemia, when repaglinide is used with NPH-insulin. It is important to note that repaglinide is not indicated for use in combination with NPH-insulin. This is based on seven controlled trials where the said events were reported.

Macrovascular Outcomes:
The label for repaglinide also states that no clinical studies have conclusively established a macrovascular risk reduction with repaglinide.

Conclusion:
In summary, evidence from controlled clinical trials suggests a relationship between repaglinide and an increased incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including myocardial ischemia, when compared to other sulfonylureas or during concomitant treatment with NPH-insulin. However, no explicit evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data has been found that clearly establishes acute myocardial infarction as a direct adverse reaction to repaglinide monotherapy.

It is essential to interpret these findings with caution, considering the complexity of cardiovascular disease and the potential influence of confounding factors such as patients' underlying health conditions, concurrent medications, and variations in trial designs. Healthcare providers should consider the benefits and risks of repaglinide, especially in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors.","Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence to support a relationship between repaglinide and serious cardiovascular adverse events, including myocardial ischemia, especially when used in combination with NPH-insulin. The label mentions that across seven controlled clinical trials, six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia were reported in patients treated with repaglinide plus NPH-insulin from two studies. However, these trials do not show an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction specifically due to repaglinide monotherapy.

The section ""Cardiovascular Events"" within the label details that the incidence of total serious cardiovascular adverse events, including ischemia, was 4% for repaglinide versus 3% for sulfonylurea drugs in controlled comparator clinical trials. Cardiac ischemic events were reported similarly for both repaglinide and sulfonylurea drugs (2% each). Deaths due to cardiovascular events were 0.5% with repaglinide and 0.4% with sulfonylureas.

The data provided on the incidence rates of adverse cardiovascular events do not specifically refute the possibility of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to repaglinide, but they do not establish a greater risk associated with repaglinide compared to other sulfonylureas either.

While the drug label mentions myocardial ischemia, it does not explicitly state that acute myocardial infarction is a common or statistically significant adverse reaction directly attributable to repaglinide. Thus, while there is no concrete evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and repaglinide, the evidence does not clearly establish this as a direct adverse effect of the drug either.

In conclusion, since acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a common adverse reaction to repaglinide in the provided drug label and there is no clear evidence establishing repaglinide as a direct cause, we do not have definitive evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure. However, it is important to consider the broader cardiovascular risks as indicated. More detailed studies would be required to specifically address the potential relationship between repaglinide and acute myocardial infarction."
acute myocardial infarction,rituximab,,"After reviewing the provided sections of the drug label for rituximab, there is reference to cardiovascular adverse reactions associated with its use. Specifically, the drug label under ""5.7 Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions"" notes that cardiac adverse reactions, including ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction (acute myocardial infarction), and cardiogenic shock may occur in patients receiving rituximab products. Patients are instructed to be closely monitored during and after all infusions of rituximab for those who develop clinically significant arrhythmias or have a history of arrhythmia or angina.

Additionally, within ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"", the label further details cardiovascular system adverse reactions, reporting that hypertension and hypotension were observed in clinical trials, but it does not provide specific incidence rates for acute myocardial infarction in these contexts. It mentions that in NHL Study 8, a review of cardiac toxicity determined that supraventricular arrhythmias or tachycardia accounted for most of the difference in cardiac disorders between rituximab and control arms (4.5% for R-CHOP vs. 1.0% for CHOP alone). Although it indicates an increased overall risk of cardiac disorders, it does not isolate acute myocardial infarction.

From the Postmarketing Experience section (""6.3""), there is acknowledgment that cardiac failure, which can be a consequence of an acute myocardial infarction or a stand-alone event, has been reported as a fatal outcome.

In sum, while the drug label suggests that cardiovascular adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction can occur with rituximab use, detailed incidence rates or specific data on acute myocardial infarction from clinical trials are not provided. The label warns about the potential for serious cardiac events and advises monitoring and discontinuation of the drug if a serious or life-threatening cardiac event occurs. Evidence of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to rituximab exposure primarily comes from the summary of post-marketing experiences, which are voluntary reports and lack a clear incidence rate established through controlled trials.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,rivastigmine,,"Evidence Summary for Acute Myocardial Infarction as an Adverse Reaction of Rivastigmine:

After a thorough review of the provided sections of the drug label for rivastigmine (Sections 6 Adverse Reactions, the Warnings and Precautions, and Postmarketing Experience), there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction resulting from the administration of rivastigmine.

Clinical Trials Experience:
- In the clinical trials cited, the common adverse reactions associated with rivastigmine were related to its cholinergic effects, including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia.
- Adverse reactions that led to the discontinuation of the drug were predominantly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting.
- Cardiovascular disorders listed pertain to hypertension and syncope, but no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction is provided.

Postmarketing Experience:
- Adverse reactions reported postmarketing are voluntary, and while they include cardiac disorders such as tachycardia, there is no specific report of acute myocardial infarction associated with rivastigmine.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The section on Cardiac Conduction Effects mentions that rivastigmine could have vagotonic effects on heart rate, such as bradycardia, but there is no direct assertion linking it to AMI.
- Syncope episodes were reported, but these are not equated to or indicative of myocardial infarction.

Based on the details provided in the drug label, there is no available evidence within the clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, or listed warnings that directly associates rivastigmine with acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. If this information is to be updated or if further research is conducted outside of these reported sources, additional details may emerge that could change this conclusion. However, as of the provided information, there is no indication that AMI is a known adverse effect of rivastigmine.","There is no evidence provided in the adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings sections of the drug label for rivastigmine that directly refutes the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the drug. The cardiovascular-related information mentions bradycardia as a potential vagotonic effect, and syncopal episodes are reported, but there is no mention of acute myocardial infarction as an observed adverse reaction in the provided sections.

The absence of acute myocardial infarction in the adverse reactions and the descriptions of the clinical trial experiences suggest that during the clinical trials and post-marketing experience, this specific adverse event was not a commonly reported or identified risk associated with the use of rivastigmine. However, the absence of such reports in these sections does not conclusively refute the possibility. To fully refute the relationship, one would expect to see evidence from robust epidemiological studies or meta-analyses specifically investigating the link between rivastilegmine and acute myocardial infarction, which are not included here. Therefore, based on the provided drug label information, no evidence is available within the text that refutes the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and rivastigmine."
acute myocardial infarction,rizatriptan,1.0,"The relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the exposure to rizatriptan is suggested by various types of evidence as outlined in the drug's labeling. Here is a summary of the evidence:

1. Clinical Trial Data:
Clinical trials have included over 3700 adult patients receiving rizatriptan. While common adverse reactions seen at a ≥5% incidence and greater than placebo included asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation, and dizziness, AMI was not reported as a common adverse reaction during these trials. However, less common adverse effects can still occur and might not be identified unless post-marketing surveillance provides such data.

2. Postmarketing Surveillance:
The labeling states that there have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan. These incidences are derived from spontaneous reports in a postmarketing context. Due to the nature of these reports, frequency and causal relationship to rizatriptan are not reliably determinable, but the association has been recognized in the medication's labeling.

3. Warnings & Precautions:
The labeling specifically warns about the potential risk of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina associated with rizatriptan usage. It notes that these events have been reported and advises against the use of rizatriptan in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. The label advises a cardiac evaluation before prescribing rizatriptan to patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and suggests a medically supervised environment for the initial dose.

4. Mechanistic Plausibility:
There is a mechanistic rationale for the adverse reaction as 5-HT1 agonists, like rizatriptan, may cause coronary artery vasospasm. This could precipitate myocardial ischemia or infarction, particularly in patients who have underlying coronary artery disease or those with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is not reported as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials of rizatriptan, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance and the drug's mechanism of action that establishes a possible link between rizatriptan usage and AMI. These concerns are significant enough to be described in the warnings and precautions section of the drug's label, suggesting clinicians be cautious and evaluate for risk factors of coronary artery disease before prescribing rizatriptan.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,romosozumab,,"**Evidence Summary for Association Between Acute Myocardial Infarction and Romosozumab (EVENITY)**

Evidence from clinical trials has indicated a potential association between the use of romosozumab (EVENITY) and an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), which include myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular death.

**Clinical Trials**:
1. Study 1 (PLACEBO-CONTROLLED):
   - A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 7,180 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis assessed the safety of EVENITY (NCT01575834).
   - Incidence of MI was comparable between EVENITY and placebo groups (9 (0.3%) in the EVENITY vs. 8 (0.2%) in placebo).
   - The hazard ratio for MACE in the EVENITY group compared to placebo was 1.03 (95% CI [0.62, 1.72]), indicating no significant difference.

2. Study 2 (ALENDRONATE-CONTROLLED):
   - Another multicenter, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled trial (NCT01631214) involving 4,093 postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture compared the safety of EVENITY with alendronate.
   - Incidence of MI was higher in the EVENITY group compared to the alendronate group (16 (0.8%) vs. 5 (0.2%)).
   - The hazard ratio for MACE was 1.87 (95% CI [1.11, 3.14]) for EVENITY versus alendronate, which indicates a significantly higher risk associated with EVENITY.

A Boxed Warning is included in the label, highlighting the potential increased risk of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death with EVENITY, and advises against initiation in patients who have had a MI or stroke within the preceding year. It recommends carefully weighing the benefits and risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors and discontinuing EVENITY if an MI or stroke occurs during treatment.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance**:
Specific post-marketing surveillance data regarding acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to romosozumab is not cited in the provided label information. Post-marketing surveillance typically involves monitoring the safety of a drug after it has been released on the market, which can reveal adverse events not seen in clinical trials.

Based on the evidence from the clinical trials, there is a documented risk of increased MI, particularly when comparing EVENITY to alendronate. Healthcare professionals are advised to exercise caution and consider the cardiovascular risk profile of patients before and during treatment with EVENITY.","The evidence provided indicates a relationship between romosozumab (EVENITY) and an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), as well as other major adverse cardiac events (MACE) such as stroke and cardiovascular death. This association is specifically mentioned in the boxed warning and the warnings and precautions sections of the drug label.

Clinical trial data from Study 2 (NCT01631214) showed that the number of women with positively adjudicated MACE was higher in the romosozumab group compared to the alendronate group (41 [2.0%] vs. 22 [1.1%]), with a hazard ratio of 1.87 (95% CI [1.11, 3.14]). This suggests a nearly doubled risk of MACE for patients on romosozumab compared to those on alendronate.

Given that the evidence from clinical trials supports an increased risk of MI associated with romosozumab use, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction and drug exposure to romosozumab. The protocol for generating the summary asked to explicitly state ""NA"" if no refuting evidence exists, and based on the information provided, this is the appropriate response: NA."
acute myocardial infarction,ropinirole,,"The provided drug label information for ropinirole, a medication primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), does not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a known adverse reaction either in the ""Adverse Reactions"" section or within the ""Postmarketing Experience"". The adverse reactions described include various cardiovascular events such as syncope, hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension), and hypertension, but AMI is not mentioned explicitly amidst these or other cardiovascular-related adverse reactions.

The clinical trials experience outlined for both early and advanced stages of PD, as well as for RLS, details the most commonly observed adverse reactions, which include symptoms like nausea, somnolence, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and dyskinesia. Although cardiovascular events such as palpitation, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation are noted, AMI is not included in these observations.

It is also notable that the sections ""Warnings and Precautions"" and ""Postmarketing Experience"" do not address AMI as a concern. The latter section underlines that postmarketing observations can be of uncertain frequency and causality due to the voluntary nature of reports, but the report does not include AMI as an identified adverse reaction.

Therefore, based on the available information from the provided sections of the drug label, there is no direct evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and exposure to ropinirole in the context of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance.

For an extensive evaluation on the link between AMI and ropinirole, one would have to explore further sources such as additional post-marketing data, pharmacovigilance databases, or published case reports. As such evidence is not included in the provided label sections, the relationship cannot be substantiated from this information alone. If there have been developments in research or case reports identifying AMI as an adverse reaction following the knowledge cutoff, that information would be necessary to establish a potential link between AMphetamine exposure and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,ropivacaine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ropivacaine, which is an amide-type local anesthetic, there is evidence that suggests acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can occur as an adverse reaction, though it appears to be a rare event. The evidence for this association comes from the clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance as described in the label.

In the section ""Incidence < 1%,"" myocardial infarction is explicitly listed as a relevant adverse event that occurred during the ropivacaine clinical program, suggesting that more than one patient out of the 3,988 exposed to ropivacaine experienced a myocardial infarction. However, the specific incidence rate is not provided. It falls within the category of ""less than 1%,"" which indicates that while the reaction is very uncommon, it has been documented.

The label also categorizes myocardial infarction under the subsection ""Myo/Endo/Pericardium,"" which lists the cardiovascular adverse events that have been observed in patients during clinical programs with ropivacaine.

Further to the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, additional mechanisms are described in the warnings and precautions sections. These include systemic reactions to high doses or accidental intravascular injection resulting in high plasma levels, which can lead to myocardial depression and potentially result in myocardial infarction.

To summarize:

1. Clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance have indicated that myocardial infarction is a potential adverse event in patients exposed to ropivacaine (Incidence < 1% section).

2. Myocardial infarction is specifically listed in the ropivacaine label under cardiovascular adverse events.

3. High plasma levels of ropivacaine due to overdose, rapid absorption, or accidental intravascular injection may affect the cardiovascular system and can potentially lead to AMI (Systemic and Cardiovascular System Reactions sections).

Given that myocardial infarction is an extremely serious medical condition, the inclusion of this adverse event on the label, even though it is rare, is an important consideration for healthcare professionals administering ropivacaine. They must be aware of the signs and symptoms of high local anesthetic systemic toxicity and manage these events quickly and effectively.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,salmon calcitonin,,"The provided drug label sections for salmon calcitonin (a medication primarily used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis) do not list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance.

In the adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS), serious adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, hypocalcemia, and certain nasal adverse reactions are mentioned along with malignancy concerns. The most common reactions reported in clinical trials (over 3%) included rhinitis, symptoms of the nose, back pain, arthralgia, and headache. Malignancy was also discussed based on a meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials, which suggested an increased risk of malignancies in patients treated with calcitonin salmon compared to placebo, particularly when excluding basal cell carcinoma. 

In the post-marketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), various adverse reactions have been reported, such as allergic reactions, hypocalcemia with paresthesia, cardiovascular issues like hypertension and syncope, and chest pain. However, acute myocardial infarction is not specifically cited.

The absence of AMI in these sections suggests that there is no established evidence directly linking salmon calcitonin to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction based on the data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance, as of the knowledge reflected in the drug labeling information provided.

In consideration of all the information presented in the drug label, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the exposure to salmon calcitonin. Any such association would necessitate further investigation, and should such evidence emerge, it would prompt an update to the drug labeling to reflect the newly identified risk.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,sapropterin,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is no direct evidence within the listed clinical trial data or post-marketing experience explicitly linking acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction to the use of sapropterin. The clinical trials mentioned in the drug label report the most common adverse reactions as headache, rhinorrhea, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and nasal congestion, none of which include acute myocardial infarction.

However, in the section detailing the ""Safety Experience from Clinical Studies for Non-PKU Indications,"" myocardial infarction is listed as a serious and severe adverse reaction observed during sapropterin administration. This information suggests that there might be cases or studies, not detailed in the label, where patients experienced an acute myocardial infarction while taking sapropterin. It's important to note that these reactions were listed regardless of causality, which means that it is uncertain whether the drug directly caused the myocardial infarctions observed.

The post-marketing experience section does not include acute myocardial infarction as a reported adverse reaction. This section relies on voluntary reporting, which can be inconsistent, and it's acknowledged that it may not always be possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure due to the uncertain size and representativeness of the reporting population.

In conclusion, the evidence for a causal relationship between sapropterin and acute myocardial infarction is not clearly established in the provided drug label information. There is a mention of myocardial infarction as a serious and severe adverse reaction in non-PKU indications, but without detailed context or evidence of causality. There is no mention of acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction in the listed clinical trials or in the post-marketing experience. Further investigation, such as review of published case reports or larger epidemiological studies, would be necessary to definitively determine the relationship between sapropterin and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,sertraline,,"Based on the sections provided from the drug label, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction specifically associated with sertraline treatment in either the clinical trials section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) or post-marketing experience section (6.2 Post-marketing Experience).

The adverse reactions and cardiac disorders documented in sections 6.1 and 6.2 include palpitations, increased coagulation times (altered platelet function), and a few reports related to QTc-interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia (including Torsade de Pointes). However, it's important to note that QTc prolongation and Torsade de Pointes could potentially lead to serious cardiovascular outcomes, including AMI, if they result in significant arrhythmias.

The clinical trials section does not mention AMI as an observed adverse reaction among the 3066 adults treated with sertraline. Common side effects in clinical trials were nausea, diarrhea/loose stool, tremor, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, ejaculation failure, and decreased libido, among others.

In the post-marketing section, sertraline has been associated with some cardiac disorders, such as atrioventricular (AV) block, bradycardia, atrial arrhythmias, and ventricular tachycardia, but AMI is not listed as a reported adverse reaction.

In summary, based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no direct evidence linking sertraline with acute myocardial infarction either from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance as reported by the FDA. Should there be a concern based on other non-cited literature, detailed review of the literature and case reports would be necessary to establish a potential causal relationship. 

Always consult additional medical literature and adverse event reporting systems for the most up-to-date information, and discuss any medication concerns with a healthcare provider.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,sildenafil,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sildenafil exposure is primarily based on post-marketing experience, as detailed in the drug label section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience. According to this section, there have been reports of serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, in temporal association with the use of sildenafil citrate. It is important to note that many of the reported patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.

The clinical trials described in section 6.1 do not list acute myocardial infarction as a common adverse reaction observed during the studies. The adverse reactions that were reported in ≥2% of patients treated with sildenafil in the clinical trials typically included headache, flushing, dyspeisia, abnormal vision, nasal congestion, back pain, myalgia, nausea, dizziness, and rash.

However, section 5.1 Cardiovascular of the Warnings and Precautions addresses the potential risk of sexual activity in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and the associated risk that treatments for erectile dysfunction might pose. It highlights that sildenafil citrate has systemic vasodilatory properties that can result in transient decreases in blood pressure, which could negatively impact patients with cardiovascular issues, particularly during sexual activity.

Moreover, there is a cautionary note that sildenafil citrate should be used with care in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months or have other serious cardiovascular conditions.

In summary, the causal relationship between sildenafil exposure and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarctions is not firmly established through clinical trials but is suggested by post-marketing reports, particularly in patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions. These reports, however, should be interpreted cautiously as the patients were often predisposed to cardiovascular events and it is not entirely clear whether the AMI was directly related to the medication, to sexual activity, to underlying disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,simvastatin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for simvastatin, there is no direct evidence in the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking simvastatin to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction.

The clinical trials experience (section 6.1) and postmarketing experience (section 6.2) of the drug label do not list acute myocardial infarction among the adverse reactions observed in patients exposed to simvastatin. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies included upper respiratory infections, headache, abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, which could theoretically lead to secondary complications such as acute renal failure, are listed as potential serious adverse reactions, and these conditions are associated with high-dose statin therapy or particular patient risk factors.

In the cardiovascular outcomes study mentioned (the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [Study 4S]) and in another study of patients with a history of myocardial infarction, the adverse effects reported and greater than placebo do not include AMI. Instead, these focus on myopathy (muscle weakness or pain with increased creatinine kinase) and rhabdomyolysis (more severe myopathy with very high creatinine kinase levels) (section 5.1).

It's important to mention that simvastatin, like other statins, is often prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, in patients with hypercholesterolemia or established coronary heart disease. Therefore, the occurrence of an AMI in a patient taking simvastatin may be more related to the underlying cardiovascular risk rather than being a direct adverse reaction to the drug itself.

In conclusion, according to the provided sections of the simvastatin drug label, there is no reported evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that establishes a causal relationship between simvastatin use and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,siponimod,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and siponimod (marketed as Mayzent) comes primarily from clinical trials, as there is no box warning or specified adverse reaction in the label sections provided that directly connects siponimod with acute myocardial infarction. However, the clinical trials section (6.1) mentions vascular events, including myocardial infarctions, reported in 3.0% of siponimod-treated patients compared to 2.6% of patients receiving placebo during Study 1. Some of these events were fatal. This data suggests a potential association between siponimod treatment and myocardial infarction, albeit with a small difference in occurrence between the treated and placebo groups.

Additionally, section 5.4 states that siponimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and should be used cautiously in patients with cardiovascular issues, including a history of myocardial infarction. While this does not directly establish acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction, it implies the need for careful consideration in patients with a history of heart problems due to the pharmacodynamics of the drug.

Post-marketing experience (section 6.2) does not list myocardial infarction as an identified adverse reaction during the post-approval use of Mayzent. The absence of this condition in the post-marketing data could indicate that the incidence is not significantly higher than what was observed in clinical trials or that more evidence is needed to establish a clear relationship.

In summary, the evidence pointing to acute myocardial infarction as a potential adverse reaction to siponimod is primarily based on a slight increase in vascular events (which includes myocardial infarction) in clinical trial data. The difference between the treatment and placebo groups is small, and there is no substantial evidence from post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking siponimod to acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, while there is a potential signal from the clinical trial, further data would be necessary to definitively establish acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to siponimod.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,sodium ferric gluconate complex,,"Analysis of the provided drug label sections for sodium ferric gluconate complex suggests that the medication is associated with a range of adverse reactions, including cardiovascular events. Specifically, under the ""Cardiovascular System"" subheading in the ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" and ""Postmarketing Experience"" sections, myocardial infarction is noted.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- Studies A and B, which included a total of 126 adult patients, listed myocardial infarction as a treatment-emergent adverse reaction, although the rate was not specified. This indicates that during the clinical trials, at least some instances of myocardial infarction were observed.

Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:
- The ""Postmarketing Experience"" section explicitly mentions acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction in the context of a hypersensitivity reaction as an identified adverse reaction in the period after the drug had been approved and was in broader usage.

It’s important to note that the evidence from clinical trials is limited to the observed adverse reactions during the studies, which may have limited follow-up periods and smaller patient populations, potentially not capturing all possible adverse events. In the post-marketing phase, adverse reactions are generally reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and while this can include a broader patient population, it is subject to underreporting and may not establish a causal relationship to drug exposure conclusively.

In summary, while myocardial infarction is not one of the most commonly reported adverse reactions, there is evidence both from clinical trial experiences and post-marketing reports that suggests a relationship between myocardial infarction and the administration of sodium ferric gluconate complex. This evidence includes specific mention of myocardial infarction in the clinical trial adverse events summary and the reports of acute myocardial ischemia and infarction post-marketing. However, due to the nature of this data, a definitive causal relationship cannot be established without further investigation.","Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned as an adverse reaction that has been identified in association with the use of sodium ferric gluconate complex (SFGC) in sucrose injection, specifically within the context of a hypersensitivity reaction or postmarketing spontaneous reports. It appears in the Cardiovascular System subsection of Postmarketing Experience as ""acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction or with in-stent thrombosis in the context of a hypersensitivity reaction.""

However, there are no specific details indicating that SFGC directly causes AMI independent of a hypersensitivity reaction. The mention of AMI in the context of hypersensitivity suggests a potential mechanism in which an adverse reaction might trigger a cascade of events leading to ischemia or infarction. Furthermore, this adverse event would be considered relatively rare given that it comes from postmarketing surveillance data, representing a broader but less controlled dataset compared to the controlled environment of clinical trials.

It is worth noting that the provided drug label sections do not include a definitive statement refuting the relationship between AMI and SFGC use; instead, they suggest an association within specific circumstances (hypersensitivity reactions). However, a causal relationship cannot be established solely based on this data.

In conclusion, to refute a relationship between AMI and SFGC directly, one would need robust evidence from controlled clinical studies explicitly examining this potential adverse reaction and showing a lack of association or causality. This does not appear to be present in the information provided. Therefore, the provided drug label information does not contain evidence that explicitly refutes the relationship between AMI as an adverse reaction to SFGC in the absence of hypersensitivity reactions. Further investigation and research would be required to clarify the relationship."
acute myocardial infarction,sodium tetradecyl sulfate,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol), there is mention of cerebrovascular accidents and myocardial infarction as adverse reactions, but specific details regarding the evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the drug exposure are not provided in the text excerpt.

The adverse reactions section indicates a range of possible local and systemic effects, including allergic reactions, and mentions at least six deaths, including cases of anaphylactic shock and a fatal pulmonary embolism. However, there is no explicit detail on the frequency, clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that documents acute myocardial infarction as a directly correlated adverse effect of using sodium tetradecyl sulfate.

To provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence, it is necessary to consult the full clinical trial data, any published case studies, and the post-marketing surveillance reports that would reveal the incidence rate and provide a more precise understanding of the relationship between the drug and acute myocardial infarction. In the absence of these details, it cannot be conclusively stated that there is robust evidence supporting acute myocardial infarction as a common or well-documented adverse reaction to sodium tetradecyl sulfate. 

In conclusion, the provided drug label information suggests that myocardial infarction has been reported as an adverse reaction to sodium tetradecyl sulfate, but without access to more detailed data, we cannot assess the strength of the evidence or the probable causal relationship. For a definitive statement on the matter, additional investigation into clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance data would be required. If you have access to such data sources or if further research into those areas can be conducted, a more thorough evaluation could be performed.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,sumatriptan,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between a potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the exposure to sumatriptan, a medication commonly used for the treatment of migraine, can be found in multiple sections of the drug’s prescribing information.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The clinical trials section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) mentions chest pain, which could be indicative of cardiac events like AMI, as a common adverse reaction in patients treated with sumatriptan (under the brand name IMITREX). They report chest pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness with the following prevalence: 12% for the 25 mg dose, 21% for the 50 mg dose, and unlisted for the 100 mg dose.

Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence:
In the postmarketing experience section (6.2), the document highlights that serious cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, have been reported following the administration of IMITREX. While these reports are voluntary and the exact frequency cannot be established, the data indicate that such serious events have occurred.

Warnings and Precautions:
The warnings and precautions section (5.1) explicitly mentions that there have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, occurring within a few hours following the administration of IMITREX tablets. Some of these adverse reactions happened in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). The document states that sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), which could lead to ischemic events such as AMI, even in individuals without CAD.

Given the evidence from clinical trials, postmarketing reports, and direct warnings from the prescribing information, it can be concluded that there is a relationship between sumatriptan exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction, particularly in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors or with unrecognized coronary artery disease. Healthcare providers are advised to perform cardiac evaluations in at-risk patients and consider the first dose in a medically supervised setting, with continuous monitoring for any signs of adverse cardiac events.","NA

The information provided in the drug label sections does not refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to sumatriptan. Instead, it acknowledges myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina as potential adverse reactions, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or with a history of coronary artery disease. Therefore, there is no evidence provided here that would disprove a causal relationship between sumatriptan and acute myocardial infarction."
acute myocardial infarction,tadalafil,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials of tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials with a higher incidence in the tadalafil group compared to placebo included headache, myalgia, nasopharyngitis, flushing, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, pain in extremity, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion.

However, the section on postmarketing experience mentions that serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, have been reported in temporal association with the use of tadalafil during post-approval use. It is important to note that these reports are based on voluntary submissions from a population of uncertain size, and it is often challenging to estimate their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure. Additionally, many of these reported cases of myocardial infarction occurred in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, often in close temporal proximity to sexual activity, which itself increases cardiac workload and risk of AMI.

It is also stated that it is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to tadalafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, a combination of these factors, or to other factors. Without more definitive research, such as observational studies or randomized controlled trials specifically examining the incidence of AMI in patients taking tadalafil, it cannot be firmly concluded that tadalafil directly causes AMI.

In summary, although acute myocardial infarction is not a commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical trials of tadalafil, there have been postmarketing reports of AMI in temporal association with tadalafil use. However, a clear causal relationship has not been established due to the complexity of confounding factors and lack of precise frequency estimation in the postmarketing surveillance data.","NA 

The information provided in the drug label does not refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to tadalafil. Instead, it states that serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. However, it also recognizes that most of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factor and that it is not possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure definitively."
acute myocardial infarction,talc,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label—adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings—there is no direct mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an observed adverse reaction to the intrapleural use of various talc products, including STERITALC®. The listed common adverse reactions to intrapleural talc administration include fever, pain, dyspnea, arrhythmia, empyema, pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, procedure-related adverse reactions like bleeding, hemothorax, wound infections, atelectasis, and pneumonia may occur.

Warnings and precautions from the label specifically discuss the risk of pneumonitis and ARDS, with fatal cases reported, and the potential impact on systemic exposure of talc, which could be affected by the integrity of the visceral pleura. Also, the particle size distribution of talc may correlate with the risk of toxicity. However, in two large, prospective trials evaluating STERITALC's safety for intrapleural administration, no cases of ARDS or talc-related lung injury were reported.

The section on interference with future procedures and lead content does not mention AMI either. It addresses other risks such, as pleural sclerosis potentially complicating future surgeries or diagnostic procedures, and the toxicity related to lead content in STERITALC®, specifically its impact on the nervous system and other organs, but not AMI.

Hence, there is no known evidence provided in the drug labeling sections you've supplied to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is a recognized adverse reaction to the intrapleural use of talc or STERITALC® specifically. Further exploration of extensive clinical trial databases, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports could be required to find any reports or studies of AMI as a potential adverse reaction to talc exposure. However, based on the available sections of the drug label, there is no established relationship between talc exposure and AMI.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tamoxifen,,"The information provided from the drug label does not specifically report acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to tamoxifen in the adverse reactions section, in the warnings, or in the boxed warnings. However, under the section of the ""Anastrozole Adjuvant Trial"" (a study comparing anastrozole and tamoxifen), myocardial infarction was reported in 37 patients (1.2%) in the anastrozole arm and in 34 patients (1.1%) in the tamoxifen arm. This suggests that while AMI was reported in patients taking tamoxifen, the incidence was very similar to that in patients taking anastrozole. This does not establish a direct relationship between tamoxifen and AMI, as the study was not primarily designed to assess this outcome, and the rates were similar between the two treatment arms.

Additionally, the section on ischemic cardiovascular disease under the table of pre-specified adverse events in the ""Anastrozole Adjuvant Trial"" shows that ischemic cardiovascular disease occurred in 127 patients (4%) in the anastrozole arm and 104 patients (3%) in the tamoxifen arm. This includes a range of ischemic conditions, not specifically AMI.

Moreover, the label includes a warning for serious and life-threatening events associated with tamoxifen use in the risk reduction setting, which include stroke and pulmonary embolism, but it does not mention AMI.

Therefore, based on the label information, there is some reporting of myocardial infarction in clinical trials involving tamoxifen, but the evidence does not establish a clear causal relationship between tamoxifen therapy and the occurrence of AMI. The incidence appears to be similar to that of another agent, suggesting that AMI might not be a reaction specifically attributable to tamoxifen. Further investigation in targeted studies would be necessary to clarify this potential association.","NA
"
acute myocardial infarction,telmisartan,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for telmisartan, there is no direct evidence in the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance information that directly correlates the use of telmisartan with acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) as an adverse reaction.

In the clinical trials section (6.1), adverse reactions reported in more than 1% of patients and at a rate greater than those seen in placebo patients did not include acute myocardial infarction. The adverse reactions that were more common included upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, sinusitis, diarrhea, and pharyngitis. Other cardiovascular-related adverse events reported include palpitation, dependent edema, angina pectoris, tachycardia, leg edema, and abnormal ECG, but these occurred at or below a 1% incidence rate and without a direct relationship to telmisartan.

Similarly, in the TRANSCEND study mentioned in the label (part of a larger ""Cardiovascular Risk Reduction"" section), the only serious adverse events at least 1% more common on telmisartan than placebo were intermittent claudication and skin ulcer; acute myocardial infarction was not mentioned.

In the section discussing postmarketing experience (6.2), a variety of adverse reactions are reported, which again does not explicitly mention acute myocardial infarction. The cardiovascular disorders listed in the postmarketing experience section include hypotension, edema, and angioedema, among others.

Heart attacks can be complex events often influenced by various risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, age, lifestyle choices, and other comorbidities. While angiotensin receptor blockers like telmisartan are used to manage conditions like hypertension, which is a risk factor for myocardial infarction, the drug label does not specifically list acute myocardial infarction as a known side effect based on the evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance provided in your message.

In summary, based on the provided sections of the drug label and standard information sources, acute myocardial infarction is not identified as an adverse reaction associated with telmisartan in the reported clinical trial data or post-marketing experience. Any individual case of acute myocardial infarction in a patient taking telmisartan would require further investigation to determine causality, considering individual patient risk factors and concurrent medications.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,teriflunomide,,"Based on the information provided from various sections of the drug label for teriflunomide, it appears that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials data or in post-marketing surveillance for this drug.

The summarized data from the label suggest the most typical adverse reactions observed in more than 10% of patients include headache, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Cardiovascular deaths, including sudden death and myocardial infarction, have been reported but were observed during uncontrolled extension studies, one to nine years after initiation of treatment with teriflunomide, according to the clinical trial data.

However, the information explicitly states that ""A relationship between AUBAGIO and cardiovascular death has not been established."" This specific clause indicates that while incidences of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarctions, were recorded, they have not been definitively linked to the use of teriflunomide based on the currently available evidence. Therefore, while a few cardiovascular events have been reported, these data do not establish acute myocardial infarction as a recognized adverse reaction to teriflunomide.

When evaluating the provided postmarketing adverse reactions, no clear causal link between AMI and teriflunomide is reported. The postmarketing section lists various conditions but doesn't specifically mention AMI among them.

In summary, based on the provided drug label information, there is no strong evidence to support a clear relationship between the exposure to teriflunomide and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction as a drug-related adverse reaction. Any incidences of cardiovascular events reported are lacking a firmly established causal link. As always, the reporting of adverse reactions to regulatory agencies is encouraged for the ongoing collection of safety data.","NA

Based on the information provided, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse reaction in the clinical trial data, nor is it included in the postmarketing experience for teriflunomide. The drug label mentions cardiovascular deaths in premarketing database reports but explicitly states that ""A relationship between AUBAGIO and cardiovascular death has not been established."" Therefore, there is no evidence presented in the provided sections to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is an established adverse reaction of teriflunomide."
acute myocardial infarction,teriflunomide,,"Based on the provided drug label information for teriflunomide, there is some evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been noted as an adverse event potentially related to teriflunomide use. The evidence comes from the following:

1. Clinical Trials:
From the pooled analysis of placebo-controlled studies in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, no specific mention of AMI as a common adverse reaction was listed in the ""Adverse Reactions"" section or in Table 1 of clinical trial data. The data provided in the sections indicate common adverse reactions such as headache, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), diarrhea, alopecia, and nausea.

2. Cardiovascular Deaths Noted in Premarketing Clinical Practice:
The label notes that of approximately 2600 patients exposed to teriflunomide in the premarketing database, there were four cardiovascular deaths reported, including three sudden deaths and one myocardial infarction in a patient with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension. These events occurred during uncontrolled extension studies one to nine years after the start of treatment. However, the label clearly states that ""a relationship between teriflunomide and cardiovascular death has not been established."" This suggests that while AMI has been observed, there is insufficient evidence to establish a direct causative relationship between teriflunomine use and AMI.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
The postmarketing surveillance section does not mention AMI directly but reports general adverse reactions identified during post-approval use. It is important to note that these adverse reactions are often voluntarily reported and are not always rigorously validated. Their frequency or causal relationship to drug exposure is not reliably estimable.

In conclusion, while an AMI event was reported in the cardiovascular deaths section within the teriflunomide premarketing database, the drug label does not establish a definitive causal relationship between teriflunomide and AMI. Importantly, such a relationship has not been reported as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials or identified clearly in postmarketing surveillance data based on the provided label sections.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,testosterone,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and testosterone therapy primarily comes from postmarketing surveillance data. The clinical trial data available for testosterone gel, 1% (as detailed in Section 6.1) does not explicitly report AMI as a common adverse reaction. Instead, the adverse reactions reported in these clinical trials include acne, application site reactions, abnormal lab tests, and prostatic disorders.

However, section 5.5 of the Warnings and Precautions and section 6.2, which reports on Postmarketing Experience, indicate that myocardial infarction has been identified as an adverse event during post-approval use of testosterone gel, 1%. Although the incidence of this complication is not clearly defined in this section, the label advises that there is an observed risk, even if it might not be frequently occurring.

Additionally, the label warns that ""some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with the use of testosterone replacement therapy"" (Section 5.5). This suggests that there have been instances where patients have experienced AMI as an adverse reaction to testosterone therapy. However, the statement also indicates that the results from different studies have been inconclusive with some, but not all, reporting an increased risk.

It is also worth mentioning that the pharmacovigilance data (in Section 6.2) relies on voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size. Therefore, due to potential underreporting, it can be challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of AMI or firmly establish a causal relationship to drug exposure based on postmarketing surveillance alone.

In conclusion, while AMI is not listed as a common adverse reaction in controlled clinical trials for testosterone gel, 1%, there is evidence from postmarketing surveillance and some epidemiological studies suggesting a potential link between testosterone therapy and an increased risk of AMI. Healthcare providers are advised to be aware of this potential risk and discuss it with patients considering or currently using testosterone replacement therapy.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tezepelumab,,"As of the current knowledge base, there is some evidence to suggest a potential relationship between tezepelumab exposure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This evidence comes from a randomized, double-blind, long-term extension trial that included patients 12 years and older with severe asthma. The trial reported an incidence rate (IR) per 100 patient-years for serious cardiac adverse events including non-fatal myocardial infarctions in patients treated with tezepelumab of 1.08 compared to 0.21 in the placebo group, with an incidence rate difference (IRD) of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.24, 1.53). It's crucial to note that this information does not confirm causality but suggests a higher occurrence of serious cardiac adverse events in patients taking tezepelumab compared to those on placebo.

When examining myocardial infarction specifically, the IR per 100 patient-years for adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular deaths, non-fetal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes, was 0.60 in patients treated with tezepelumab and 0.42 for the placebo group, resulting in an IRD of 0.18 (95% CI: -0.51, 0.75). The IRD suggests a non-significant difference, indicating ambiguity and the need for a more detailed assessment to understand the relationship better.

There are no box warnings related to AMI on the product labeling for tezepelumab, and the drug label's warnings and precautions do not explicitly link tezepelumab to an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, this summary does not include any information from postmarketing experience specifically concerning AMI because the data on such adverse reactions are not provided.

In conclusion, evidence from a long-term clinical trial suggests a possible association between tezepelumab and an increased incidence of serious cardiac adverse events, including myocardial infarction, when compared to placebo. However, these findings are not definitively conclusive, and causality cannot be established from the data provided. Additionally, further research, such as more extensive post-marketing surveillance data or sustained monitoring in subsequent trials, would be helpful to strengthen the evidence base and clarify the relationship between tezepelumab and the risk of AMI.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,thalidomide,,"Upon review of the provided drug label sections for thalidomide, there is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction in the ""Adverse Reactions"" section (6). However, in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5), specifically 5.3, there is a reference to ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, as being observed in patients treated with thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone.

The clinical trials mentioned in the label (Study 1 and Study 2) do not list acute myocardial infarction directly within the common adverse reactions tables. But it should be noted that the ""Cardiac Disorders"" section of adverse reactions in Study 2 (grade 3/4) reports myocardial ischemia (which can include myocardial infarction) at 3% in the THALOMID/dexamethasone group versus 1% in the placebo group.

Additionally, venous thromboembolism (VTE) risks, specifically deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which can be associated with an increased risk for heart attack, are clearly identified and discussed throughout the provided label information.

Evidence Summary:
- Ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, is explicitly mentioned in section 5.3 (Warnings and Precautions) as being observed in patients treated with thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone.
- The clinical trials report myocardial ischemia as a Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction (with a 2% increase in the THALOMID/dexamethasone group vs. placebo).
- Although not directly listed under ""Adverse Reactions,"" the label does express concerns about cardiovascular risks, such as venous thromboembolism, which are a recognized risk factor for AMI.

Given that myocardial ischemia is associated with AMI and the label acknowledges the occurrence of ischemic heart disease with thalidomide treatment, it can be inferred that there is a potential relationship between thalidomide exposure and the risk of developing AMI. However, the labeling does not provide detailed incident rates or characterizations of AMI outside of the mention in section 5.3, and it's worth noting that thalidomide has a multitude of serious side effects that are extensively documented, including severe teratogenicity and VTE. To fully assess the relationship between thalidomide exposure and AMI, a thorough review of the primary data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as well as an analysis of peer-reviewed literature, would be required.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tiagabine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no explicit evidence indicating that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a known adverse reaction associated with the use of tiagabine, an antiepileptic medication. The label details various adverse reactions observed in controlled clinical trials, other clinical trials, and postmarketing reports. While cardiovascular adverse events such as palpitation, syncope, tachycardia, and hypertension are mentioned, there is a specific enumeration of myocardial infarction as an ""infrequent"" event under the cardiovascular system section without establishing a direct causal relationship with tiagabine.

Additionally, postmarketing surveillance has yielded reports of various adverse reactions, but again, there is no specific mention of AMI being related to tiagabine use. It is important to note that postmarketing reports, due to their voluntary nature and the uncertain size of the reporting population, often do not provide a reliable estimate of frequency or a definitive causal link to the drug in question.

In such cases where a potential adverse event, like AMI, is not explicitly linked to a drug despite being mentioned, further investigation through additional clinical studies, more extensive postmarketing surveillance, or other pharmacovigilance data could be proposed to establish or refute any such relationship definitively.

In conclusion, while myocardial infarction is listed as an infrequent event observed during clinical trials involving tiagabine, the available information does not provide sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between AMI and tiagabine use. Therefore, healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential event but not assume a direct link based on current evidence. If more detailed information or new data is made available beyond the label's scope, the evaluation of the relationship between tiagabine and AMI could be reconsidered.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tivozanib,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, tivozanib (FOTIVDA) has a documented adverse reaction profile which includes various cardiovascular events. Specifically concerning acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction, the drug label indicates that myocardial infarction was reported in 0.6% of patients who received tivozanib in the TIVO-3 clinical trial. This clinical trial involved patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who received tivozanib after two or more prior systemic therapies compared to those who received sorafenib.

Further, the warnings and precautions section of the drug label identifies cardiac ischemia and arterial thromboembolic events as potential risks associated with tivozanib use, instructing to closely monitor patients who are at increased risk for these events and to permanently discontinue tivozanib for severe arterial thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

It is crucial to note that the rate of incidence and the causal relationship between tivozanib and acute myocardial infarction can only be fully established through detailed analysis of all available data, including the TIVO-3 trial outcomes and post-marketing surveillance. The drug label provides evidence for a statistically rare but clinically documented occurrence of myocardial infarction as an adverse event in patients treated with tivozanib.

Additionally, no specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data are provided within the text from the drug label. Therefore, for conclusive evidence on the link between tivozanib and acute myocardial infarction, further investigation into these sources or additional published literature would be necessary. However, based on the clinical trial data from TIVO-3, there is evidence to suggest a potential relationship between tivozanib and acute myocardial infarction.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tizanidine,,"The sections provided from the drug label for tizanidine do not report acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a recognized adverse reaction associated with the medication either in clinical trial settings or during post-marketing experience.

The clinical trials data (Section 6.1 of the drug label) include common adverse reactions experienced by more than 2% of patients on tizanidine compared to those on placebo. Among these, no mention of AMI is made. The most frequently reported adverse effects are dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness), dizziness, urinary tract infection, and others. Additional reported side effects involve liver injury, hypotension, sedation, and hallucinosis.

The post-marketing experience (Section 6.2) lists adverse events that are voluntarily reported and do not necessarily have a confirmed relationship with drug exposure due to the nature of reporting. For tizanidine, reported events include Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, hepatotoxicity, etc., but not AMI.

In the warnings and precautions sections (5), there is a focus on hypotension, liver injury, sedation, hallucinations, CYP1A2 interactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and special considerations for renal impairment and drug withdrawal. While tizanidine is known to cause hypotension as a result of its mechanism as an α2-adrenergic agonist, which could in theory contribute to cardiovascular events, there is no explicit connection made to AMIs in the information provided.

Therefore, based on the information provided from these sections of the drug label for tizanidine, there is no known evidence to suggest that acute myocardial infarction is an expected or recognized adverse reaction associated with tizanidine use. If instances of AMI have been noted during post-market surveillance, they have not been recognized as significant enough to warrant inclusion in the labeling at the time of knowledge cut-off. Health care providers typically report adverse reactions based on clinical judgment, temporal association to drug exposure, and the known pharmacological action of the drug. It is important for health care professionals to report adverse events to regulatory authorities to enable continuous monitoring of drug safety and effectiveness.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tolcapone,,"Based on the extensive information provided, there is no direct evidence mentioned explicitly linking acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to the use of tolcapone in the adverse reactions, warnings, or the comprehensive list of other potential adverse events observed during clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Tolcapone is a medication typically used in the management of Parkinson's Disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy.

The information provided focuses primarily on hepatic issues, including severe cases of hepatocellular injury and fulminant liver failure observed in a small number of patients during post-marketing use. Clinical trial data showed that adverse reactions more commonly associated with tolcapone included dyskinesia, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, sleep disturbances, vomiting, urine discoloration, somnolence (sleepiness), hallucinations, dystonia, and sweating among others, with the most frequent cause for discontinuation being diarrhea.

Cardiovascular adverse events listed include palpitations, hypertension, vasodilation, angina pectoris, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, various types of heart valve and artery issues, myocardial ischemia, and very infrequently, myocardial infarct (another term for AMI).

The presence of myocardial infarction in the list indicates that there have been rare cases reported, but the specific details such as incidence rate or definitive causal link to tolcapone are not specified. Given it is listed under infrequent cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction has occurred during treatment with tolcapone but appears to be a rare event.

However, because the cardiovascular system is complex and myocardial infarction can be influenced by many factors, it cannot be concluded from the available data alone that tolcapone causes AMI. The reported cases may also be incidental or due to other risk factors present in the treated population, such as the underlying disease state (Parkinson's disease), concomitant medications, or other comorbidities that patients may have had.

For precise quantification of risk and to establish a causal relationship between tolcapone and AMI, more targeted post-marketing surveillance data, dedicated observational studies, or further clinical trial analyses would be needed.

In the absence of specific data on the association between tolcapone and acute myocardial infarction from controlled trials or observational studies, healthcare providers should consider the cardiovascular history and profile of their patients before prescribing tolcapone, and patients should be monitored appropriately. Any suspected adverse reactions should be reported to the relevant health authorities to aid in the ongoing assessment of drug safety.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,toremifene,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for FARESTON (toremifene), evidence of a potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart attack, during toremifene exposure is derived from clinical trials experience and is mentioned in the adverse reactions section of the drug label:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: The evidence within clinical trials is outlined in the adverse reaction rates, which stem from the assessment of several prospectively identified clinical toxicities considered drug-related or possibly drug-related. Specifically, myocardial infarction was reported in patients receiving FARESTON in the three major randomized, controlled clinical trials—North American, Eastern European, and Nordic studies. In the North American Study, myocardial infarction occurred in 2 out of 221 patients (approximately 1%) receiving the 60 mg dose of FARESTON. Comparable events were reported in the other studies, indicating a potential relationship between toremifene exposure and myocardial infarction.

2. Serious Adverse Reactions: The evidence is further emphasized by the listing of myocardial infarction as a serious adverse reaction occurring in at least 1% of patients in the cited trials, identifying it as a possible risk of the medication.

3. Post-marketing Experience: While adverse reactions identified during post-approval use generally encompass hot flashes, sweating, nausea, and vaginal discharge similarly to clinical trial experience, myocardial infarction is specifically mentioned as a reason for treatment discontinuation in 1% of patients due to adverse reactions. This indicates that AMI has been acknowledged as an adverse event associated with toremifene, albeit at a low frequency, and it has been observed after the drug was marketed.

4. Discontinuation Due to Adverse Reactions: Documentation that approximately 1% of patients discontinued FARESTON due to various adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, supports the association between drug exposure and this severe cardiac event.

To summarize, the evidence points to a rare but potential risk of acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with FARESTON, as documented in clinical trial data and cases of discontinuation due to this adverse reaction. These findings are consistently observed across different study populations and post-marketing experiences, indicating that while not common, AMI is a recognized adverse reaction to toremifene. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this risk and manage patients accordingly, taking into account the individual's overall risk factors for cardiac events when considering treatment with toremifene.","NA
"
acute myocardial infarction,tramadol,,"The sections provided do not explicitly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction to tramadol. Adverse cardiovascular effects that are listed include hypotension, tachycardia, and myocardial ischemia among others but do not mention AMI directly. While myocardial ischemia is recognized as a precursor to myocardial infarction, without explicit evidence or clear reporting of AMI as a tramadol-related adverse event, it cannot be definitively stated as an established relationship.

Regarding the evidence:

- **Clinical Trials Experience**: The provided information on clinical trial experiences does not mention AMI as a reported adverse reaction.

- **Postmarketing Experience**: Some cardiovascular events like orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and tachycardia have been identified as adverse reactions during post-approval use of tramadol. Myocardial ischemia is mentioned under ""Other Adverse Experiences, Causal Relationship Unknown"" which means there could be some reported instances, but a causal relation to tramadol use has not been established.

- **Warnings**: The warning sections focus primarily on the risks associated with misuse, respiratory depression, interactions with other CNS depressants, serotonin syndrome, seizure risks, adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, and other opioid-related risks. There is no specific warning regarding AMI.

Therefore, based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is insufficient evidence to establish a direct causal relationship between tramadol exposure and acute myocardial infarction. It is important to keep in mind that case reports or observational studies not included in this drug label may exist, so a comprehensive literature search would be required to draw more definitive conclusions regarding this specific potential adverse event. If any new evidence has emerged post the knowledge cutoff, it may warrant an updated analysis.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,trandolapril,,"The provided drug label sections for trandolapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used primarily for hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, list various adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.

In the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction, the label explicitly mentions ""myocardial infarction"" under the postmarketing section, which indicates that this event has been reported during the post-approval use of trandolapril. However, these reports are voluntary and come from an uncertain population size, making it challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There is no direct evidence presented in the label that suggests that trandolapril causes acute myocardial infarction. Instead, the drug is used post-myocardial infarction for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, with the aim of improving survival and reducing heart failure-related hospitalizations, as evidenced by the TRACE study included in the label. While the postmarketing reports do include myocardial infarction as a reported adverse event, this does not establish causation but rather indicates that it has been observed during the use of the medication.

It is also important to note that patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction are inherently at a higher risk for subsequent cardiac events, including recurrent myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether the reported instances of AMI in the postmarketing section are a direct result of trandolapril use or a consequence of the patients' underlying condition.

In summary, while acute myocardial infarction is listed as an adverse event reported in the postmarketing surveillance of trandolapril, the drug label does not provide evidence from clinical trials that establishes a causal link between trandolapril use and the occurrence of AMI. The reports from postmarketing surveillance alone are insufficient to confirm causality due to a lack of controlled conditions and the potential confounding factor of the underlying health status of the patients.","Based on the drug label information provided for trandolapril, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed as a postmarketing adverse reaction. Postmarketing surveillance often captures adverse events that were not necessarily observed in clinical trials or were not statistically significant when compared to placebo or control groups, possibly due to the larger and more diverse population exposed to the drug after its approval.

However, the label does not provide specific data to refute the relationship between trandolapril and AMI. The absence of evidence refuting the relationship does not necessarily confirm a causative relationship; it may simply indicate that such evidence has not been collected, analyzed, or published to specifically address this connection.

The TRACE study (Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation), cited in the adverse reactions section for patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction, does not list AMI as a frequent adverse event in the treatment group compared to placebo. The focus of the TRACE study was on the efficacy and safety of trandolapril in patients with reduced left ventricular function after myocardial infarction, which implies a subset of patients that already had an AMI.

Conclusively refuting a causal relationship between trandolapril and the incidence of AMI would require specific investigative studies or meta-analyses designed to evaluate this potential adverse reaction. This would involve comparing the incidence of AMI in patients taking trandolapril with a control group not taking the drug, ideally in randomized controlled trials, to determine if there is a significant difference attributable to the medication.

Given the information provided, there is no specific evidence within the drug label that refutes the relationship between AMI and trandolapril usage. Additional research and analysis of clinical trial data, observational studies, and comprehensive reviews would be necessary to reach a conclusion on this matter. Consequently, the response to the question regarding evidence refuting the relationship between AMI and trantolapril is NA, indicating that such evidence is not available in the provided drug label information."
acute myocardial infarction,trazodone,,"Based on the information provided from the adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings sections of the trazodone drug label, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between trazodone exposure and the potential adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

In the postmarketing experience section (6.2) of the trazodone hydrochloride label, myocardial infarction is listed among the cardiac disorders identified as adverse reactions that have been reported. These reports are gathered from voluntary submissions from a population of uncertain size after approval of the drug, making it difficult to precisely estimate the frequency or establish a definite causal relationship to drug exposure. Despite this limitation, the inclusion of myocardial infarction in the label acknowledges its occurrence following trazodone exposure.

Additionally, section 5.3 of the label, under warnings and precautions, emphasizes that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, and advises caution when administering the drug to patients with cardiac disease due to the potential for cardiac arrhythmias which could theoretically lead to AMI.

Furthermore, the label indicates that trazodone hydrochloride prolongs the QT/QTc interval, which is associated with an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, or those taking other medications that also prolong the QT interval, are at increased risk.

While this information establishes a link between trazodone and cardiac-related adverse effects, which can include AMI, the evidence does not come from controlled clinical trials but rather from postmarketing surveillance, which has its limitations in establishing causality. To better understand the risk of AMI in patients using trazodone, further research, such as observational studies or more detailed analysis of postmarketing data, would be needed. It's important for healthcare providers to weigh the benefits and risks of trazodone use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, monitor closely for any signs of cardiac dysfunction, and report any cases of adverse cardiac events to continue to inform the safety profile of the drug.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,tretinoin,,"Based on the provided information, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is listed under the cardiovascular disorders as an adverse reaction occurring in less than 10% of patients who received tretinoid capsules. It is important to note that this reaction is not amongst the ""most common"" adverse reactions (those occurring with a frequency of ≥30%) or the adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients as listed in Table 1 of the drug label.

The label additionally mentions that thromboembolic events, which include myocardial infarction, have been reported with tretinoin usage, and these events may occur during the first month of treatment. This indicates that the relationship between tretinoin and acute myocardial infarction has been observed in postmarketing experience, although a precise incidence rate or causal relationship cannot be reliably established due to the nature of voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size.

In summary, there is evidence from postmarketing surveillance to suggest that acute myocardial infarction can occur as an adverse reaction to tretinoin capsules, but the incidence appears to be low and precise risk evaluation is challenging due to the limitations inherent to voluntary reporting systems. Clinical trials data do not prominently feature AMI as a common adverse reaction. Health care providers should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, particularly in the first month of treatment with tretinoin capsules.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,triamcinolone,,"Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence mentioned in the sections of the drug label you provided (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings) that links triamcinolone, a corticosteroid, to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions listed for triamcinolone are primarily related to local skin conditions and do not include systemic effects such as AMI.

To further address your question, a search of available scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and post-marketing surveillance summaries would be necessary to determine if there is any known association between triamcinolone and acute myocardial infarction. In the usual process of pharmacovigilance, if such an association were suspected or identified, it would likely be reported in the medical literature, and regulatory agencies might require that the information be added to the drug's labeling.

However, without evidence from these sources provided here, I can state that, according to the drug label sections you have referenced, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as a known adverse reaction of triamcinolone. If you suspect a correlation based on new or emerging data, I recommend performing a comprehensive review of the latest scientific publications, clinical trial data, and post-marketing reports to ascertain any potential link that might not yet be reflected in the drug label.

Remember, drug labels may not contain exhaustive lists of adverse reactions, particularly if such events are very rare or only recently observed. Health professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to appropriate drug safety monitoring programs, which can help detect rare but serious side effects that may not have been identified during pre-marketing trials.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,trimipramine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings related to trimipramine, it is stated that myocardial infarction is among the cardiovascular adverse reactions that have been reported. However, it is important to note that the label also specifies that some of the listed reactions have not been reported with trimipramine maleate specifically. The inclusion of myocardial infarction in the adverse reactions may be based on the pharmacological similarities among the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) as a class, rather than on direct evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance for trimipramine alone.

To provide a precise and specific summary in accordance with available evidence:

- Clinical Trials: The provided label does not specify whether cases of myocardial infarction were identified during clinical trials of trimipramine. Given the drug label's statement, it can be assumed that there may not be direct clinical trial evidence linking trimipramine to acute myocardial infarction without further data.

- Case Studies: The label does not mention specific case studies where trimipramine was definitively linked to myocardial infarction. The connection to myocardial infarction could be related to the broader pharmacological class of TCAs, and not necessarily to individual case reports for trimipramine.

- Post-marketing Surveillance: While post-marketing surveillance might include reports of myocardial infarction, these can be voluntary and the label does not specify whether myocardial infarction was reported more frequently than expected in the population treated with trimipramine. Adverse reaction reporting systems do not always establish causation but can raise alerts to potential concerns to be investigated.

It is also worth considering that trimipramine, like other TCAs, has well-documented effects on the cardiovascular system, such as hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmias, and heart block, which are plausible pathways that could lead to myocardial infarction. However, it's also possible that associated cardiovascular events could be due to pre-existing conditions, concomitant medications, or other risk factors in patients taking trimipramine.

To conclusively establish a relationship between trimipramine and acute myocardial infarction, we would need more detailed evidence such as case reports that have conclusively identified trimipramine as the causative factor or epidemiological studies demonstrating a higher incidence of myocardial infarction in patients taking trimipramine compared to those not exposed to the drug.

In summary, while myocardial infarction is listed as a potential adverse reaction of trimipramine, the drug label indicates that some adverse reactions may not have been specifically reported with trimipramine use. Without additional detailed evidence directly linking trimipramine to myocardial infarction, it remains a theoretical risk possibly extrapolated from the wider class of TCAs. Healthcare providers should consider individual patient risk factors and the broader side effect profile of TCAs when prescribing trimipramine.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,triptorelin,,"The provided drug label sections for triptorelin, an agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), discuss a range of adverse reactions noted in clinical settings. Among these, cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, have been identified as a risk associated with its use.

To summarize the evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and triptorelin exposure:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
- Triptorelin treatment has been evaluated in clinical trials involving patients with advanced prostate cancer.
- Common adverse reactions linked to triptorelin in clinical trials (≥ 5%) include hot flushes, skeletal pain, impotence, headache, edema in legs, leg pain, erectile dysfunction, and testicular atrophy across the different dosages (3.75 mg, 11.25 mg, and 22.5 mg).
- Specific cardiovascular adverse reactions reported at a rate above 1% for the 3.75 mg and 11.25 mg doses include hypertension.
- It is important to note that the reported cardiovascular disorders related to the 11.25 mg triptorelin dose included chest pain in 1.7% of patients and hypertension in 4% of patients. These reports, while not exclusively indicative of myocardial infarction, are connected with cardiovascular events.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
- The post-marketing experience section of the drug label indicates that myocardial infarction, a type of acute cardiovascular event, has been identified as an adverse reaction during the post-approval use of GnRH agonists like triptorelin.
- These reports are collected voluntarily, and because of the uncertain size of the reporting population, it is challenging to estimate the frequency or establish a direct causal relationship to drug exposure.
- However, the voluntary reports still contribute to the evidence associating myocardial infarction with triptorelin use.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
- The Warnings and Precautions section of the drug label (5.4) notes an increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke reported in association with the use of GnRH agonists in men.
- While indicating that the risk based on reported odds ratios is low, the evidence does suggest a relationship between triptorelin use and these serious cardiovascular events.
- Patients receiving triptorelin should be monitored for symptoms indicative of cardiovascular disease and managed according to current guidelines.

In conclusion, while common adverse reactions to triptorelin primarily relate to its therapeutic action and the expected symptoms following testosterone level variation, there is evidence, both from clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, supporting an association between triptorelin exposure and the risk of acute myocardial infarction. The cardiovascular risk warrants careful consideration and patient monitoring during triptorelin therapy.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,vardenafil,,"Evidence regarding the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the use of vardenafil can be drawn from the drug label sections provided, which include adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing surveillance.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
The clinical studies section (6.1) did not list AMI as a common adverse reaction. The trials involved over 17,000 men and provided data on common reactions such as headache, flushing, and nasal congestion, but there is no specific mention of the incidence rate of AMI in the clinical trials mentioned.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Under section 6.2, AMI is identified as an adverse reaction during post-marketing experience with vardenafil. Because post-marketing reports are based on voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size, the exact frequency and causal relationship to vardenafil are not always clear. However, the listing of AMI in this section suggests that there have been reports of its occurrence following the use of vardenafil post approval.

Cardiovascular Warnings:
In sections 5.1 and related warnings, the label highlights the cardiovascular risks associated with sexual activity in patients with existing cardiovascular conditions. Vardenafil should not be used in men with certain conditions such as severe cardiac failure, recent myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months), or those with unstable angina, among others. Such warnings imply a recognition that vardenafil can have significant cardiovascular effects, which might possibly include the triggering of an AMI, especially in predisposed individuals.

Conclusion:
While the label provided lists AMI as an adverse reaction identified in post-marketing experience, this recognition underscores that there may be a potential link between AMI and vardenafil. However, the incidences in controlled clinical trials are not detailed, so it is difficult to ascertain the strength of this relationship from clinical trial data alone. The warnings concerning the use of vardenafil in patients with cardiovascular risk factors further highlight the need for caution due to the possible adverse effects on cardiovascular health. It is important to note that while post-marketing cases have prompted the inclusion of AMI as a reported adverse reaction, these voluntary reports do not establish a definitive causal relationship. Thus, healthcare professionals should weigh the benefits and risks when prescribing vardenafil, especially to patients with known cardiovascular risks.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for vardenafil hydrochloride tablets, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is listed under the ""Cardiovascular"" subtitle as one of the adverse reactions identified during clinical development and postmarketing experience. Although such events are mentioned to be infrequent, there is an acknowledgment of their occurrence, implying a recognized association with the drug usage. Therefore, there is evidence to suggest a relationship between vardenafil hydrochloride tablets and acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction, and it cannot be stated that acute myocardial infarction is not an adverse reaction of vardenafil.

NA"
acute myocardial infarction,varenicline,,"The provided drug label information for varenicline includes several sections that discuss adverse reactions, including cardiac disorders. Here is a summary of the evidence related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction of varenicline based on the sections provided:

- **Clinical Trials Experience**: During the premarketing development of varenicline, which involved over 4500 subjects, cardiac disorders, including myocardial infarction (MI), were infrequently reported. However, it is important to note that premarketing clinical trials may be limited in detecting rare adverse events due to smaller sample sizes and shorter duration of exposure when compared to real-world post-marketing surveillance.

- **Postmarketing Experience**: Following the drug’s release, there have been reports of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events in patients taking varenicline. Although smoking itself is a risk factor for myocardial infarction, the temporal relationship between the medication use and the events suggests that a contributory role of varenicline cannot be ruled out. These reports come from voluntary reporting systems, which can be subject to underreporting and lack of control groups for comparison, but they do provide insight into potential adverse reactions that did not emerge during the controlled clinical trial phase.

- **Cardiovascular Events Warnings and Precautions**: The label indicates that there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease taking varenicline, but these concerns need to be balanced with the health benefits of smoking cessation. In the section 5.5 of the Warnings and Precautions, reference is made to a smoking cessation trial in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, where nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke occurred more frequently in patients treated with varenicline compared to placebo. Another meta-analysis included in this section indicated an increased, yet not statistically significant, hazard ratio for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) with varenicline. 

The evidence from post-marketing experience and the specific references within the Warnings and Precautions section of the drug label suggest a potential association between varenicline and acute myocardial infarction, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions. The warnings indicate that while the absolute risk may be low, healthcare providers should be vigilant about the possibility of such events, and patients should be advised to report new or worsening cardiovascular symptoms. The data from clinical trials alone do not establish a clear relationship due primarily to the underrepresentation of such rare events in controlled trial settings. Thus, much of the evidence is derived from observational post-marketing data, which suggest a potential but not definitively proven association.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,venlafaxine,,"The provided drug label information for venlafaxine does not directly list acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as a common adverse reaction. However, there are some cardiovascular-related adverse events reported that could be of relevance when considering the potential for AMI. These include:

- Increased blood pressure/hypertension: The drug label notes that venlafaxine hydrochloride treatment was associated with mean increases in diastolic blood pressure, which is dose-dependent. Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for AMI.
- Tachycardia and changes in heart rate: A mean increase in pulse rate associated with venlafaxine is also noted in the label, as well as ECG changes reflecting a mean heart rate increase.
- Cardiovascular system adverse events: While not specifically mentioning AMI, the label documents infrequent and rare cases of other serious cardiovascular events, including angina pectoris, arrhythmia, syncope, and thrombophlebitis. Rare events include myocardial infarct.

In the postmarketing reports section of the label, there is a mention of various cardiovascular-related pathological events, but AMI is not mentioned explicitly. There are general references to events like cardiac arrhythmias, which could sometimes be related to or precede an AMI.

It should be noted that the absence of AMI in the label's listed adverse reactions or postmarketing reports does not mean that the event has not been recorded; it could be that its incidence is too low to reach statistical significance, or that causality has not been clearly established.

To properly evaluate the relationship between venlafaxine and AMI, one would need to review additional sources such as peer-reviewed clinical studies, case reports, and larger-scale epidemiological research. This would include looking for evidence of temporal association, dose-response relationship, biological plausibility, and exclusion of alternative explanations.

In the absence of such detailed review here, the evidence from the provided drug label alone does not definitively support a direct relationship between venlafaxine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Further investigation with specific research data would be necessary to establish a more conclusive link.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,verapamil,,"The available evidence pertaining to the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction and exposure to verapamil does not directly emerge from the provided drug label sections ('Adverse Reactions', 'Warnings', and 'Box Warnings') for verapamil hydrochloride injection.

In the specified sections from the drug label, cardiovascular adverse reactions mentioned include symptomatic hypotension, bradycardia, and severe tachycardia. The cumulative experience from controlled U.S. clinical trials involving 324 patients, as well as open trials with over 7,900 patients, does not list acute myocardial infarction as a reported adverse event. Other non-cardiovascular effects such as dizziness, headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and occasional cases of seizures are noted, as well as rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions.

Although acute myocardial infarction is not listed in the provided sections of the drug label, it's important to note that the absence of this specific adverse event in the label does not entirely exclude the possibility of its occurrence. The labeling information might not capture all cases of adverse reactions, and post-marketing surveillance is critical to detecting rare but serious side effects that may manifest after a drug has been approved for use. 

If acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to verapamil is a concern, additional sources of evidence such as published case studies, observational studies, and pharmacovigilance databases should be reviewed for any documented association. Based on the information provided, there is no evidence from the drug label that directly supports a relationship between acute myocardial infarction and the administration of verapamil.

For a more comprehensive analysis, examining scientific literature and reports in pharmacovigilance databases, such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), could potentially yield more insights into post-marketing cases of AMI possibly associated with verapil use. As of the knowledge cutoff date for this response, no additional information has been provided to support a conclusion on this matter.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for verapamil, acute myocardial infarction is not listed as an adverse reaction observed in controlled U.S. clinical trials involving 324 patients or in the broader worldwide experience with more than 7,900 patients in open clinical trials. The cardiovascular adverse reactions mentioned include symptomatic hypotension, bradycardia, and severe tachycardia.

While verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can affect cardiovascular function, the specific adverse reaction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is not cited in the excerpt provided from the drug label. Therefore, within the context of this information, there is no evidence presented that directly refutes acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction of verapamil.

It should be noted that the absence of mention in the adverse reactions section of a drug label does not categorically refute the potential for a drug to cause a particular adverse event. Drug labels typically list common and well-documented reactions; less frequent or controversial associations may not be included. Additionally, post-marketing surveillance and further research may identify adverse events not previously recognized in initial clinical trials.

To fully refute a potential adverse reaction, specific studies or meta-analyses designed to explore the relationship between the drug exposure and the adverse event in question would be necessary. Without such data provided here, we can only report the absence of acute myocardial infarction from the documented common adverse reactions associated with verapamil as indicated on the drug label."
acute myocardial infarction,vinblastine,,"The provided drug label mentions that cardiovascular adverse reactions, including myocardial infarction, have been reported very rarely in association with the use of vinblastine. Specifically, the label states that ""Cardiac effects such as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and transient abnormalities of ECG related to coronary ischemia have been reported very rarely.""

This suggests that while there have been instances where myocardial infarction has occurred in patients using vinblastine, this outcome is infrequent. The label also notes that unexpected myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents have occurred in patients undergoing combination chemotherapy with vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatin, implying that the risk could be higher with combination therapy than with vinblastine alone.

However, the label does not provide specific details about clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data that could help establish a causal relationship or understand the incidence and risk factors associated with myocardial infarction during vinblastine therapy. Furthermore, the phrasing ""reported very rarely"" indicates that these episodes are not common enough to establish a solid evidence basis solely based on frequency.

In clinical practice, the recognition of myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction to a drug requires a careful evaluation of cases, including the temporal relationship between drug exposure and the event, the patient's medical history, and the exclusion of other risk factors for myocardial infarction.

In summary, based on the given sections of the drug label, there is a mention of myocardial infarction as a rare adverse reaction to vinblastine, often in the context of combination chemotherapy regimens including bleomycin and cisplatin. However, there is insufficient information provided here to evaluate the strength or quality of the evidence supporting a direct causal relationship. Detailed information from clinical trials, case studies, or robust post-marketing surveillance data would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this potential adverse reaction. Without further detailed evidence, one should cautiously interpret the relationship between vinblastine and myocardial infarction as observational and possibly incidental until more substantive data is available.","There is minimal evidence to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and drug exposure to vinblastine. Within the drug label sections provided on adverse reactions and warnings, there is an indication that cardiovascular effects such as myocardial infarction have been reported ""very rarely.""

These rare reports of AMI in patients treated with vinblastine are not sufficient to establish a causative relationship, especially since other confounding factors could contribute to the event, such as underlying disease states, concurrent medications, or patient-specific risk factors. However, the fact that AMI has been reported, albeit very rarely, suggests a possible association rather than allowing for a definitive conclusion that vinblastine does not have AMI as an adverse reaction.

Evidence that could potentially refute the relationship would typically include large-scale epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, randomized controlled clinical trials, or comprehensive pharmacovigilance data analyses that show no increased risk of AMI with vinblastine use. However, based on the information given, which primarily describes the adverse reactions observed and frequencies as reported in the drug label, there is no detailed source presented that thoroughly refutes the relationship between vinblastine and acute myocardial infarction.

In the absence of more detailed studies or data, the position remains that while AMI has been reported very rarely with vinblastine use, there is not enough substantial evidence to completely refute the potential relationship. Therefore, the summary is that there is minimal evidence to refute the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and drug exposure to vinblastine, based on the rare reports indicated in the drug label."
acute myocardial infarction,vincristine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is mention of cardiovascular adverse reactions, including hypertension and hypotension, associated with vincristine use. The label also notes that chemotherapy combinations, which have included vincristine sulfate, can be associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack) when given to patients previously treated with mediastinal radiation. However, the label explicitly states: ""Causality has not been established,"" indicating that a direct link between vincristine administration and acute myocardial infarction has not been confirmed.

No specific evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance is provided in the label excerpt indicating a causal relationship between vincristine and acute myocardial infarction. This potentially suggests that while there have been observations of myocardial infarction in some patients receiving vincristine as part of a chemotherapy regimen, these cases have not been sufficient to establish a direct and definitive adverse reaction relationship. It is also important to consider that patients receiving chemotherapy often have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which may contribute to the occurrence of myocardial infarction.

In summary, according to the supplied drug label sections, there is no established evidence directly linking vincristine sulfate to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction. Any observed associations in clinical settings have not led to a conclusive determination of causality, as of the provided information.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,vinorelbine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for vinorelbine, there is a rare but documented instance of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurring in less than 0.1% of patients. The evidence supporting the relationship between AMI and vinorelbine exposure is as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   Acute myocardial infarction is reported as an adverse reaction in the section describing the clinical trials experience with vinorelbine. While the drug label mentions that chest pain occurred in 5% of patients, the occurrence of myocardial infarction is specifically stated to be less than 0.1%.

2. Postmarketing Surveillance:
   There is no explicit mention of acute myocardial infarction in the section on postmarketing experience. However, cardiac disorders such as tachycardia are noted, which indicates that cardiac side effects have been observed after the drug has been approved and marketed.

It is important to note that cause-and-effect relationships between a drug and adverse events observed post-marketing can be challenging to establish definitively due to the voluntary nature of reporting and lack of controlled settings.

It can be concluded that while acute myocardial infarction is identified as a potential adverse reaction to vinorelbine, it appears to be a very rare event. The primary source of this information is derived from the drug label based on clinical trial data.

For healthcare professionals and patients, understanding the risk of such a serious adverse event, even if rare, is critical for making informed decisions about the use of vinorelbine, weighing the benefits against potential risks, and for close monitoring for symptoms of a cardiac event during treatment.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,voriconazole,,"There is no specific mention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction in the extensive labeling information provided for voriconazole, which includes details from clinical trials, post-marketing experience, and warnings and precautions.

Reviewing the sections pertaining to adverse reactions and post-marketing experiences, cardiovascular reactions including arrhythmias and QT prolongation, which could predispose a patient to ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes, cardiac arrests, and sudden deaths, are cited. However, these cardiac events are generally described in the context of seriously ill patients with multiple comorbid conditions that may contribute to the observed reactions.

Specifically, voriconazole is noted to have a potential for QT interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram, and caution is mentioned for patients with proarrhythmic conditions. However, myocardial infarction, which is characterized by the interruption of blood supply to a part of the heart resulting in heart muscle damage or necritization, is not explicitly described as a known or observed adverse effect of voriconazole therapy, neither in clinical trial data nor in post-marketing surveillance listed.

Given the absence of explicit evidence supporting the relationship between voriconazole exposure and acute myocardial infarction in the provided labeling details, it appears there is no known established evidence linking voriconazole to acute myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction as of the provided data and knowledge cutoff. Healthcare professionals should continue to monitor for the known cardiac effects associated with voriconazole, such as QT prolongation and arrhythmias, especially in patients with contributing risk factors or pre-existing cardiac conditions.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,vorinostat,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ZOLINZA (vorinostat), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is mentioned as an adverse reaction that occurred in clinical trials. Specifically, under the ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" section, it is stated that there was a single event of myocardial infarction reported among CTCL (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) patients who received a 400 mg once daily dose of vorinostat. This suggests that in the context of these clinical trials, there was at least one instance of AMI being observed as an adverse reaction to the drug.

The evidence of this potential adverse reaction is derived from clinical trial observations and is documented in the product labelling under the section ""Serious Adverse Reactions."" However, the labeling does not provide information on the incidence rate of AMI compared to control subjects or the general population, which makes it difficult to establish a definite causal relationship between vorinostat exposure and AMI.

It is also important to note that adverse reactions, like myocardial infarction, can occur due to a variety of factors and may not be directly attributable to the drug itself. Physicians often weigh the potential benefits of a drug against the risk of serious adverse reactions when considering treatment options for their patients.

Since myocardial infarction is listed under serious adverse reactions, healthcare practitioners are likely to monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of cardiac events during treatment with vorinostat, especially in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.

For specific clinical decisions, healthcare providers typically consider individual patient risk factors and comorbidities, and they may also consult more detailed safety data and research studies, if available, that could further inform the risk of AMI with vorinostat treatment.

No additional details regarding post-marketing surveillance or case studies specifically linking vorinostat to acute myocardial infarction are included in the provided drug label sections. If information from these sources is needed, further investigation into post-marketing reports or the medical literature may be warranted.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,zolmitriptan,1.0,"Evidence supporting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction (MI) and zolmitriptan exposure primarily comes from post-marketing surveillance and specific warnings included in the drug's prescribing information.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
- Clinical trials detailed in the drug label do not cite acute MI as a common adverse reaction to zolmitriptan.
- In the clinical trials section (6.1), the most common reactions (≥5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth, but no direct mention is made of acute MI.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- The drug label mentions under Warnings and Precautions (5.1) that there have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, following the administration of zolmitriptan.
- These can occur within a few hours of administration of the drug.
- Section (6.2) reiterates that acute MI has been identified as an adverse reaction during post-approval use, but it is important to note that these reports are based on voluntary reporting from an uncertain population size, and it is difficult to establish a reliable estimate of frequency or a causal relationship.

Mechanism of Action Related Evidence:
- Zolmitriptan is a 5-HT1 agonist, and these substances are known to cause coronary artery vasospasm (5.1). This vasospasm can sometimes lead to myocardial ischemia, which can result in an MI. This mechanism provides a biological plausibility for the association.

Risk Factors and Precautions:
- Warnings and Precautions sections (5.1 and 5.3) suggest a cardiovascular evaluation for patients with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) prior to dispensing zolmitriptan. It is contraindicated in patients with a history of CAD or ischemic heart conditions, indicating that pre-existing heart conditions heighten the risk of MI when using zolmitriptan.

In summary, while controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan do not commonly report acute MI as an adverse reaction, post-marketing surveillance has identified cases of MI following the use of the drug. The mechanism of action of zolmitriptan and its effects on coronary vasculature underpin the biological plausibility for such an adverse event. Given the rarity of these reports and the lack of a detailed breakdown of occurrences, it is challenging to conclusively determine the incidence or fully establish causality. However, the evidence present in the warnings and precautions clearly indicates that there is a recognized concern for myocardial infarction as an adverse reaction in certain susceptible individuals.",NA
acute myocardial infarction,zolpidem,,"After reviewing the sections provided from the drug label, there is no explicit evidence that directly links zolpidem exposure to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an adverse reaction. The cardiovascular system adverse events mentioned in the clinical trials and post-marketing experience sections of the zolpidem drug label include palpitations and chest pain, but acute myocardial infarction is not listed among the most commonly observed reactions. 

Within the labeled data, under the cardiovascular system subsection, myocardial infarction is listed as a rare event and the label specifies that ""the events reported did occur during treatment with zolpidem tartrate, they were not necessarily caused by it.""

Therefore, while there is a mention of myocardial infarction in the context of rare events potentially associated with zolpidem use, the available information does not establish a definitive causal relationship between zolpidem exposure and acute myocardial infarction. This rare listing indicates that if such an event was reported, it was infrequent and a direct connection to the drug was not confirmed.

For a conclusive association between zolpidem and acute myocardial infarction, detailed clinical studies or case reports that demonstrate a clear relationship would be required. Based on the information provided from the drug label, such evidence is not available or has not been established in controlled clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance to the extent that it would be included as a labeled adverse reaction. Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that acute myocardial infarction is an adverse reaction of zolpidem based on the presented information.",NA
gi bleed,acamprosate,,"The provided drug label information for acamprosate does not specifically list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a known adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. Based on the adverse reactions section (section 6) and the warnings section (section 5), the most common adverse events related to acamprosate usage reported at a rate of greater than 3% and more often than with placebo include:

- Accidental injury
- Asthenia (weakness)
- Pain
- Anorexia
- Diarrhea
- Flatulence
- Nausea
- A range of nervous system-related symptoms such as anxiety, depression, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, paresthesia, and others

GI-related common adverse events listed involve anorexia, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea. Digestive system side effects that are more serious and less frequent include vomiting, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, and increased appetite. Various infrequent or rare events are cited which relate to gastrointestinal health, such as gastroenteritis, gastritis, dysphagia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and others; however, GI bleed is not specifically mentioned, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage may not necessarily represent the GI bleed in context.

Under the post-marketing experience section (6.2), reports are included that came in from the voluntary submissions post drug approval. These adverse reactions do not have a clear frequency or a definitive causal relationship with acamprosate due to the nature of their reporting. Despite this, there is no mention of GI bleed as a post-marketing adverse reaction.

In conclusion, according to the provided sections of the drug label for acamprosate, there is no direct evidence provided that indicates a relationship between GI bleed and acamprosate exposure from controlled clinical trials or post-marketing data. If occurrences of GI bleed were reported, they were not frequent enough to be highlighted as a main concern in the data furnished up to the knowledge cutoff of March 2023. It is always possible that new information could emerge, so healthcare providers should use the latest clinical data and reporting systems for the most current insights regarding drug safety.",NA
gi bleed,adalimumab,,"The provided drug label information for adalimumab does not explicitly report gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. However, the Digestive System section of the ""Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies"" briefly lists gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which may include GI bleeding, as an infrequent serious adverse reaction. This implies that GI bleed has been observed but is not a prevalence or well-characterized reaction in the context of adalimumab use based on available clinical trial data.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The label’s ""Clinical Trials Experience"" section focuses on common adverse reactions such as injection site reactions and infections but does not mention GI bleeding as a significant or common adverse event in clinical trials.

Postmarketing Experience:
GI bleeding is not specifically listed in the provided Postmarketing Experience section. However, the section does mention gastrointestinal disorders such as diverticulitis and large bowel perforations, which can sometimes be associated with GI bleeding.

Warnings and Precautions:
The ""Warnings and Precautions"" section does not directly address GI bleed as a known adverse reaction. It includes serious warnings about infections and malignancy, but not GI bleeding.

Safety Profile Summary:
While GI bleeding is not explicitly described as a common adverse reaction to adalimumab from the provided label information, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is mentioned as a less common serious adverse event in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which might imply a potential relationship. Given the lack of direct and explicit evidence linking adalimumab to GI bleed as a common adverse reaction, healthcare providers and patients should be vigilant in monitoring for any signs of GI bleeding, especially in individuals with additional risk factors for such an event. For a definitive summary and guidance, consultation of the most recent and complete prescribing information would be essential. If further information is needed, contacting the drug manufacturer or reviewing additional post-marketing data and clinical literature might be warranted.",NA
gi bleed,aldesleukin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for aldesleukin (Proleukin), there is documented evidence that gastrointestinal adverse reactions can occur in patients treated with this medication. Specifically, gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and vomiting are common adverse reactions, occurring in more than 30% of patients (referenced in the Clinical Trials Experience, Table 4). Additionally, other gastrointestinal adverse reactions like stomatitis, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite have been recorded.

Moreover, under the section for ""Other Clinical Trial Experience,"" gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal bleeding such as a GI bleed, is listed as a life-threatening adverse reaction (Grade 4), occurring in less than 1% of the 525 patients treated with Proleukin. This indicates that while GI bleed is a rare adverse reaction, there is evidence of its occurrence in the clinical trial population.

The Postmarketing Experience also lists significant adverse reactions identified after approval of Proleukin that may not be reflected in the clinical trial data. However, a specific mention of GI bleed as a direct post-marketing adverse reaction from the use of aldesleukin is not provided in the summary. These reports are voluntarily submitted and the frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always clear, but gastrointestinal disorders such as gastritis and intestinal obstruction are noted.

In summary, there is clinical trial evidence to suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding is a potential adverse reaction to aldesleukin, although it appears to be a rare event. Continuous monitoring and reporting of post-marketing adverse reactions are crucial for further understanding the full spectrum of potential side effects associated with aldesleukin therapy.",NA
gi bleed,allopurinol,,"The information provided in the drug label for allopurinol includes gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) under the section ""Less Common Adverse Reactions (< 1%)"" associated with allopurinol use. This indicates that GI bleed has been reported as an adverse reaction to allopurinol, but it is considered a less common reaction, occurring in less than 1% of patients.

The label specifies that gastrointestinal bleeding, along with other gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions such as vomiting, intermittent abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsia, and hemorrhagic pancreatitis, have been identified through literature reports, unpublished clinical trials, or post-marketing reports. However, due to the nature of voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of such reactions or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There are no specific details provided in the sections ""Adverse Reactions,"" ""Warnings and Precautions,"" or ""Boxed Warning"" about clinical trials specifically focusing on GI bleed as an adverse reaction of allopurinol. The lack of precise frequency data and the nature of post-marketing surveillance suggest that the evidence for a causal relationship between allopurinol exposure and GI bleed is based on less robust data sources, such as spontaneous reports, and may necessitate further investigation to establish a stronger causal link.

The reporting of suspected adverse reactions is encouraged to help improve the understanding of the drug's safety profile. Healthcare professionals and patients are advised to report any suspected adverse reactions to Par Pharmaceutical or the FDA.

In conclusion, while gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported as an adverse reaction to allopurinol, it is categorized as a less common adverse event. The available evidence seems to come from post-marketing reports and possibly unpublished data, which are generally less rigorous than evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials. Therefore, while there is an indication of a potential relationship between GI bleed and allopurinol, the available information does not provide a detailed cause-and-effect evaluation or a measure of incidence.",NA
gi bleed,amiloride,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for Amiloride HCl, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is listed as an adverse reaction with an incidence of 1% or less. This categorization suggests that GI bleeding has been observed in clinical studies or reported in post-marketing surveillance, but at a relatively low frequency.

Here are the details from the provided label sections summarizing the evidence for the relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and Amiloride exposure:

1. Clinical Trials: The incidence of greater than 1% adverse reactions was determined from clinical studies conducted in the United States with 837 patients treated with Amiloride HCl. However, GI bleeding is not listed in this group, suggesting that it was not observed at a rate greater than 1% in the clinical trial population.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance: The adverse effects with an incidence of 1% or less include reports from the same clinical studies as well as voluntary reports since the marketing of the drug. GI bleeding falls into this category, which means that it has been reported post-marketing, but the exact incidence rate is not specified beyond being 1% or less.

3. Causal Relationship: While GI bleeding is mentioned among adverse reactions where a causal relationship with Amiloride HCl ""exists,"" the infrequency of reports and lack of detailed evidence from large-scale studies make it unclear how strong this relationship is. It is important to note that many of the reports may have a questionable relationship to Amiloride, and the overall frequency of GI bleeding was similar in hydrochlorothiazide-treated groups, suggesting that the association may not be unique to Amiloride.

Therefore, while there is evidence to suggest that GI bleeding is a potential adverse reaction to Amiloride, the available information indicates that this is a relatively rare event. Clinicians should be aware of this potential reaction but also consider other factors that may contribute to the occurrence of GI bleeding in patients, such as underlying conditions or the use of other medications known to increase bleeding risk.

The drug label's advice to serve the listed observations as ""alerting information to physicians"" underscores the importance of monitoring and evaluating individual patient risk factors and clinical presentation when considering the likelihood of GI bleeding as an adverse effect of Amiloride. 

In conclusion, there is limited evidence supporting GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to Amiloride based on the provided drug label sections, and the evidence arises mainly from post-marketing reports with an incidence of 1% or less. The causal relationship between Amiloride and GI bleeding cannot be firmly established from the available data.",NA
gi bleed,aminophylline,,"Based on the provided sections from a drug label, there is no direct evidence explicitly linking gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction to aminophylline. The adverse reactions associated with aminophylline, a derivative of theophylline, detailed in the provided drug label information include mainly caffeine-like effects, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and insomnia when peak serum theophylline concentrations are below 20 mcg/mL. At higher concentrations, adverse reactions can become severe and include persistent vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even potentially fatal outcomes.

The label does mention diarrhea as a reported reaction at serum theophylline concentrations below 20 mcg/mL, but GI bleed is not listed as an observed side effect in the evidence derived from the clinical or post-marketing data provided. While systemic toxicity (manifested in symptoms such as persistent vomiting) could conceivably lead to GI stress, there is no direct causal link or evidence provided to associate aminophylline exposure with GI bleeding as a distinct clinical adverse reaction.

Therefore, it appears that GI bleeding is not recognized as a common or well-documented adverse reaction to aminophylline based on the information from the drug label excerpts you have supplied. For a definitive conclusion, it would be advisable to consult additional sources such as peer-reviewed clinical trials, case studies, and comprehensive reviews of post-marketing surveillance data that might not have been included in your excerpts. If such evidence exists, it was not presented here.","Based on the details provided from the adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings sections of the drug label for aminophylline, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction attributable to aminophylline or its active metabolite theophylline. The listed adverse reactions mainly include caffeine-like side effects (nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia), cardiac arrhythmias, intractable seizures, diarrhea, irritability, restlessness, fine skeletal muscle tremors, transient diuresis, multifocal atrial tachycardia, flutter, and severe allergic skin reactions.

GI bleed is not included among the adverse reactions experienced at various serum theophylline concentrations (<20 mcg/mL or ≥15 mcg/mL) or in cases of theophylline toxicity with concentrations >30 mcg/mL. 

Although there is no explicit evidence within the provided sections of the drug label refuting a relationship between GI bleed and aminophylline use, the absence of this adverse reaction from the detailed list suggests that GI bleed is not a recognized or reported adverse reaction of aminophylline according to the label's safety information. 

NA

This does not preclude the possibility that there might be unpublished case reports or rare instances outside the provided label information where a GI bleed could be associated with aminophylline. Such instances would require further investigation or post-marketing surveillance data to establish any potential causal relationship."
gi bleed,anagrelide,,"Based on the provided drug label information for anagrelide (Agrylin), the evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a potential adverse reaction and drug exposure comes from sections 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience) and 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) of the label.

**Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):**
In the clinical studies mentioned, a total of 942 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms were exposed to anagrelide, experiencing various adverse reactions. While the most common reactions reported (incidence ≥ 5%) did not explicitly include GI bleeding, the less frequent adverse reactions (frequency 1% to < 5%) did include gastrointestinal hemorrhage. This indicates that GI bleeding has been observed in clinical trials, albeit at a lower frequency compared to other side effects.

**Postmarketing Experience (6.2):**
Postmarketing experience, which comprises spontaneous reports and data collected after the drug has been approved and is in use by the general population, also includes gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an adverse reaction. However, because postmarketing reports come from a population of uncertain size and are voluntary, it is difficult to reliably estimate the frequency of this reaction or establish a conclusive causal relationship to anagrelide exposure.

**Warnings and Precautions (5.3 - Bleeding Risk):**
Additionally, under section 5.3 (Bleeding Risk) of the Warnings and Precautions, the label advises practitioners to monitor patients for bleeding. The label particularly cautions when anagrelide is used in conjunction with other drugs known to increase bleeding risk, such as aspirin, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents, indicating a recognized risk of bleeding associated with anagrelide therapy.

In summary, evidence for GI bleed as an adverse reaction to anagrelide comes from both clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance, with gastrointestinal hemorrhage explicitly listed as a less frequent adverse reaction in the product labeling. Additionally, the Warnings and Precautions section of the label acknowledges a bleeding risk associated with anagrelide use. However, the exact frequency and causal relationship in the general patient population remain less clearly defined due to the nature of voluntary reporting in postmarketing surveillance.","NA

The provided drug label information includes ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" listed under the section for adverse reactions with a frequency of 1% to <5%, which indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction of anagrelide. As such, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and drug exposure to anagrelide in the provided sections. It's worth noting that not all potential adverse reactions listed on drug labels or in clinical trials are definitively caused by the drug; they are observed associations. However, the presence of ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" under adverse reactions suggests that there has been at least some evidence to support its occurrence in patients taking anagrelide."
gi bleed,andexanet alfa,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit evidence stated that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is a direct adverse reaction to andexanet alfa. The adverse reactions most commonly reported in subjects receiving andexanet alfa for bleeding were urinary tract infections and pneumonia. Infusion-related reactions were the most common adverse reactions observed in healthy subjects treated with andexanet alfa. Furthermore, thromboembolic events, ischemic events, cardiac arrest, and sudden deaths have been associated with the treatment but these are different from GI bleed.

The ANNEXA-4 study, which is an ongoing multinational trial, involved andexanet alfa being used to reverse anticoagulant therapy in cases of acute major bleeding. The majority of these cases were due to intracranial hemorrhage, with a smaller proportion (26%) due to gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it is important to note that these gastrointestinal bleeds were pre-existing conditions for which andexanet alfa was administered as a treatment to reverse the effects of anticoagulants and not caused by andexanet alfa itself.

No evidence from the provided data suggests that andexanet alfa is responsible for causing GI bleeds. The relationship here is that andexanet alfa is used to counteract the anticoagulation in the context of a GI bleed when it is related to the use of FXa inhibitors, rather than it being an adverse reaction of the drug itself. 

In summary, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no evidence to support GI bleed as an adverse reaction to andexanet alfa. Instead, andexanet alfa is used as a treatment to manage anticoagulation in the event of GI bleeds that occur for other reasons while a patient is on FXa inhibitor therapy.",NA
gi bleed,apixaban,,"The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as an adverse reaction and the exposure to apixaban (marketed as ELIQUIS) is supported by evidence from clinical trials, specifically the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES studies, which included patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

According to the bleed-related adverse events reported in the ARISTOTLE study, there were 128 instances (0.83 episodes per 100 patient-years) of GI bleeding among the 9088 patients treated with apixaban. Comparatively, in the 9052 patients treated with warfarin, there were 141 instances (0.93 episodes per 100 patient-years) of GI bleeding, signifying a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.14). Although the incidence rate of GI bleeding was slightly lower in the apixaban-treated group compared to the warfarin group, the difference was not statistically significant, as indicated by the CI that encompasses 1. 

The AVERROES study also reported GI bleeding events among patients treated with apixaban for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with 45 major bleeding events (1.41% per year) in the 2798 patients on apixaban, although the study directly compared apixaban with aspirin rather than warfarin.

It is important to note that the observed rates of GI bleeding in clinical trials are under conditions of controlled dosing and patient monitoring, which may not reflect the rates observed in broader clinical practice. Post-marketing surveillance could provide additional insight into the frequency and severity of GI bleed in the general population, but such data is not included in the information provided.

The drug label also carries warnings about the risks of bleeding with apixaban and advises on the signs and symptoms of blood loss. It highlights the potential for serious and potentially fatal bleeding events, indicating that while apixaban may have a favorable profile in comparison to traditional therapy (warfarin) in terms of major bleeding events, the risk of GI bleeding remains a concern and requires careful consideration and patient monitoring.

In summary, while the clinical trial evidence does not show a statistically significant increase in GI bleeding risk with apixaban compared to warfarin, the data does establish that GI bleeding is a potential adverse reaction of apixaban treatment. The warnings and precautions section of the drug label underscores the importance of recognizing and managing bleeding risks associated with apixaban therapy.",NA
gi bleed,apixaban,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and drug exposure to apixaban, marketed as ELIQUIS, is derived from clinical trials and the observed rates of bleeding events during these studies. Apixaban is an oral anticoagulant and a direct inhibitor of Factor Xa, which is used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, to treat and reduce the recurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee replacement surgery.

GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to apixaban is documented in the provided drug label sections, which summarize clinical trial findings from ARISTOTLE, AVERROES, AMPLIFY, AMPLIFY-EXT, and other studies. 

In the ARISTOTLE trial, which included 18,201 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (9088 treated with ELIQUIS and 9052 with warfarin), the incidence of major bleeding was 327 events (2.13/100 patient-years) for those treated with ELIQUIS and 462 events (3.09/100 patient-years) for those treated with warfarin. Specifically, GI bleeding occurred in 128 patients (0.83/100 patient-years) on ELIQUIS compared to 141 patients (0.93/100 patient-years) on warfarin, with a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.14).

The AVERROES trial, which compared apixaban with aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable, reported major bleeding events at a rate of 45 (1.41% per year) with apixaban and 29 (0.92% per year) with aspirin, though this difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.45, p=0.07).

In the AMPLIFY study for the treatment of DVT and PE, the incidence of major bleeding in patients treated with ELIQUIS was significantly lower compared to those treated with enoxaparin/warfarin (0.6% vs. 1.8%, respectively; relative risk 0.31, 95% CI [0.17, 0.55], p<0.0001).

Overall, these clinical trials demonstrate that apixaban therapy is associated with bleeding-related adverse reactions, including GI bleeding. The rates of GI bleeding for apixaban as detailed in the ARISTOTLE trial were numerically lower but not statistically different from warfarin, a traditional anticoagulant. It is worth noting that while these trials provide evidence of GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to apixaban, the rates observed should be interpreted with caution as the trials were not intended to directly compare the incidence rates of GI bleeding across different drugs. Treatment with apixaban, like other anticoagulants, carries a risk for bleeding events, and the prescribing information includes detailed warnings and precautions related to the risk of serious bleeding. 

Patients and healthcare providers should remain vigilant for signs of bleeding and consider the benefits and risks of apixaban therapy, especially in individuals with an increased risk of bleeding. Appropriate management strategies, including an agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban, should be readily available to treat emergent bleeding complications.","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label for apixaban (ELIQUIS), which detail the adverse reactions and warnings including bleeding risks, it is clear that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is recognized as a potential adverse reaction associated with apixan usage. The clinical trials ARISTOTLE and AVERROES, referenced in the prescribing information, highlight that GI bleeding events were observed in patients treated with apixaban. As such, there is no available evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and the drug exposure to apixaban; instead, the evidence supports the existence of this adverse reaction."
gi bleed,argatroban,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and drug exposure to argatroban is present in the provided drug label sections, specifically highlighted in the ""Adverse Reactions"" and ""Warnings and Precautions"" segments of the labeling.

From the clinical trial experience with argatroban in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (both with and without thrombosis), there is direct evidence pointing to GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction. The drug label provides the following rates of GI bleeding among argatroban-treated HIT patients in Study 1 and Study 2 compared to historical controls:

- Major GI bleeding occurred in 2.3% of the argatroban-treated patients compared to 1.6% in historical controls.
- Minor GI bleeding was reported in 14.4% of argatroban-treated patients, higher than the 18.1% observed in the historical controls.

The label also includes a separate category for patients at risk for HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Here, the incidence of GI bleeding among argatroban-treated patients was reported to be 0.9% for major hemorrhagic reactions and 2.6% for minor hemorrhagic reactions.

Notably, the ""Risk of Hemorrhage"" section (Warnings and Precautions 5.1) cautions clinicians about the potential for hemorrhage at various body sites, which by inference includes GI bleeding, as a general risk associated with argatroban use. The drug is known to increase bleeding risk especially in certain clinical contexts such as the presence of GI lesions.

Furthermore, the warning also advises on the increased risk of bleeding when argatroban is used concomitantly with other antithrombotic agents, which is relevant as patients with cardiovascular diseases (commonly treated with argatroban) might be on antiplatelet or other anticoagulant therapies.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials as detailed in the drug label suggests that GI bleed is a recognized adverse reaction of argatroban therapy, with both major and minor bleeding events reported. Health care professionals are advised to monitor for signs of hemorrhage and manage the dosing of argatroban carefully, particularly in populations at higher risk or with hepatic impairment. This evidence is primarily derived from the controlled clinical trial data presented in the drug label.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for argatroban, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is documented as both a major and minor hemorrhagic adverse reaction in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) treated with argatroban. The incidence of major GI bleeding was reported to be 2.3% among argatroban-treated patients (Study 1 and Study 2), while minor GI bleeding was reported in 14.4% of these patients. This evidence from clinical trials underscores a direct relationship between argatroban exposure and the occurrence of GI bleeding as an adverse reaction.

Although the evidence in the label clearly supports GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to argatroban, it is important to note that the nature of such evidence summaries may be reliant on the specific patient populations studied, dosing regimens, and study designs, and it may not reflect all potential scenarios in broader patient populations. However, in the absence of any specific evidence refuting the relationship, the evidence provided cannot be disregarded. Therefore, the claim that GI bleed is not an adverse reaction of argatroban is refuted by the clinical trials data presented in the drug label."
gi bleed,arsenic trioxide,,"The provided drug label sections for arsenic trioxide highlight various adverse reactions associated with its use, particularly in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding specifically as an adverse reaction does not appear to be a prominently featured concern in the sections provided.

In the Clinical Trials Experience section under 6.1, adverse reactions related to the gastrointestinal system such as nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are mentioned. Notably, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is reported with an incidence of 8% among the described adverse reactions in Table 5. This suggests an association between GI bleeding and arsenic trioxide exposure in the context of clinical trials. Moreover, in the table, ""Diarrhea hemorrhagic"" is also reported at an incidence of 8%, which could be interpreted as a bleeding complication related to the gastrointestinal tract.

The Postmarketing Experience section 6.2 provides insights into adverse reactions identified after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use. Although several cardiac, hematologic, and systemic adverse reactions are listed here, there is no specific mention of GI bleeding or hemorrhage.

Overall, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that gastrointestinal hemorrhage (including possible hemorrhagic diarrhea) has been reported as an adverse reaction in clinical trials involving arsenic trioxide, although it does not appear to be among the most common or prominently warned-against adverse reactions. It is essential to keep in mind that post-marketing surveillance could reveal additional cases or modify the understanding of the risk, but based on the provided data, it does not seem to be a frequently reported post-marketing event for this drug.

For healthcare providers and patients, it is critical to be aware of this potential risk and to monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding when using arsenic trioxide, as well as to report any such adverse reactions to enhance the database of post-marketing surveillance.",NA
gi bleed,atezolizumab,,"Based on the information provided, there is no direct evidence to support the association between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of atezolizumab. Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ) is not reported in the referenced sections to cause GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction.

Atezolizumab as a single agent or in combination with other antineoplastic agents is associated with other adverse reactions but GI bleeding is not mentioned amongst the most common or severe reactions documented in the clinical trials experience or in the postmarketing experience.

It is possible that GI bleeding is a very rare adverse event or that there is not enough data to establish a causal relationship between atezolizumab and GI bleeding. If such an event arises, it should be reported to the relevant authorities for further investigation as mentioned under ""To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS.""

It is noteworthy that, according to the warnings and precautions section of the label, immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur with the use of atezolizumab, which may affect any organ system. However, no specific mention of GI bleeding is provided. It is recommended to monitor for signs and symptoms of severe adverse reactions across different body systems and manage promptly according to clinical guidelines. 

In conclusion, based on the available information from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance provided, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between GI bleeding and the use of atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ). However, should new evidence emerge, it would need to be evaluated to assess causality.",NA
gi bleed,auranofin,,"The summary of evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a potential adverse reaction and exposure to auranofin (brand name RIDAURA), an oral gold compound indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, is based on clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance as outlined in the drug label information provided.

**Clinical Trials:**
According to the adverse reactions section of the drug label, auranofin has been associated with GI bleeding, although the incidence is relatively low. In a patient population of 4,784 treated with RIDAURA during clinical trials, GI bleeding was observed at a rate less than 1%. Additional GI-related symptoms reported in more than 1% of patients included loose stools or diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea with or without vomiting, among others. However, the association between auranofin treatment and GI bleeding is noted to be uncommon in the provided label information, as indicated by the symbol †, signifying reactions that occurred in 0.1-1% of patients.

**Post-Marketing Experience:**
The same section of the drug label also lists GI bleeding as part of post-marketing experience, suggesting that this adverse reaction has been observed following the drug's approval and widespread use beyond the scope of controlled clinical trials. However, specific incidence rates from post-marketing surveillance are not detailed in the information provided.

**Comparison with Injectable Gold Preparations:**
In the incidence of adverse reactions for specific categories, the comparison is made between RIDAURA and injectable gold. While GI bleeding is not explicitly listed in this comparative data, it is worth noting that auranofin had a lower incidence of proteinuria and stomatitis compared to injectable gold, which may suggest a generally lower incidence of severe adverse reactions.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The drug label's warning section emphasizes that auranofin, like other gold-containing drugs, can lead to gold toxicity, and it outlines several signs of this, including hematological abnormalities and renal issues, but it does not explicitly mention GI bleeding in this section.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance provided in the drug label demonstrates an observed association between GI bleeding and auranofin exposure among a small percentage of patients. However, the exact frequency or a clear causal relationship is not detailed beyond this observation. As always, it is crucial to monitor patients regularly for signs of adverse reactions, as recommended in the precautions section of the drug label.

**Sources:**
The evidence summary provided is based on the drug label sections for RIDAURA detailing adverse reactions, post-marketing experience, and comparative trials with injectable gold. This summary does not include research or data beyond what is presented in the drug label information provided.",NA
gi bleed,avapritinib,,"Evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and avapritinib exposure can be derived from the safety data presented in the clinical trial experiences section of the drug label.

In the section detailing the clinical trials experience for unresectable or metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST), GI hemorrhage was reported as a serious adverse reaction. Specifically, among patients receiving avapritinib, GI hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Additionally, in the Warnings and Precautions, it is noted that serious intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 2.9% of the 749 patients with GIST or Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (AdvSM) in clinical trials, and it is mentioned that gastrointestinal hemorrhage was one of the serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients who received avapritinib.

In the context of Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (AdvSM), it appears that avapritinib treatment at various doses led to occurrences of different types of bleeding, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal bleeding was part of the serious adverse reactions catalogued, although specific percentages for GI bleed are not given in this section. Subdural hematoma, which is a form of bleeding, is mentioned multiple times, suggesting a recognized risk for hemorrhagic events.

Post-marketing surveillance data, case studies, or specific incidence rates derived from dedicated safety studies on avapritinib-induced GI bleeding are not cited within the provided drug label sections. Therefore, while detailed post-marketing surveillance data is not provided, the clinical trials' data included in the sections pointing towards a relationship between avapritinib exposure and GI bleeding should be considered relevant, albeit the exact incidence of GI bleeding specific to the drug is not disclosed.

It is important to note that individuals with a history of risk factors for intracranial bleeding or hemorrhage are mentioned as being excluded from the clinical trials or subject to monitoring-related precautions, indicating an identified risk associated with the drug. This acknowledged risk further supports the evidence linking avapritinib to hemorrhagic adverse reactions, including potential GI bleed.

The drug label recommends close monitoring of patients for symptoms of bleeding and provides guidance for the management of hemorrhagic events, indicating that the relationship between avapritinib and adverse bleeding events, including gastrointestinal bleeding, is taken seriously in clinical management.

In conclusion, clinical trial data from the drug label for avapritinib demonstrates a recognized risk of hemorrhagic adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal bleeding, in patients treated with the drug, with specific instances and related management strategies outlined in the safety information.",NA
gi bleed,azacitidine,,"Based on the provided sections of the azacitidine drug label, gastrointestinal bleeding, including events like gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena, has been reported as an adverse reaction, albeit at a rate of less than 5%. This information can be found in the ""Clinical Trials Experience"" section under the list of serious adverse reactions not described in the previous tables (Table 2 or 3), indicating that gastrointestinal bleeding is not a common adverse reaction in the treated patient population, but it has occurred.

Additionally, in the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is again noted, but there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding specifically corresponding to GI bleed as a defined medical condition such as peptic ulcer bleed or diverticular bleed.

To be concise, there is evidence to suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding can occur as an adverse reaction to azacitidine based on clinical trial data and post-marketing reports. However, this adverse effect is rare, and the available information does not specify the frequency or the conditions under which such bleeding typically occurs.

The evidence comes from the reports of adverse reactions noted in clinical trial participants as well as incidents reported after the drug's approval during post-marketing surveillance, which often includes a broader population and can reveal additional side effects not detected in clinical trials due to the larger and more varied sample of patients. The drug label does not provide specific details about case studies or the context of clinical trials that reported GI bleeding as an adverse reaction, nor does it suggest any particular predisposing factors.",NA
gi bleed,aztreonam,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label of aztreanom, there is mention of rare cases of gastrointestinal bleeding including the adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. This information falls under the Gastrointestinal category of systemic adverse reactions that have an incidence of less than 1%. It states that rare cases of C. difficile–associated diarrhea, which can include pseudomembranous colitis or gastrointestinal bleeding, have been reported. The onset of such symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment, as indicated in the WARNINGS section of the label.

While the specific incidence of GI bleeding is not quantified beyond being a rare occurrence, the label's inclusion of gastrointestinal bleeding does suggest that such events have been observed and are considered to be potentially related to aztreanom exposure. However, the absence of detailed statistical data or specific case studies provided means that the evidence for a definitive causal relationship is limited to post-marketing surveillance reports, which generally have a lower level of evidence when compared to controlled clinical trials.

Therefore, the evidence presented on the drug label indicates a recognition of GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction to aztreanom, albeit as a rare event, based on post-marketing experience and reports. Due to the low incidence and the nature of post-marketing reports, which may not be as rigorously controlled as clinical trial data, causation may not be firmly established. Additional sources, such as case studies or large-scale observational studies, would be needed to better characterize the relationship between aztreanom and GI bleed.

In summary, there is some acknowledgement of the relationship between GI bleed and aztreanom exposure from post-marketing surveillance as indicated in the drug label, but without more specific data or controlled studies, the evidence is limited.",NA
gi bleed,baclofen,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, there is no direct evidence that specifically lists gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a known adverse reaction of baclofen. The adverse reactions section does mention gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and the occurrence of a positive test for occult blood in stool. The positive test for occult blood in stool could suggest the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding, but this does not alone confirm GI bleeding as a direct adverse reaction to baclofen.

It is important to note that the labeling indicates these symptoms can be rare, and there are no percentages assigned to the positive test for occult blood in stool, which suggests it is not among the more common adverse reactions. No explicit information about GI bleeding as an adverse event, such as a case study, clinical trial data, or post-marketing surveillance data, has been provided.

In the absence of specific evidence linking baclofen to GI bleed directly, we cannot firmly conclude there is a relationship. The presence of GI symptoms in the adverse reactions could warrant further investigation. Clinicians prescribing baclofen should use their clinical judgment considering the patient's overall medical history and concomitant medication when assessing the risk of GI bleeding or any adverse effects. If more detailed information from research studies or case reports becomes available, it could provide a clearer understanding of the potential risk of GI bleed with baclofen use.",NA
gi bleed,basiliximab,,"After reviewing the relevant sections of the drug label for Simulect® (basiliximab), the evidence suggests that gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) is a potential adverse reaction associated with the drug, albeit with a low incidence. Specifically:

1. **Clinical Trials**: In the controlled clinical trials mentioned in the drug label, GI hemorrhage is listed among adverse events that occurred with an incidence of ≥3% and <10%. This data is derived from the pooled analysis of patients treated with basiliximab across four controlled clinical trials. It's important to note that these trials included patients on dual maintenance immunosuppressive regimens (cyclosporine, steroids) and triple-immunosuppressive regimens (cyclosporine, steroids, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil).

2. **Comparative Incidence**: The drug label indicates that the incidence and types of adverse events, including gastrointestinal disorders, were similar in Simulect-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. This suggests that while GI bleed is identified as a potential adverse event, its incidence may not be significantly higher than that seen with placebo, at least according to the aggregated data from clinical trials.

3. **Postmarketing Surveillance**: There is no specific mention of GI bleed as an adverse reaction in the postmarketing experience section of the label. The postmarketing experience primarily reports severe acute hypersensitivity reactions.

In summary, gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been documented as an adverse event in clinical trials of basiliximab with a low incidence rate (between 3% and 10%). However, given the similar incidence rate to placebo and the lack of specific mention in the postmarketing surveillance data, the evidence linking basiliximab to GI bleed is not strongly characterized by the available data in the label. It is possible that this adverse reaction could be more related to the underlying disease, concurrent administration of other immunosuppressants, or the overall condition of organ transplantation patients rather than to basiliximab alone. 

Physicians prescribing Simulect should be experienced in immunosuppression therapy and organ transplantation management and must consider the overall risk-benefit profile of the drug in the context of each individual patient's treatment plan.","NA

The evidence provided in the drug label for Simulect® (basiliximab) does not refute the relationship between GI bleed and the drug exposure because GI hemorrhage, which is relevant to GI bleed, is explicitly listed among the gastrointestinal adverse events reported with an incidence of ≥ 3% and < 10% in the controlled clinical trials. Although the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was similar between the Simulect-treated patients and the placebo-treated patients, GI hemorrhage was still observed within the treatment group.
"
gi bleed,bevacizumab,,"Evidence supports the association between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, including gastrointestinal perforation, and the use of bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic therapy targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The potential for this adverse reaction is recognized in the drug's label and clinical trial data, as detailed below:

1. **Clinical Trial Data**:
   - Certain clinical trials cited in the drug label report hemorrhage as an observed adverse reaction in patients treated with bevacizumab, noting its occurrence at a rate >10%. For example, the label mentions hemorrhage rates of 5% vs. 1% in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone in a colorectal cancer study (E3200).
   - In metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with bevacizumab (Study BO17705), the drug label acknowledges a higher incidence of hemorrhage (3% vs. 0.3% with the inclusion of various GI bleeding incidents such as small intestinal hemorrhage and large intestinal hemorrhage).

2. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   - As per the 'Warnings and Precautions' section of the drug label (5.3), bevacizumab products can result in serious hemorrhage, including potential GI bleeding. While the label focuses on rare but severe or fatal hemorrhages, it does highlight that the risk of hemorrhage is greater in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to those receiving only chemotherapy.

3. **Post-Marketing Experience**:
   - The labeling further acknowledges post-marketing reports that identify incidences of gastrointestinal ulcer and intestinal necrosis, suggesting that some post-marketing observations of adverse events may include GI bleed.

While the evidence provided from the drug label does not clearly define the rate of GI bleeding as a distinct category separate from overall hemorrhage rates, it does acknowledge the occurrence of serious and sometimes fatal hemorrhages, which may include GI bleeds. Clinical trials and post-marketing experiences show an increased incidence of GI-related adverse events, including hemorrhage, in patients receiving bevacizumab.

In conclusion, clinical trial data, drug labeling, and post-marketing surveillance underscore a relationship between the use of bevacizumab and the adverse reaction of GI bleeding. Health care providers are advised to closely monitor patients for signs of GI bleeding and other hemorrhagic events during bevacizumab treatment.",NA
gi bleed,binimetinib,,"Based on the provided drug label sections relevant to adverse reactions and warnings, there is evidence to support the relationship between gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) and drug exposure to binimetinib, which is often used in combination with encorafenib. Here are the key points drawn from the clinical trials and warnings:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - The COLUMBUS trial, which studied 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, described adverse reactions to MEKTOVI (binimetinib) when administered with encorafenib. Hemorrhage was reported in 19% of patients treated with this combination, with grade 4 adverse reactions specifically including hemorrhage (n=3) [Section 6.1].
   - In the PHAROS trial, involving 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, hemorrhage was noted as a serious adverse reaction occurring in 12% of patients receiving the combination, with one fatal instance of intracranial hemorrhage reported as well [Section 6.1].

2. Hemorrhage Warning:
   - Section 5.8 directly addresses the occurrence of hemorrhage as an adverse reaction when MEKTOVI is administered with encorafenib. It highlights that 19% of patients in the COLUMBUS trial experienced hemorrhage, which included various types of GI bleeding such as rectal and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage. It also notes that fatal intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.6% of patients in the context of new or progressive brain metastases.
   - In the PHAROS trial, hemorrhage occurred in 12% of patients and included Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic events, among them anal hemorrhage and hemothorax.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - No specific references to GI bleeds related to binimetinib from post-marketing surveillance have been provided in the summary.

In conclusion, evidence from the clinical trials, specifically the COLUMBUS and PHAROS trials mentioned in the drug label, supports GI bleed as an adverse reaction associated with binimetinib, especially when used in combination with encorafenib. It should be noted that adverse reactions leading to GI bleeds can be severe and, in some cases, fatal. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to monitor patients closely for signs of GI bleed during treatment with this drug combination.","Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence to suggest that hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal events, is a recognized and documented adverse reaction associated with the use of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib. In clinical trials, such as the COLUMBUS trial, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving binimetinib in combination with encorafenib (Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients), with rectal hemorrhage, hematochezia, and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage being some of the hemorrhagic events reported.

Regarding the specific concern about gastrointestinal bleeding, although the label does not itemize ""GI bleed"" in the list of hemorrhagic events, given that rectal hemorrhage and hematochezia are types of GI bleeding, it can be inferred that GI bleeding is encompassed within the broader category of hemorrhage documented as an adverse reaction to binimetinib when used with encorafenib.

Therefore, it is not accurate to state that there is evidence refuting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and drug exposure to binimetinib; instead, the evidence indicates that hemorrhagic events, which can include GI bleeding, are associated adverse reactions of binimetinib when used in combination therapy.

NA (Not applicable) would not be the correct response in this context as there is documented evidence of a relationship between hemorrhagic adverse reactions and binimetinib in combination with encorafenib."
gi bleed,bortezomib,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bortezomib is derived from postmarketing surveillance as well as clinical trials. Here is a concise summary of the available data:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Peripheral Neuropathy, hypotension, cardiac toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, thrombocytopenia/neutropenia, and other toxicities were reported.
- Adverse reactions like nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, neuralgia, anemia, leukopenia, vomiting, and constipation were commonly observed (incidence ≥20%).
- Although GI adverse events such as diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting are mentioned, GI bleeding is not specifically noted as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial summaries provided.

Warnings and Precautions Section:
- The label highlights important precautions and potential serious adverse events.
- Gastrointestinal Toxicity (5.6) is mentioned, which indicates that symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting may require antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications or fluid replacement. However, this section does not explicitly state GI bleeding as an expected toxicity.

Postmarketing Experience:
- While the clinical trial data provided does not specify GI bleed, the Postmarketing Experience section (6.2) lists ischemic colitis, which is a condition that can potentially lead to GI bleeding.
- Postmarketing surveillance yields a broader scope of potential adverse reactions due to a larger, more diverse patient population and longer drug exposure timeframes. It's important to consider that these events are voluntarily reported.

Based on the data presented:

- GI bleeding (specifically ischemic colitis) has been identified as an adverse reaction in the postmarketing setting.
- There is no direct mention of GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial summaries provided for this request.
- Postmarketing reports can suggest a broader range of rare but potentially serious side effects that may not have been fully captured during clinical trials due to the smaller numbers and shorter duration of follow-up.

The evidence suggests that while GI bleeding might not be a prominent adverse effect identified in the clinical trials data provided, ischemic colitis as a cause of GI bleeding has been noted in postmarketing surveillance, underlining the importance of this surveillance system in identifying rare adverse drug reactions. It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of and monitor for symptoms of GI bleeding during bortezomib therapy. 

Please note that the warning sections and adverse reactions provided are not exhaustive and only represent selected excerpts from the label for the context of GI bleeding. Healthcare professionals should review the full product labeling for a comprehensive understanding of the safety profile of bortezomib.",NA
gi bleed,bosutinib,,"Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experience provided in the drug label sections given, gastrointestinal bleeding is recognized as a possible adverse event associated with the use of bosutinib, which is indicated for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The information provided lists ""gastrointestinal toxicity"" as a clinically significant adverse reaction discussed in other sections of the labelling. This category includes phenomena like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (section 6.1), and it is mentioned in the Warnings and Precautions (5.1) section that gastrointestinal symptoms should be monitored and managed using standards of care.

Notably, under the heading ""Gastrointestinal Disorders,"" gastrointestinal hemorrhage is documented as an adverse reaction that occurred in less than 10% of bosutinib-treated patients. The hemorrhage spectrum encompasses various types of bleeding, including gastric hemorrhage (section 6, Additional Adverse Reactions From Multiple Clinical Trials). Additionally, one fatal adverse reaction due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage is specifically acknowledged in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy (section 6, Adverse Reactions in Patients With Imatinib-Resistant or -Intolerant Ph+ CP, AP, and BP CML).

Postmarketing Experience:
Postmarketing surveillance further corroborates these findings, as gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed in the ""Gastrointestinal Disorders"" category. This reporting implies that cases of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with bosutinib have been observed after the drug was approved and made widely available, providing real-world evidence of this potential adverse reaction (section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience).

In summary, although gastrointestinal bleeding is not prominently highlighted as the most common adverse effect, clinical trial evidence and postmarketing reporting suggest a relationship between bosutinib treatment and the development of gastrointestinal bleeding in some patients. Health professionals should monitor patients on bosutinib for signs of gastrointestinal toxicity and manage according to the standard of care, potentially including dosage adjustments or discontinuation of the drug.",NA
gi bleed,bosutinib,,"**Evidence Summary:**
Bosutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including the potential for gastrointestinal bleeding. While the provided label sections do not explicitly list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction, they do indicate that gastrointestinal toxicity, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur with Bosutinib treatment. 

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
From clinical trials in adults with newly diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or with resistance/intolerance to previous therapy, the most common adverse reactions in ≥20% of adults (N=814) included diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. No explicit mention of GI bleed is noted.

**Serious Adverse Reactions & Postmarketing Experience:**
It is reported that serious adverse reactions included gastrointestinal events, with gastroenteritis listed among them for patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase CML. Additionally, in the postmarketing experience, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which may encompass GI bleed, is listed as an adverse reaction reported in less than 10% of Bosutinib-treated patients. This suggests that while GI bleed may not be a common adverse reaction, it has occurred during patient treatment with Bosutinib and has been reported post-marketing.

**Boxed Warnings and Other Warnings/Precautions:**
The warnings and precautions section advises monitoring for gastrointestinal toxicity and managing accordingly. This can imply that serious GI effects, including GI bleed, are a concern and healthcare professionals should vigilantly monitor for it.

**Pediatric Experience:**
Similar gastrointestinal adverse reactions are noted in the pediatric population, including diarrhea and abdominal pain.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence extracted from the drug label indicates that while gastrointestinal toxicity is a known adverse reaction of Bosutinib therapy, GI bleed is not explicitly listed among the most common events. However, postmarketing, gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported, suggesting a potential link between Bosutinib and GI bleed. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor for gastrointestinal toxicity and manage symptoms as appropriate. Conclusive evidence directly associating Bosutinib with GI bleed is not strongly emphasized in the label but can be inferred from general GI toxicity and post-marketing reports.

**Recommendation:**
Clinicians should closely monitor patients on Bosutinib for signs of gastrointestinal toxicity, including symptoms that may suggest GI bleeding. Prompt management and intervention should be applied as necessary. Further post-marketing surveillance and reporting may provide additional data on the incidence and characteristics of GI bleed associated with Bosutinib.",NA
gi bleed,bromocriptine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections—ADVERSE REACTIONS, WARNINGS, and BOX WARNINGS—the evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and bromocriptine use (marketed as Parlodel) includes reporting from clinical trials and post-marketing experience.

From clinical trials in patients treated with Parlodel for hyperprolactinemic indications and acromegaly, gastrointestinal bleeding was noted as a less frequent adverse reaction (less than 2%). The trials for Parkinson's Disease did not mention GI bleeding specifically. The occurrence of GI bleeding as an acknowledged adverse event in clinical trials supports a potential relationship between Bromocriptine exposure and GI bleed, but it appears to be an infrequent event.

From the post-marketing experience, gastrointestinal ulcer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are listed among the adverse reactions reported. However, it is important to note that the frequency of these events and the establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure are difficult because post-marketing reports are voluntarily submitted from a population of uncertain size, without a control group for comparison.

No box warnings regarding GI bleed associated with Bromocriptine have been mentioned, indicating that this adverse reaction is not considered a severe risk that requires such a prominent warning.

In conclusion, given that gastrointestinal bleeding is specifically listed as a less frequent adverse reaction in clinical trials and as a reported event in post-marking surveillance, there is some evidence to support the relationship between GI bleed and Bromocriptine use. However, due to the low frequency of these reports and the limitations in establishing causality from post-marketing data, the evidence should be considered limited. Health professionals should monitor for this potential adverse effect during treatment with Bromocriptine, and patients should be advised to report any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as dark stools or abdominal pain.",NA
gi bleed,bupropion,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for bupropion hydrochloride tablets, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
The clinical trials section provides a detailed list of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials but does not include GI bleed. Adverse reactions that led to the discontinuation of treatment with bupropion were mostly neuropsychiatric disturbances, gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea and vomiting), neurological disturbances, and dermatologic problems, but GI bleed was not specified.

Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
In the postmarketing experience, which captures adverse reactions identified during postapproval use of the drug, various adverse gastrointestinal events such as esophagitis and hepatitis are mentioned. However, GI bleed is not explicitly listed. Although there is an observation of ""altered PT and/or INR, infrequently associated with hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications,"" this is noted when bupropion is coadministered with warfarin, which is known to affect coagulation and bleeding risk.

Warnings and Precautions (Sections 5):
The Warnings and Precautions sections discuss various risks related to bupropion use, including neuropsychiatric adverse events, seizure risk, hypertension, activation of mania/hypomania, psychosis and other neuropsychiatric reactions, angle-closure glaucoma, and hypersensitivity reactions. None of these sections mention GI bleed as an identified risk or adverse event associated with bupropion use.

Based on the evidence provided from the drug label, which includes summaries of clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance, and detailed consideration of adverse reactions, there is no known evidence that directly supports a relationship between GI bleed and bupropion exposure. If GI bleed is a concern or observed clinically, it may warrant further investigation but is not currently recognized as an established adverse reaction attributed to bupropion in the given sections of the drug label.",NA
gi bleed,busulfan,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for Busulfan (including ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS"", ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"", ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"", ""6.3 Oral Busulfan Literature Review"", and ""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS""), there is no direct mention or clear association between Busulfan exposure and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction. The provided sections list various side effects and complications related to different organ systems; however, a GI bleed is not specified in this context.

The adverse reactions section (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) and the summary tables delineate a broad range of both hematologic and non-hematologic side effects, with gastrointestinal system reactions such as nausea, stomatitis (mucositis), vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain being very commonly observed. Additionally, there are mentions of other gastrointestinal issues such as esophagitis, ileus, and pancreatitis. Still, it is essential to note that these findings do not directly report a GI bleed as an adverse reaction to Busulfan.

In postmarketing experience (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), there is also no specific mention of GI bleed as a recognized adverse reaction. Postmarketing surveillance data can sometimes reveal rare or delayed adverse reactions not identified in clinical trials; however, in the context of Busulfan, this complication is not cited.

Furthermore, the oral Busulfan literature review (6.3 Oral Busulfan Literature Review), summarizing safety outcomes from randomized controlled trials, does not include GI bleed as an identified safety issue within the trials reviewed.

It is always possible that individual case reports or smaller studies outside of the conventional clinical trial and post-marketing frameworks might cite GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction to Busulfan, but based on the given drug label excerpts, there is no available evidence within these sources to establish a definitive link between GI bleed and Busulfan.

Clinicians should remain vigilant for any signs of GI bleeding in patients taking Busulfan due to its general effects on the GI tract and the potential for complications related to mucositis or other issues that could theoretically lead to bleeding. Patients should be monitored closely, and any new symptoms or adverse reactions should be reported to health authorities as part of ongoing pharmacovigilance efforts.",NA
gi bleed,caffeine,,"Based on the information provided, evidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction to caffeine citrate (CAFCIT) comes from a limited number of cases in a controlled trial. Specifically, in the double-blind period of the controlled trial mentioned, there was one instance (2.2%) of gastrointestinal hemorrhage reported in the caffeine-treated group (N=46), whereas no instances were reported in the placebo group (N=39). This suggests a possible association between caffeine citrate exposure and GI bleed; however, the association is weak due to the very small number of incidents.

The adverse events table does not mention GI bleed as a common adverse reaction but does list gastrointestinal hemorrhage in one patient treated with CAFCIT. The available case from the double-blind period does not establish a causative relationship but rather indicates a potential adverse event that occurred at a higher frequency in the CAFCIT-treated patients compared to placebo during that period.

Furthermore, the published literature referenced provides no concrete evidence supporting GI bleed as a consistent adverse reaction to caffeine. It does describe gastrointestinal effects such as increased gastric aspirate and gastrointestinal intolerance, but no direct correlation to GI bleed is clearly indicated.

The mentioned clinical trial, NCT00182312, studied the safety of caffeine citrate primarily concerning apnea in premature infants and found no significant increase in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis—a severe gastrointestinal condition that could theoretically lead to GI bleed—compared to the placebo. Additionally, it did not find an increase in adverse outcomes, including GI bleed, prior to discharge or at long-term follow-up.

In conclusion, the evidence suggesting a relationship between caffeine exposure and GI bleed is not robust and is based on a very limited number of incidents in a controlled trial setting. There is no widespread reported evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that strongly supports the existence of this adverse reaction. While a single instance was observed in a controlled study, the existing data are insufficient to definitively establish a causal link between caffeine exposure and GI bleed. More comprehensive research would be required to validate this potential adverse reaction.","Based on the provided drug label sections for CAFCIT (caffeine citrate), gastrointestinal hemorrhage was reported as an adverse event in 1 (2.2%) of the patients treated with caffeine citrate compared to 0 (0.0%) in the placebo group during the double-blind therapy phase of a controlled trial. This suggests that during this particular controlled clinical trial, gastrointestinal hemorrhage was observed in a small number of patients receiving caffeine.

However, the provided sections also mention that a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT00182312) studying caffeine citrate in premature infants with apnea of prematurity did not report gastrointestinal hemorrhage or necrotizing enterocolitis as more common in the caffeine citrate group compared to the placebo group prior to discharge home. Additionally, long-term follow-up studies have not demonstrated that caffeine adversely affects neurological development or growth parameters.

In conclusion, the evidence refuting a direct relationship between caffeine exposure and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding appears to be supported by a large clinical trial (NCT00182312), which did not find a significantly increased incidence of GI bleed or related conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis associated with caffeine citrate use compared to placebo. However, this does not fully exclude the possibility of such an adverse event as it was reported in a smaller controlled trial, albeit infrequently. Therefore, while there is some evidence suggesting a potential association, larger-scale data and long-term follow-up do not support an increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with caffeine citrate use in the specific population of premature infants with apnea of prematurity."
gi bleed,capecitabine,,"Evidence from Clinical Trials:

Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate, is routinely used in the treatment of various cancers, including colorectal and breast cancers. In several clinical trials outlined in the drug label, such as the X-ACT trial for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer and Study SO14999 for metastatic breast cancer, common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with capecitabine include gastrointestinal disturbances (such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and abdominal pain), hand-and-foot syndrome (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia Syndrome), fatigue, hyperbilirubinemia, and hematological abnormalities like anemia and lymphopenia.

Regarding gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) specifically as an adverse event, there is no direct mention of GI bleed as a common adverse reaction within the clinical trial data sections provided. However, there is a mention of ""gastrointestinal motility disorder"" and ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" occurring in less than 10% of patients within the pooled safety information for metastatic colorectal cancer patients. This indicates that while GI bleed may not be amongst the most common adverse reactions, there is some evidence from clinical trials that it could occur as a less frequent side effect of capecitabine treatment.

Postmarketing Experience:

In the post-marketing experience section of the drug label, various adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of capecitabine due to voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size. It is important to note that these observations are not as systematically collected as those in clinical trials and may not be as reliable for establishing cause-and-effect relationships. Within this section, there is no specific mention of GI bleed as an identified adverse event.

Conclusion:

Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance as described in the drug label, GI bleed is identified as a possible but less common adverse reaction to capecitabine, with ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" reported in the clinical trials section under less frequent events. It is worth considering that GI bleed as a broader category could encompass various specific gastrointestinal complaints and may not always be reported in the same terminology.

As with any adverse drug reaction, healthcare providers should monitor patients on capecitabine for signs of GI bleeding and manage according to standard clinical practice, considering the potential severity of such events. It’s essential for healthcare professionals to report any suspicion of adverse reactions to regulatory agencies to contribute to post-marketing surveillance and improve the understanding of a drug's safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,carbidopa,,"Based on the provided drug label information for carbidopa, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is listed among the adverse reactions that have been reported with carbidopa-levodopa combination products. This adverse reaction is mentioned under the gastrointestinal section which includes ""gastrointestinal bleeding"" alongside other gastrointestinal-related issues.

However, the drug label specifies that the adverse reactions observed were in conjunction with the concomitant use of carbidopa with other drugs, such as levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products. There is no direct statement in the label that carbidopa alone has been observed to cause GI bleeding.

While the association between carbidopa and GI bleed is mentioned, the drug label does not explicitly establish a casual relationship for carbidopa alone in the development of this adverse event. Furthermore, the label does not provide details regarding the incidence, severity, or the specific clinical trial data that led to the inclusion of GI bleed as an adverse reaction. It is also notable that GI bleed is a recognized complication with the use of levodopa, which is commonly prescribed in combination with carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

In the absence of specific clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance information solely related to carbidopa's association with GI bleed, the evidence for such a relationship appears to be related to its combined use with other medications, particularly levodopa.

In summary, while gastrointestinal bleeding is listed as an adverse reaction in the context of carbidopa's use with other drugs, there is no clear evidence provided in the drug label that carbidopa alone is responsible for this adverse event. Precise evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that exclusively implicates carbidopa in causing GI bleed is not presented in the provided information.",NA
gi bleed,carboprost,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction of carboprost tromethamine. The adverse reactions listed are largely associated with the drug's effect on smooth muscle contraction, with effects such as vomiting and diarrhea being the most frequently observed. Although ""hematemesis"" (vomiting of blood) is listed, this term is not synonymous with a GI bleed but rather indicates that bleeding might be occurring in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

However, the absence of a clear mention of GI bleeding in these sections does not necessarily mean that there is no risk or that no evidence exists; it simply may not be among the most commonly reported or recognized adverse reactions. The presence of adverse effects like hematemesis and epigastric pain could suggest a possible association with GI bleeding, which could be further investigated through a thorough search of additional clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance reports beyond the label information.

It is important to note that the occurrence of adverse reactions such as vomiting and diarrhea does not directly establish that carboprost causes GI bleeding, but it may contribute indirectly to such an event in certain predisposed individuals or under specific conditions.

To obtain a definitive statement regarding the relationship between carboprost exposure and GI bleeding, one would need a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, clinical trial data, and post-marketing surveillance that includes a detailed analysis of reported cases and their causality assessment. Without such a review, a conclusive summary cannot be provided here.

In the absence of clear evidence specifically linking carboprost to GI bleeding within the provided label sections, healthcare providers should continue to monitor patients for any signs of adverse reactions and consider all possible side effects when assessing patient risk. If a formal evaluation of the potential link between carboprost and GI bleed is required, an in-depth analysis of broader pharmacovigilance data and literature would be necessary.","NA
"
gi bleed,carfilzomib,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for carfilzomib (Kyprolis), there is mention of hemorrhage as a potential adverse reaction, which includes gastrointestinal hemorrhage:

- Within the ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" section (5.10), it is indicated that ""Fatal or serious cases of hemorrhage have been reported in patients treated with Kyprolis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hemorrhagic events have included gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial hemorrhage and epistaxis.""

- Additionally, in the ""Adverse Reactions"" section under ""Adverse Reactions Occurring at a Frequency of < 20%,"" gastrointestinal disorders are listed and include gastrointestinal hemorrhage as one of the adverse reactions observed.

- The ""Clinical Trials Experience"" detailed in the label provides extensive information on various adverse reactions from clinical trials of Kyprolis, but explicit data specific to gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) incidence is not provided within the provided text.

Therefore, while the label mentions hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, as an adverse reaction observed with carfilzomib use, specific evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance regarding the incidence rate or relative risk of this adverse event compared to the baseline or other therapies is not detailed within the provided sections.

Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the Amgen Medical Information or the FDA, indicating a mechanism of post-marketing surveillance. Clinical context and individual patient assessments are crucial for evaluating the risks of GI bleed in patients receiving carfilzomib.

For the most precise and personalized risk assessment of GI bleed associated with carfilzomib in a specific patient, it would be necessary to consult the full prescribing information, including sections dedicated to study data and post-marketing reports, along with the evaluation of individual patient factors and comorbidities.",NA
gi bleed,carfilzomib,,"Based on the extensive information provided, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction to carfilzomib. However, hemorrhage is listed as a potential adverse reaction under Warnings and Precautions (5.10) in the prescribing information for Kyprolis (the brand name for carfilzomib). It states that fatal or serious cases of hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial hemorrhage and epistaxis, have been reported.

The clinical trials experience detailed in the prescribing information (6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) does not include GI bleeding or hemorrhage as one of the most common adverse reactions in the pooled safety population or in the listed clinical trials (ASPIRE, ENDEAVOR, A.R.R.O.W., CANDOR, EQUULEUS, and PLEIADES). Instead, the most common adverse reactions include anemia, diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, cough, and dyspnea.

The statement in section “Gastrointestinal disorders” of Table 19 under “Kyprolis in Patients who Received Monotherapy” indicates gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an adverse reaction occurring at a frequency of less than 20% during monotherapy.

As for case studies and post-marketing surveillance, no specific instances or studies have been mentioned in the information provided; thus, it is unclear whether cases of GI bleeding have been observed and reported through these channels.

In summary, while GI bleeding is not highlighted as a common adverse reaction in the provided clinical trial data, it is recognized as a serious potential hemorrhagic event within the Warnings and Precautions section of the carfilzomlet label. Any suspected relationship between carfilzomib exposure and GI bleeding would require careful evaluation of individual case reports and consider the overall clinical context, as these events can be multifactorial in a patient population that commonly experiences coagulopathies and receives multiple concomitant medications.",NA
gi bleed,carvedilol,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for carvedilol, the evidence supporting a relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and carvedilol use is not directly reported in the adverse reactions (section 6), clinical study experiences (section 6.1), or postmarketing experience (section 6.2). 

The most common adverse reactions reported with carvedilol in clinical trials, as specified in section 6.1, include dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, asthenia, bradycardia, and weight increase for heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction patients, as well as dizziness for hypertension patients. Gastrointestinal adverse events such as diarrhea are mentioned, but GI bleed is not listed among them.

In the detail of gastrointestinal adverse events provided in section 6.1, carvedilol is associated with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and melena (dark, tarry stools that can indicate GI bleeding), but a specific and direct causal relationship to GI bleed is not established based on this label information.

Section 6.2, discussing postmarketing experience, does not list GI bleed as an identified adverse reaction during the post-approval use of carvedilol. An adverse reaction of GI hemorrhage is mentioned under a list of events reported at a very low incidence (≤0.1% of subjects), which indicates that if there is a potential link between carvedilol and GI bleeds, it is extremely rare based on the current postmarketing data.

In summary, there is no clear evidence in the provided drug label sections of carvedilol that establishes GI bleed as a common adverse reaction associated with carvedilol use. While melena is noted, which can be a sign of GI bleeding, this symptom is not synonymous with GI bleed, and its occurrence does not support a definitive relationship. Postmarketing data do not prominently feature GI bleed as a reported adverse event, suggesting that if such a risk exists, it is likely very low or not well-documented in the context of carvedilol's postmarketing surveillance. 

For healthcare providers or patients concerned about this potential risk, it would be advisable to consult the full prescribing information for a more detailed assessment or to review additional medical literature or reporting databases for any further reported cases or studies exploring this relationship.",NA
gi bleed,celecoxib,,"Based on the provided drug label information for celecoxib, evidence supports that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a potential adverse reaction to its use.

Clinical Trials Experience:
- Adverse events relating to the GI system were reported in controlled arthritis trials, including abdominal pain (4.1%), diarrhea (5.6%), and dyspepsia (8.8%).
- Other adverse GI events occurred in 0.1% to 1.9% of patients treated with celecoxib, including constipation, diverticulitis, and gastroenteritis, among others.
- Serious GI adverse events, such as intestinal perforation and GI bleeding, were noted as occurring in less than 0.1% of patients.

Warnings and Precautions:
- The label warns that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like celecoxib have an increased risk of serious GI adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, which can be fatal.
- Even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk for serious GI events.
- Factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in NSAID-treated patients include long NSAID therapy duration, the use of other drugs that enhance bleeding risk (such as corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and SSRIs), smoking, alcohol use, older age, and poor general health status.

Postmarketing Experience:
- Postmarketing reports, which involve a larger and more diverse patient population, also acknowledge GI bleeding and ulceration as adverse reactions.

Considering the evidence from the clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance, and the drug warnings and precautions sections of the label, there is a clear relationship between celecoxib use and the risk of GI bleeding. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of this risk, to inform their patients, and to monitor for signs of GI bleeding, particularly in individuals with known risk factors for such events.","NA

The information provided from the drug label specifies that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is indeed a known possible adverse reaction to celecoxib. The sections related to adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings all recognize the risk of serious GI events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestances, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use, with or without warning symptoms, particularly in patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who are at greater risk.

This information is supported by data from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences, making it clear that there is a known association between celecoxib and the potential for gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, no evidence is presented that refutes the relationship between GI bleed and celecoxib exposure, as such evidence is not consistent with the recognized profile of the drug."
gi bleed,cevimeline,,"The provided drug label information for cevimeline, a medication used to treat symptoms of dry mouth in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, does not list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction identified during clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions section details numerous potential side effects seen at various incidences, some related to the digestive system, but GI bleeding such as a gastric ulcer, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or rectum hemorrhage appears infrequently (less than 3%), and no explicit mention of ""GI bleed"" as a terminology is made in the common reactions.

While it is important to note that the ""Digestive Disorders"" category in the adverse reactions section does include several conditions related to the digestive tract, such as gastric ulcer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, these are not presented as common adverse reactions to the drug, as they were reported at incidences of less than 3%. Additionally, it appears that establishing a direct causal relationship between cevimeline and GI bleed is not definitively provided in the label information. 

Furthermore, post-marketing adverse events are reported voluntarily and, due to the nature of this surveillance, it can be challenging to accurately determine their frequency or a clear causal relationship to drug exposure. The label does not provide data from post-marketing surveillance that would suggest a widely recognized concern regarding GI bleed associated with cevimeline use.

In summary, based on the information provided from the drug label for cevimeline, there is no strong evidence or frequent reporting linking cevimeline to GI bleed as an adverse reaction. However, rare digestive disorders associated with bleeding have been reported in less than 3% of the cases in clinical trial data. As always, it is crucial for healthcare providers to closely monitor patients for any adverse reactions and report them appropriately to further evaluate potential drug-related risks.
",NA
gi bleed,chlorzoxazone,,"Based on the provided relevant sections from the drug label, there is mention that gastrointestinal bleeding can occur, but it appears to be a rare instance when associated with chlorzoxazone. Here is a summary of the evidence mentioned:

1. Case reports or post-marketing surveillance: The label implies that there have been rare instances where gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is reported in patients taking chlorzoxazone. This suggests that evidence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction may come from post-marketing surveillance, which typically includes voluntary reports from healthcare providers or patients after the drug has been released into the market. However, specific case studies or the frequency of these reports is not mentioned.

2. Clinical trials: The drug label does not include any explicit reference to GI bleeding occurring in the context of clinical trials. Therefore, it can be inferred that the known association may not have been observed or reported in the pre-marketing clinical trials, or if it occurred, it was considered rare.

3. Box warnings and Warnings sections: The drug label does not have a box warning for chlorzoxazone, which indicates that, while gastrointestinal bleeding is noted as a potential rare adverse reaction, it is not a risk that has been deemed severe enough to warrant the highest level of warning by the FDA.

In conclusion, the evidence suggesting a relationship between GI bleed and chlorzoxazone is based on rare reports that have likely emerged from post-marketing surveillance. There is no specified evidence from controlled clinical trials detailing this relationship, and the box warnings and warnings sections do not emphasize GI bleed as a major concern. As always, the reported potential for an adverse event does not establish causality, and healthcare providers should consider this information in the context of the patient's overall clinical picture when prescribing chlorzoxazone. Further research such as observational studies or case-control studies could provide more detailed evidence regarding the incidence and risk factors associated with GI bleeding in patients taking chlorzoxazone.",NA
gi bleed,cidofovir,,"Based on the information provided from the clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance contained within the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) is listed under the ""Digestive System"" subsection as an observed adverse event. While this listing does not specify the frequency of the event or establish a causal relationship with cidofovir, its inclusion indicates that GI bleed has been reported in patients receiving the drug.

The sections provided do not offer detailed evidence linking cidofovir exposure to GI bleed through clinical trials, such as specific incidence rates in a controlled population versus a placebo or comparative group, nor do they provide information on the circumstances or the number of reports received through post-marketing surveillance. Therefore, while gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been observed in clinical studies involving cidofovir, we cannot conclusively determine from the provided sections alone whether cidofovir causes GI bleed, at what frequency it may occur, or under what specific conditions the risk may be heightened.

If further information or data sources are available, they would be necessary to better evaluate the evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction and cidofovir exposure. In the absence of this information, health care providers should exercise clinical judgment and consider the known safety profile of cidofovir, including its major renal toxicity, when assessing the risk of GI bleed or when faced with patients presenting with such symptoms. Monitoring and reporting any adverse reactions related to cidofovir are crucial for the ongoing assessment of the drug's safety.",NA
gi bleed,cilostazol,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and cilostazol use is derived from postmarketing experience, as summarized below:

**Postmarketing Experience**:
- Adverse reactions identified from post-approval use, which are reported voluntarily and not from controlled trials, include gastrointestinal hemorrhage among other reactions. However, due to the voluntary nature and unknown size of the reporting population, it is difficult to estimate the frequency of these adverse reactions or to establish a causal relationship to cilostazol exposure with certainty.

**Clinical Trials Experience**:
- The clinical trials section of the drug label does not specifically list GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction. Instead, it provides a list of the most common adverse reactions that were more frequent in cilostazol-treated patients compared to placebo. Less frequent clinical significant adverse reactions (less than 2%) included melena, which is a dark sticky feces containing partly digested blood indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Warnings and Precautions**:
- While the Warnings and Precautions section of the label mentions several hematologic adverse reactions and advises caution, it does not explicitly state GI bleeding as a known risk associated with cilostazol. However, the section advises against using cilostazol in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding, implying that there is at least a theoretical or observed risk of bleeding complications.

**Boxed Warnings**:
- The boxed warnings for cilostazol focus on the risk of heart failure and do not address GI bleeding.

In summary, while there is no direct evidence from clinical trials linking cilostazol to GI bleeding as a common reaction, there is recognition of a potential bleeding risk, including GI hemorrhage, in the postmarketing surveillance data. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse reaction, especially in patients with risk factors for bleeding, and report such incidents to further contribute to the data on cilostazol's safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,cinacalcet,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label of cinacalcet, there is evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of cinacalcet, particularly upper gastrointestinal bleeding, derived from postmarketing experience and clinical trial data.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
Within the clinical trials, there is no explicit mention of GI bleeding as a commonly reported adverse reaction in the presented tables (Tables 1, 2, and 3), which list adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea among others. However, the sections do not exclude the possibility of less common adverse reactions not captured by these tables.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
In the postmarketing experience, gastrointestinal bleeding is documented as an adverse reaction identified after approval use of cinacalcet. The size of the affected population and the causality are not definitively established due to the nature of voluntary reporting but suggest an association between cinacalcet and gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Warnings and Precautions (5.2 Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding):**
This section highlights cases of GI bleeding, emphasizing upper GI bleeding in patients using calcimimetics, including cinacalcet. While the exact cause of GI bleeding in these patients is unspecified, the label advises that those with risk factors for upper GI bleeding may be at increased risk when receiving cinacalcet. Patients are to be monitored for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding and managed appropriately.

**Cause of Death in Clinical Trial:**
There is a specific mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a cause of death in a patient during cinacalcet treatment in a study involving patients with parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. This reference further supports the potential association between cinacalcet and GI bleeding risk.

It should be noted that while this summary references the reported adverse reaction of GI bleed related to cinacalcet, the evidence is primarily from postmarketing data, which generally lacks the rigor of controlled clinical trials. The drug label indicates that GI bleeding risk may be increased in patients receiving cinacalcet and suggests monitoring and prompt evaluation for this event.

",NA
gi bleed,ciprofloxacin,,"The summary of evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and ciprofloxacin exposure is derived from Section 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience) and Section 6.2 (Postmarketing Experience) of the provided drug label.

In the clinical trial data provided (Section 6.1), gastrointestinal bleeding is listed among the medically important adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of ciprofloxacin patients. This indicates that during clinical studies involving ciprofloxacin, some instances of GI bleeding were observed as an adverse reaction to the drug. However, the exact number or the context of these occurrences, such as the severity of the bleeding or any associated risk factors, is not detailed in the provided excerpts.

From the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2), GI bleed is not explicitly mentioned, which suggests that if there were reports of GI bleeding as an adverse reaction, they may not have been common or consistently attributed to ciprofloxacin use during postmarketing surveillance.

Therefore, while GI bleed is noted as an adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin within clinical trials, the evidence is based on a frequency of less than 1%, indicating it is an infrequent event. The limited information does not allow a detailed assessment of causality or risk factors. As with all medications, healthcare providers must evaluate the benefits of ciprofloxacin use against the potential risks of adverse reactions, including GI bleed, particularly for patients who may have other risk factors for this condition.

It is essential to consider this information in the broader context of the drug's safety profile and in conjunction with a healthcare provider's clinical judgment and patient-specific factors. If healthcare providers or patients suspect an adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin, including GI bleed, they should report it to the appropriate surveillance systems, such as the FDA MedWatch program.",NA
gi bleed,citalopram,1.0,"Evidence suggesting a relationship between the use of citalopram and the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, including gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, comes from multiple sources as detailed below:

1. Clinical Trial Experience:
The safety data provided for citalopram includes exposure in patients and/or healthy subjects from various studies. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment show gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea (4% for citalopram vs. 0% for placebo) and vomiting (1% for citalopram), although GI bleeding is not specifically mentioned in these sections.

2. Warnings and Precautions:
In the provided sections, an increased risk of bleeding is noted under Warnings and Precautions (5.4). While this warning does not mention GI bleed specifically, bleeding risks typically include both the potential for internal hemorrhages such as GI bleed and more superficial bleeding events.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
Postmarketing reports, which can include data gathered after a drug has been released to the market, indicate gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an identified adverse reaction, as found in section 6.2 of the provided text. Postmarketing data is valuable because it often includes a broader patient population and longer-term usage patterns than clinical trials.

4. Mechanism-Based Plausibility:
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram are known to affect platelet aggregation due to their action on serotonin uptake. Since platelets depend on serotonin to promote hemostasis, SSRIs can theoretically lead to an increased bleeding risk, including GI bleed.

5. Clinical Guidelines and Literature:
Although not included in the provided sections, it is worth noting that clinical guidelines and literature reviews often mention the association between SSRI use and increased risk of GI bleeding as a known pharmacological effect, reinforcing the evidence provided in the postmarketing surveillance.

In summary, while the initial clinical trial data for citalopram does not specifically list GI bleed as an adverse reaction, other sections of the label, along with postmarketing experience and the pharmacologic properties of SSRIs, support an increased risk of bleeding including GI hemorrhage as a potential adverse reaction to citalopram. Healthcare providers should be aware of this risk and monitor patients accordingly, especially those with other risk factors for bleeding or those on concurrent therapy that may further increase the risk of hemorrhage (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants).",NA
gi bleed,clofarabine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and clofarabine exposure can be found in the provided sections of the drug label both from the clinical trial experience as well as post-marketing surveillance.

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**
In clinical trial data with pediatric patients treated with clofarabine, no specific mention of GI bleed as a distinct adverse event is found. However, there is mention of gastrointestinal disorders such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, stomatitis, vomiting, and more relevant to GI bleed, gingival or mouth bleeding. While these are not direct reports of GI bleed, they suggest that the drug has the potential to affect the GI system in a way that could lead to adverse outcomes such as bleeding.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
More direct evidence comes from the post-marketing experience, where gastrointestinal hemorrhage including fatalities is reported as an adverse reaction. Because these events are voluntarily reported after the drug has been approved and thus the size of the population is uncertain, establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is challenging. However, the inclusion of GI hemorrhage in this section indicates that evidence has accrued post-approval suggesting a possible connection to clofarabine exposure.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
Furthermore, the warnings and precautions section (5.2) of the label specifically addresses the risk of serious and fatal hemorrhage, including GI hemorrhage. It suggests that bleeding events could be associated with thrombocytopenia, a known side effect of clofarabine. Although thrombocytopenia is not a direct indicator of GI bleed, it significantly increases the risk of bleeding, indicating an indirect relationship between clofarabine-induced thrombocytopenia and the potential for a GI bleed.

**Summary:**
In conclusion, while the initial clinical trials data with clofarabine do not explicitly report GI bleed, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance that indicates gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including those that are fatal, as an adverse reaction potentially related to the drug. Additionally, the drug's known side effects, including thrombocytopenia, and warnings about the increased risk of hemorrhage support the plausibility of a GI bleed as an adverse reaction to clofarabine exposure.",NA
gi bleed,clopidogrel,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and clopidogrel exposure is well-documented in clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

Clinical Trials Evidence:

1. **CURE Trial**: The label presents data from the CURE trial, where the use of clopidogrel with aspirin showed an increase in major bleeding, primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites, compared to placebo with aspirin. Table 1 from the CURE trial details the incidence of bleeding complications, with major bleeding at 3.7% in the clopidogrel group versus 2.7% in the placebo group.

2. **COMMIT Trial**: Similar rates of major bleeding were observed in both the clopidogrel and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin. Table 2 indicates no significant difference in major bleeding rates between the two groups, which may be attributed to the concomitant aspirin use.

3. **CAPRIE Trial**: The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel versus aspirin and showed gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking clopidogrel compared to 2.7% for those taking aspirin. Though the GI bleeding rate was slightly lower in the clopidogrel group, it's important to note that the trial still established bleeding as a risk for clopidogrel patients.

Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:

During post-approval use of clopidogrel, hemorrhages, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported. The spontaneity of these reports and the unknown size of the population make it difficult to estimate the frequency accurately. However, they do support the relationship between clopidogrel use and the risk of bleeding events, including GI bleed.

Warnings and Precautions:

The drug label emphasizes the general risk of bleeding associated with thienopyridines like clopidogrel, especially due to their antiplatelet activity which can persist for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days). Also, factors such as concomitant use with other drugs that increase bleeding risk are highlighted.

In conclusion, the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicates that GI bleed is a recognized adverse reaction associated with clopidogrel exposure. This information is corroborated by the specific data provided in the CURE, COMMIT, and CAPRIE trials, as well as the documented cases from real-world use after the drug's approval.",NA
gi bleed,cobimetinib,,"**Summary of Evidence for GI Bleed and Cobimetinib Exposure:**

Cobimetinib, marketed under the brand name Cotellic, is indicated for use in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Evidence suggesting a relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and cobimetinib exposure arises from its clinical trial data as well as the drug's safety profile as described in the label sections for adverse reactions and warnings.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In the ""Adverse Reactions"" section of the cobimetinib drug label, hemorrhage is listed as a potential adverse event. The evidence comes from Trial 1, a randomized study that evaluated the safety of cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Results from this trial showed that hemorrhage of all grades occurred in 13% of patients receiving cobimetinib with vemurafenib, compared to 7% in patients receiving vemurafenib alone. Grade 3-4 hemorrhages occurred in 1.2% of patients on the cobimetinib combination. Specific instances of gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reported at a rate of 3.6% in the cobimetinib group versus 1.2% in the control group.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The label instructs to report suspected adverse reactions to the FDA, indicating ongoing monitoring is in place for side effects such as GI bleed through post-marketing surveillance. Any new data related to adverse effects, including GI bleeding, may come from healthcare providers, patients, or manufacturers after the drug has been released on the market.

**Warnings:**
In the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section, hemorrhage, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, is acknowledged as a possible risk associated with cobimetinib. In the backdrop of these warnings, healthcare professionals are instructed to monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Although gastrointestinal bleeding is not called out as a boxed warning, its presence under ""Warnings and Precautions"" heightens the vigilance required in the event of such an adverse effect.

**Conclusion:**
The evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed and cobimetinib exposure includes clinical data from randomized trials and the established safety profile of the drug, which includes monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding. The higher incidence of all-grade hemorrhages and specifically gastrointestinal hemorrhages in patients treated with cobimetinib, as compared to controls, indicates an increased risk associated with the drug. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor patients for bleeding and manage accordingly, which may include interventions such as withholding or discontinuing the drug.",NA
gi bleed,cyclophosphamide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for cyclophosphamide, gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is listed under the postmarketing experience as an identified adverse reaction, although a precise frequency cannot be established as the reports come from a population of unknown size. Hemorrhagic colitis, which can potentially lead to a GI bleed, is also mentioned as an isolated reported event during cyclophosphamide therapy in the section describing common adverse reactions.

Specific sources, such as detailed case studies or clinical trials directly associating cyclophosphamide with GI bleeding, are not provided in the given information. Thus, while there is some evidence from postmarketing surveillance suggesting a possible association between cyclophosphamide exposure and GI bleeding events, the exact incidence and risk factors are not clearly delineated. Clinicians are typically alerted to such potential adverse reactions through these labeling sections, and additional vigilance is warranted in practice to monitor for such events.

Should more detailed investigation be needed to fully understand the relationship between cyclophosphamide and GI bleeding, it would likely involve a more thorough review of the literature, including case reports, clinical trial data, and epidemiological studies. However, within the limits of the current context and based on the provided information, it appears that there is some evidence to suggest that GI bleeding is a potential adverse reaction following cyclophosphamide therapy.",NA
gi bleed,dabigatran etexilate,,"The provided drug label information for dabigatran etexilate (marketed as PRADAXA) clearly indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a known adverse reaction associated with the use of this medication.

Clinical Trial Evidence:
The Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) study is a pivotal trial that provided safety data on two doses of dabigatran compared to warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Among the findings, there is evidence of a higher rate of major GI bleeding events in patients receiving 150 mg of dabigatran twice daily compared to warfarin (dabigatran 1.59% per year vs. warfarin 1.05% per year, hazard ratio 1.51, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.92). Additionally, any gastrointestinal bleeding occurred more frequently with dabigatran (6.6%) versus warfarin (4.2%).

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
The drug label also mentions that postmarketing experience has identified GI bleeding as an adverse event linked to dabigatran use. While these reports are voluntary and do not provide a rate or clear causal relationship due to the uncertain size of the population, they are consistent with the observations from the clinical trials.

Warnings:
The drug label contains a specific warning about the risk of bleeding associated with dabigatran use, underscoring the importance of evaluating any signs or symptoms of blood loss and considering the discontinuation of dabigatran in patients with active pathological bleeding.

Box Warnings:
Although the box warnings do not directly address GI bleeding, they emphasize the risks associated with premature discontinuation of dabigatran and the potential for serious bleeding events such as spinal/epidural hematomas.

In summary, the relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and dabigatran etexilate exposure is well-supported by evidence from the RE-LY clinical trial and further corroborated by post-marketing reports. These findings are explicitly stated in the drug's label, which includes relevant warnings about the risk of bleeding in general.",NA
gi bleed,dabigatran etexilate,,"The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and dabigatran etexilate exposure is supported by numerous sources, as evidenced by the extensive data provided. Here is a concise summary of that evidence:

**Clinical Trial Evidence:**

1. **RE-LY Study (Adult Trials - Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation):** This study provides safety information on the use of dabigatran etexilate. It was observed that the most serious adverse reactions with dabigatran etexilate were related to bleeding, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily demonstrated a higher rate of any GI bleeds compared to warfarin (6.6% vs. 4.2%, respectively). Major bleeding events specific to the GI tract were also more frequent in the dabigatran group than in the warfarin group (1.59% vs. 1.05% annual event rate, respectively).

2. **RE-COVER and RE-COVER II (Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism):** In these trials, GI bleeding was reported as an adverse event in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate (0.6% vs. 0.5% for warfarin).

3. **RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE (Extended Treatment):** These studies comparing dabigatran etexilate with warfarin and placebo, respectively, reported any GI bleeds in dabigatran etexilate-treated patients (3.1% vs. 2.2% on warfarin in RE-MEDY and 0.7% vs. 0.3% on placebo in RE-SONATE).

4. **RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II (Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery):** Major GI bleeding events occurred at a similar rate in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate when compared to those receiving enoxaparin (0.1% for both).

**Warnings and Precautions Labeling:**

This section reinforces the increased risk of bleeding, particularly GI bleeding, with dabigatran etexilate as a serious and potentially fatal adverse reaction, with recommendations to evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss and discontinue the drug in patients with active pathological bleeding.

**Postmarketing Experience:**

Postmarketing surveillance has also identified gastrointestinal disorders like esophageal ulcer, further adding to the body of evidence that dabigatran etexilate is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Conclusion:**

There is substantial evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance supporting the association between gastrointestinal bleeding and dabigatran etexilate use. This evidence is derived from various study settings, including comparisons with warfarin and placebo, and in different populations such as patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, those undergoing treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and patients following hip replacement surgery. The drug’s label includes a warning of increased risk of bleeding and advises caution and regular monitoring.",NA
gi bleed,dabrafenib,,"Evidence supports the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. The prescribing information for dabrafenib, which is summarized below, indicates GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction.

Clinical Trials Experience:
- The adverse reactions section (6.1) of the prescribing information lists hemorrhage, including GI hemorrhage, as an adverse event observed across a pooled safety population for TAFINLAR (dabrafenib) administered with trametinib.
- GI hemorrhage occurred in 3% of adult patients receiving the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib.
- Serious hemorrhagic events have been reported, including major hemorrhages in critical areas or organs, which could be life-threatening or fatal. Fatal hemorrhages included cerebral and brainstem hemorrhages.
- In the pediatric safety population, hemorrhagic events, including GI hemorrhage, occurred in 25% of patients.

Postmarketing Experience:
- The postmarketing experience section (6.2) indicates that major hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients taking dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Fatal cases have been reported.

Warning and Precautions:
- The warnings and precautions section (5.3) explicitly warns about the risk of hemorrhage, including major hemorrhagic events, when dabrafenib is administered with trametinib. Recommendations include monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding and permanent discontinuation or withholding of dabrafenib for Grade 4 hemorrhagic events or for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve.

Thus, there is clear evidence from the clinical safety data and postmarketing surveillance indicating that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction associated with dabrafenib, especially when used in combination with trametinib. Clinicians are advised to monitor for signs of bleeding and to exercise caution, particularly in patients with risk factors for hemorrhage or when using dabrafenib in conjunction with trametinib.

The sources of the evidence are the TAFINLAR (dabrafenib) prescribing information, which includes data from clinical trials, and reported postmarketing experiences.",NA
gi bleed,dabrafenib,,"Based on the provided drug label information, hemorrhage is an identified adverse reaction when dabrafenib is administered with trametinib, which is confirmed in the ""Warnings and Precautions (5.3)"" section of the drug label. Specifically, major hemorrhagic events, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, can occur with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. In the pooled safety population described in the ""Adverse Reactions (6.1)"" section, hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of adult patients treated with the combination, with gastrointestinal hemorrhage reported in 3% of these patients. Additionally, in the pediatric safety pool, hemorrhagic events occurred in 25% of patients. However, it should be noted that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) does not seem to be the most common type of bleeding event reported.

The drug label also mentions fatal hemorrhages have occurred, with cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage being specifically highlighted as fatal events, but no explicit mention is made of gastrointestinal bleeding as a cause of fatality. It should be acknowledged that the hemorrhagic events could potentially include GI bleeds among other types of bleeding, as gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as one of the hemorrhagic events.

Furthermore, patients are advised to be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding, and dabrafenib (in combination with trametinib) should be permanently discontinued for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve.

In summary, while gastrointestinal hemorrhage is reported as an adverse reaction in patients receiving dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, detailed evidence such as specific incidence rates from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance for GI bleed specifically as an adverse reaction to dabrafenib alone is not provided in the provided sections of the drug label. The relationship is recognized in the context of combined therapy with trametinib, and appropriate monitoring and discontinuation recommendations are provided for managing hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,dalbavancin,,"In the clinical trials and post-marketing experience detailed in the drug label sections provided, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (which includes gastrointestinal bleed or GI bleed) is mentioned as an adverse reaction occurring in less than 2% of patients treated with dalbavancin in clinical trials. However, no specific incidence rate or detailed data on the occurrence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to dalbavancin are provided. It is also not listed among the most common adverse reactions, which suggests it is a less frequent event.

To summarize, there is mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an adverse reaction to dalbavancin in clinical trials, although the evidence appears to be limited due to its occurrence in less than 2% of the treated patients. No specific data or further details on this adverse event are provided within the label sections shared, and there is no mention of GI bleed in the post-marketing surveillance section. Thus, while there is some evidence of GI bleed being a potential adverse reaction to dalbavancin, the information available in the provided label sections suggests that it is a rare event. Further investigation into additional sources such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, or a broader set of post-marketing data might provide more insight into the frequency and causality of this adverse reaction with dalbavancin exposure.",NA
gi bleed,dalbavancin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for dalbavancin, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, is listed as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, although at a rate of less than 2%. This evidence suggests that there is a potential relationship between dalbavancin exposure and the occurrence of GI bleed. Since the exact frequency is not specified, it may be considered a rare adverse event. 

Further details outlined in the label regarding adverse reactions include common adverse reactions occurring in more than 4% of adult patients, which were nausea, headache, and diarrhea. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 4.9% of patients treated with dalbavancin across multiple dosing regimens, and 2.6% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.

Regarding post-marketing experience, the documentation does not mention GI bleed explicitly as a post-marketing reported adverse reaction. Thus, the primary source of evidence for GI bleed as an adverse reaction comes from the Phase 2/3 clinical trials data, where GI bleed is included under gastrointestinal disorders with a frequency of less than 2%.

In summary, GI bleed is an identified adverse reaction of dalbavancin, as indicated by clinical trial data, although it appears to be an infrequent event. It is important to note that post-marketing data provided did not report GI bleed specifically, but the absence in this data does not rule out its potential occurrence as a rare adverse event. Healthcare providers should be aware of this possible risk when prescribing dalbavancin and monitor patients accordingly. Clinical judgements should balance the benefits of dalbavancin therapy against its potential risks for adverse reactions, including GI bleed.","Based on the provided drug label information, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, and hematochezia are listed under gastrointestinal disorders as adverse reactions occurring in less than 2% of patients in the clinical trials for DALVANCE. There is no explicit mention of a gi bleed as an adverse reaction specifically associated with DALVANCE in the drug label. Nonetheless, gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be considered a form of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could suggest a potential association, although its occurrence in the context of DALVANCE administration appears to be rare based on the clinical trials data provided.

However, the absence of a specific mention of gi bleed in the most common adverse reactions or in the boxed warnings, as well as the lack of detailed data regarding the frequency and context of gastrointestinal hemorrhage reports, limits the scope of evidence available to conclusively refute the relationship between gi bleed and DALVANCE exposure.

Therefore, while there is no strong evidence presented in the provided label sections to suggest that gi bleed is a common or characteristic adverse reaction of DALVANCE, a low occurrence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported in clinical trials associated with the drug. Further post-marketing surveillance and studies could provide additional clarity on this relationship. As always, health care providers should monitor patients for any signs of adverse reactions and report them accordingly."
gi bleed,dalteparin,,"Evidence supports the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of dalteparin (FRAGMIN), a low molecular weight heparin, by drawing on clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance.

In the clinical trials section of the drug label, several studies are cited where bleeding events were recorded in patients treated with dalteparin. Notably, in the context of hip replacement surgery, GI bleeding was explicitly mentioned in one patient. Additionally, in the study involving medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness, there were fatal GI hemorrhages in two patients receiving dalteparin by Day 21.

Post-marketing experience further substantiates the risk, with GI bleeding being one of the causes of death reported for patients on dalteparin. While specific numbers are not provided for post-marketing surveillance, the fact that the drug label includes this data suggests GI bleeding is recognized as a potential adverse event. 

The risk of any bleeding events, which would include GI bleed, is highlighted in sections discussing risks of hemorrhage (5.1), considerations for spinal/epidural hematomas (warnings and boxed warnings), the need to consider the risk of bleeding with concomitant use of medications that affect hemostasis (such as NSAIDs and other anticoagulants).

With this evidence, it is clear that there is a recognized relationship between GI bleeding and dalteparin usage, albeit not every patient will experience this adverse reaction, and the risk can be increased by various patient-specific and treatment-related factors. The drug label acts as a primary source encapsulating findings from numerous studies and post-marketing reports.",NA
gi bleed,dantrolene,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is noted as a less frequent adverse reaction associated with the use of dantrolene sodium. This information can be found listed under the subsection for gastrointestinal side effects in the ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section of the label. It is important to recognize that this labeling indicates a recognized association between dantrolene use and GI bleeding, even though it may not be a common occurrence.

Evidence for the association between GI bleeding and dantrolene may have originated from clinical observation, post-marketing surveillance, or case reports which are often pooled together to inform drug labels. However, the specific sources (such as clinical trial data, individual case studies, or numbers of reports from post-marketing surveillance) that led to the inclusion of GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction are not provided in the excerpt.

In this case, there is no explicit mention of clinical trials that specifically aimed to investigate GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to dantrolene, nor are there any details on the frequency or the circumstances under which this reaction tends to occur (such as dosage levels, duration of treatment, or patient characteristics). Without this level of detail, it is difficult to make a precise assessment of the risk. 

Clinicians prescribing dantrolene are advised to be aware of this potential adverse reaction and to monitor for signs of GI bleeding, especially since dantrolene also carries a warning for hepatotoxicity, which can be a contributing factor for gastrointestinal complications.

For a more detailed understanding or specific case information that led to such a labeling decision, one may need to consult the published literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting systems, or the manufacturing pharmaceutical company's pharmacovigilance data. Additionally, further research using medical databases like PubMed could yield more information regarding the relationship between dantrolene and GI bleed if available.",NA
gi bleed,dasatinib,,"The provided drug label sections include warnings, adverse reactions, and postmarketing experience associated with the use of dasatinib (brand name SPRYCEL), a medication used to treat various phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The evidence supporting the association between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction and dasatinib is as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - In the section ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience,"" GI bleed is explicitly mentioned under ""Hemorrhage,"" where it states that gastrointestinal bleeding is an identified adverse reaction, affecting 2% of patients in clinical trials of adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML.
   - More specifically, Grade 3 or 4 (severe) hemorrhage occurred in 5.8% of adult patients, with the most frequent site of hemorrhage being gastrointestinal.
   - In terms of pediatric patients, the adverse reaction tables (Table 11 and Table 14) do not list GI bleed as a common adverse reaction (≥10% incidence), suggesting that this particular adverse event may not be as prevalent in the pediatric population or within the specific studies referenced.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - In the section ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience,"" although various additional adverse reactions are reported, gastrointestinal bleeding is not explicitly mentioned, suggesting that it may not be a commonly reported adverse event in the postmarketing setting.

3. Warnings and Precautions:
   - In the ""5.2 Bleeding-Related Events"" subsection, it is stated that dasatinib can cause serious and fatal bleeding, with Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding being explicitly mentioned. This indicates that there is a recognized risk of serious GI bleed associated with the drug, which may require treatment interventions such as interruptions and transfusions.

4. Hematology and Laboratory Abnormalities:
   - While the provided ""Laboratory Abnormalities"" sections focus on myelosuppression and related blood cell counts, they do not directly address GI bleed. However, the relationship between myelosuppression (particularly thrombocytopenia) and increased bleeding risk, including GI bleed, is established in medical practice.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials has documented gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse reaction of dasatinib, particularly in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. This is further supported by a specific warning of bleeding-related events in the drug label, including gastrointestinal bleeding. While the available postmarketing experience does not highlight GI bleed as a common postmarketing adverse event, the drug label advises caution due to the potential severity of bleeding risks associated with dasatinib.",NA
gi bleed,decitabine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for decitabine, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is not explicitly listed as one of the most common adverse reactions (>50%). The most common adverse reactions include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pyrexia. However, adverse reactions related to the gastrointestinal system, such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and stomatitis, were reported.

In the presented clinical trials, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was documented as a serious adverse reaction that occurred in some patients taking decitabine, but the label does not give a specific incidence rate for this adverse event. Additionally, oral mucosal petechiae and gingival bleeding were listed as adverse reactions, which suggests that hemorrhagic events in the mucosal tissues may occur with decitabine use. While the clinical trial details do not explicitly mention ""GI bleed"" as a common terminology, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage could be indicative of a serious GI bleeding event. 

The postmarketing experience mentioned in the drug label does not specifically list GI bleed as an adverse reaction identified during post-approval use.

It is important to note that in clinical practice, drugs that cause myelosuppression, like decitabine, can indirectly increase the risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Decitabine treatment leads to significant thrombocytopenia, which is a known risk factor for bleeding, including potentially GI bleeding. However, based on the information provided, there is no direct or explicit evidence linking decitabine to GI bleeding as a frequent adverse event.

In summary, there is mention of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a serious adverse reaction in patients receiving decitabine, but no explicit evidence within the provided label sections indicates that GI bleed is a commonly observed adverse reaction. Indirect association is plausible through drug-induced thrombocytopenia, which could predispose to bleeding complications, including potentially in the gastrointestinal tract.",NA
gi bleed,deferasirox,,"The clinical evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, specifically gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), and exposure to deferasirox comes from various sources, as outlined in the drug labeling provided:

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
Deferasirox has been associated with GI hemorrhage as reported in the clinical trials for different patient populations, including those with transfusional iron overload, sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia syndromes (NTDT). GI hemorrhage is identified in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.3) of the drug labeling.

**Adverse Reactions:**
GI hemorrhage is specifically listed under adverse reactions in the labeling, highlighting its significance and appearance in more than 5% of the deferasirox-treated patient population in the pooled analysis for the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) studies. The label mentions that GI hemorrhage, including deaths, has been reported, especially in elderly patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and/or low platelet counts.

**Postmarketing Experience:**
The labeling also acknowledges postmarketing reports of adverse reactions, including GI hemorrhage. The postmarketing period reflects the experiences with the drug once it has been approved and is an essential aspect of understanding a drug's adverse event profile.

**Boxed Warnings:**
The association of deferasirox with GI hemorrhage is significant enough to warrant inclusion in the boxed warning, which highlights the most severe potential adverse effects of a medication. The warning advises that deferasirox may cause GI hemorrhage, which may be fatal, particularly in elderly patients with advanced hematologic disorders and low platelet counts.

**Summary:**
The evidence of an association between deferasirox and GI hemorrhage is based on clinical trial data, adverse reaction reports, and postmarketing surveillance. Close patient monitoring, particularly of renal and hepatic function, is recommended when using deferasirox, with the boxed warning underscoring the potential seriousness of GI hemorrhage. The provided sections indicate that health professionals should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and hemorrhage during therapy, and the drug should be discontinued if a serious GI adverse reaction is suspected.

Sources:
- Adverse Reactions section (6.1) of the labeling mentions gastrointestinal symptoms as adverse reactions.
- Warnings and Precautions section (5.3) of the labeling details the risk of GI hemorrhage.
- The boxed warning strongly emphasizes the risk of renal failure, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.","NA

Deferasirox, as indicated in the provided drug label sections, includes gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage as a clinically significant adverse reaction and warning. It is also specifically mentioned within the boxed warning for the potential to cause GI hemorrhage. Since the evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed and deferasirox exposure is clearly acknowledged in the drug label, which is a regulatory document developed through a stringent review of clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance, refuting the relationship would not align with the given authoritative information.

In summary, the relationship between GI bleed and deferasirox is established in the prescribing information, and no evidence refuting this association has been provided within the context given."
gi bleed,defibrotide,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as an adverse reaction and exposure to defibrotide is provided in the drug's labeling, particularly in the sections detailing clinical trial experiences and warnings.

**Clinical Trials Experience:**
The safety of DEFITELIO was assessed in clinical trials involving 176 adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) with pulmonary and/or renal dysfunction following hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). These trials excluded patients who had significant acute bleeding at the time of study entry. Adverse reaction recording during these trials did not mandate reporting events related to hepatic VOD or those expected after HSCT, except if they were serious or Grade 4-5.

In these trials, hemorrhage events of any type and any grade were reported in 104 (59%) of the patients, and the events were grade 4-5 in 35 (20%). GI hemorrhage specifically was one of the adverse reactions listed, occurring in 15 (9%) patients, with 5 (3%) of those being grade 4-5 events. This indicates that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction associated with DEFITELIO.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
Section 5.1 of the provided labeling explicitly states that DEFITELIO can increase the risk of bleeding in patients following HSCT due to the drug's effect on increasing the activity of fibrinolytic enzymes in vitro. It advises against initiating DEFITELIO in patients with active bleeding and recommends monitoring for signs of bleeding. It also notes that if patients on DEFITELIO develop bleeding, the drug should be discontinued.

The labeling underscores the heightened risk of bleeding associated with DEFITELIO and provides clarity on the management of bleeding events should they occur.

In summary, clinical trial evidence demonstrates that GI hemorrhage is an adverse reaction in patients treated with DEFITELIO, occurring in 9% of the patients with a smaller percentage experiencing severe events. These findings are corroborated by specific warnings detailed on the drug label itself. Given that GI bleed is mentioned in both clinical trial data and the warnings section, there is a clear indication that this adverse reaction is associated with defibrotide use.","NA

Given the evidence from clinical trials and the warnings provided in the drug label, it is clear that bleeding, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, is a recognized adverse reaction to defibrotide. Therefore, refuting the relationship between GI bleed and defibrotide exposure is not supported by the available evidence."
gi bleed,desvenlafaxine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections and available literature, there is evidence supporting an increased risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, as an adverse reaction to desvenlafaxine use. The evidence for this association includes the following:

1. **Clinical Trials:**
   - Section 5.4 ""Increased Risk of Bleeding"" in the drug label warns of the increased bleeding risk associated with the use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake, which includes desvenlafaxine. This section notes that the risk is elevated with concurrent use of antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs, or anticoagulants.
   - Additionally, under section 6.1 ""Clinical Studies Experience,"" the label describes the common adverse reactions from desvenlafaxine clinical trials. While GI bleeding is not explicitly listed, the increased incidence of nausea and vomiting could be indicative of upper GI irritation, a potential precursor to GI bleeding.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
   - In section 6.2 ""Postmarketing Experience,"" there is an acknowledgment of adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of desvenlafaxine. Although specific to GI bleed is not mentioned, the surveillance data often includes a broader range of bleeding events that could potentially include GI bleeding.
   - Epidemiological data derived from post-marketing surveillance across the class of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), to which desvenlafaxine belongs, have historically suggested a relationship between SNRI use and bleeding risks.

3. **Biological Plausibility:**
   - The pharmacological action of desvenlafaxine that increases the risk of bleeding is likely related to its effect on the reuptake of serotonin. Serotonin plays a role in platelet aggregation; hence, its reuptake inhibition by medications like desvenlafaxine could impair platelet function and increase bleeding risk.

4. **Literature:**
   - While specific case studies or additional clinical trials focused on desvenlafaxine-induced GI bleeding are not cited in the provided label information, the class effect of SNRIs, and the general mechanism of increased bleeding risk associated with serotonin modulation, provide indirect support.
   
In summary, while the drug label does not explicitly mention GI bleed as a documented adverse reaction in the clinical trials for desvenlafaxine, the warning related to an ""Increased Risk of Bleeding"" supports a potential association. This is further supported by pharmacodynamic considerations and post-marketing reports of bleeding events within this drug class. As always, healthcare professionals should weigh the benefits and risks of desvenlafaxine in patients, especially those with known risk factors for bleeding or those concurrently using medications that may exacerbate this risk.",NA
gi bleed,desvenlafaxine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleeding and the use of desvenlalfaxine (marketed as PRISTIQ), which is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD). 

Evidence from Warnings and Precautions Sections:
- The drug label warns of ""Abnormal Bleeding"" under subsections 5.4 of Warnings and Precautions, indicating an increased risk of bleeding events with PRISTIQ use.
- It is stated that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and SNRIs, such as PRISTIQ, may increase the risk of bleeding.
- An association is noted between the use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This suggests that GI bleeding, as an adverse reaction, is recognized based on case reports, epidemiological studies, or clinical experience with similar drugs, even though it may not be reported at a high frequency in clinical trials.
- The label advises caution with the concurrent use of PRISTIQ and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation, which could increase the risk of bleeding.

Evidence from Adverse Reactions Sections:
- While gastrointestinal bleeding is not explicitly mentioned in the section detailing common adverse reactions observed in placebo-controlled MDD studies (6.1), subsection 6.2 notes the identification of abnormal bleeding as an adverse reaction during post-approval use of PRISTIQ.
- Subsection 6.3 mentions GI bleeding as an adverse reaction reported with other SNRIs, implying a class effect that may also apply to desvenlafaxine.

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- In the clinical trials referenced, GI bleeding is not listed among the most commonly observed adverse reactions for the given dosages in the short-term studies. However, since clinical trials are typically not powered to detect rare adverse events, and given that post-marketing surveillance often captures rarer events, the lack of reporting in clinical trial data does not preclude the possibility of GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Subsection 6.3 indicates that GI bleeding is an identified adverse reaction in post-marketing use, although the frequency is not determined. This kind of evidence comes from real-world use after the drug is approved, where healthcare professionals and patients can report adverse effects to regulatory authorities.

In summary, while GI bleeding may not be a common adverse event in clinical trial data for desvenlafaxine, it is acknowledged as a possible risk associated with its use, particularly based on pharmacological understanding of SNRIs and post-marketing reports. Patients on desvenlafaxine should be monitored for signs of abnormal bleeding, especially if they are concurrently using other medications that increase the risk of bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,dexlansoprazole,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for dexlansoprazole, there is no specific mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or GI ulcers and perforation as a common adverse reaction. However, under the less common adverse reactions in controlled studies, the label does list ""GI ulcents and perforation"" along with a broad range of other gastrointestinal disorders, but without a specific incidence rate or a clear indication of a causal relationship with dexlansoprazole. It is important to note that the term ""GI ulcers and perforation"" can be associated with GI bleeding if the ulcer erodes a blood vessel.

The label does mention other gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and flatulence as among the more common adverse reactions, with diarrhea being the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from dexlansoprazole in controlled clinical studies.

Post-marketing experience, which may include voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, does not list GI bleeding specifically either, although adverse events such as pancreatitis and fundic gland polyps are noted. Post-marketing data, in general, should be interpreted cautiously, as these reports do not always establish a clear causal relationship to drug exposure due to the voluntary nature of reporting and the lack of a control group.

In clinical trials, the safety of dexlansoprazole was evaluated in controlled and single-arm clinical trials involving over 4,500 adult patients, with no specific focus on GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction. Instead, other GI-related adverse reactions were highlighted.

To conclude, the provided label sections for dexlansoprazole do list GI ulcers and perforation under less common adverse reactions but do not provide a direct and specific connection to GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction based on clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance. Thus, while GI bleeding could hypothetically occur within the context of GI ulcers and perforation, there is no clear, direct evidence in the provided sections that GI bleeding is a common or well-characterized adverse reaction specifically attributed to dexlansoprazole. Clinicians should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serious GI adverse events and manage according to current clinical guidelines.",NA
gi bleed,diclofenac,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, the evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and diclofenac exposure can be summarized as follows:

**Clinical Trials:**
The data from clinical trials mentioned in the drug label indicates that GI adverse events, which include abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), and vomiting, have been reported. These events occurred in approximately 1%-10% of patients taking diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
The adverse reactions section of the label also includes GI bleeding as one of the potential adverse effects of diclofenac, which could have been reported through post-marketing surveillance. Post-marketing reports are voluntary and represent a broader population experience since they include all observed adverse events after the drug has been approved and is in use by the general population.

**Box Warning:**
The drug label contains a prominent boxed warning, which underscores the most serious potential side effects of diclofenac. It states that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like diclofenac may cause an increased risk of serious GI adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur anytime during use without warning symptoms. The warning highlights a higher risk for elderly patients and for patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding.

In summary, evidence from clinical trials data and post-marketing reports, as well as the highlighted box warning in the drug label, support the conclusion that there is an established relationship between GI bleeding and the use of diclofenac. Patients at greater risk include the elderly and those with a history of peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding. This information is critical for healthcare providers when making decisions on prescribing diclofenac and for monitoring patients who are on the medication.

Source(s):
- Drug label provided by the user.","NA

The evidence provided in the drug label indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is recognized as a potential adverse reaction of diclofenac. The label explicitly states that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including diclofenac, increase the risk of serious GI adverse events, which include bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. This risk is corroborated by the sections detailing clinical trial experiences and warnings, making it clear that GI bleeding is an established adverse reaction associated with diclofenac use. Therefore, no evidence refuting this relationship is available in the provided drug label information."
gi bleed,diflunisal,1.0,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of diflunisal, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Here is a summary of the relevant data:

1. Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Trials:
   GI bleeding is noted as one of the adverse reactions that occurred less frequently than 1 in 100 patients during clinical trials of diflunisal. Even though this specific adverse event was relatively rare, it was deemed significant enough to be listed, indicating that there is a recognized association between diflunisal and GI bleeding.

2. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   The label also mentions that certain adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was marketed. The list includes peptic ulcers and GI bleeding, which implies that instances of GI bleeding have been observed in the patient population after diflunisal was approved for use. These post-marketing reports serve as real-world evidence that supports the link between diflunisal exposure and GI bleeding.

3. Gastrointestinal Risk Warning:
   The label includes a boxed warning that highlights an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. This warning applies to all NSAIDs, including diflunisal, and indicates that such serious GI adverse events can occur without warning. The elderly are noted to be at greater risk for these events.

In summary, the relationship between GI bleeding and diflunisal exposure is supported by data from controlled clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance reports, and a strong warning about GI risks commonly associated with NSAIDs. This evidence suggests a causal link between diflunisal usage and an increased risk of GI bleeding.","NA

The provided drug label information explicitly lists gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse reaction occurring less frequently than 1 in 100, indicating that there is evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding being a potential adverse reaction of diflunisal. Therefore, it is not possible to provide evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and diflunisal exposure as the adverse reaction is documented in the drug label under the section detailing adverse reactions observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience."
gi bleed,dihematoporphyrin ether,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, specifically hemorrhage, and the use of dihematoporphyrin ether (commercially known as PHOTOFRIN) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), can be summarized from the provided sections of the drug label as follows:

Clinical Trials Evidence:

1. Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1): The clinical trials section reports GI adverse reactions in patients treated with PHOTOFRIN PDT. Specifically, adverse reactions include esophageal edema (8%), hematemesis (8%), and melena (5%) in patients with partially or completely obstructing esophageal cancer. These symptoms suggest upper GI bleeding.

2. Treatment Group Comparisons (Tables 6, 7, 8, 9): Various Tables present data indicating adverse reactions from clinical trials. Notably, Table 6 lists ""hematemesis"" (which refers to vomiting blood, a sign of GI bleed) in 8% of patients with obstructing esophageal cancer and ""tumor hemorrhage"" seen in 8% of patients. Moreover, references to ""massive hemoptysis"" in patients with endobronchial tumors indicate serious respiratory bleeding, which could be interpreted as a severe form of hemorrhage related to the upper GI tract.

Warnings and Precautions Evidence:

1. Pulmonary and Gastroesophageal Hemorrhage (Sections 5.2): The drug label highlights the risks of pulmonary and gastroesophageal hemorrhage, cautioning against use in patients with tumors eroding into blood vessels or esophageal varices. This suggests a known risk of GI bleeding associated with the use of PHOTOFRIN PDT.

2. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2): Although not GI bleed specific, the postmarketing section reports infusion reactions that could be relevant to blood vessel integrity and risk of bleeding, although no direct evidence of GI bleeding is noted here.

Overall, the evidence from the provided sections indicates that there is a recognized risk of GI bleeding, such as pulmonary and gastroesophageal hemorrhage, in patients treated with PHOTOFRIN PDT, as reflected in both the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and the warnings and precautions addressed by the drug label. This risk appears to be specifically associated with the location and nature of tumors being treated, particularly those invading into blood vessels or eroding into the GI tract.

These findings are backed by data reported in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as noted in the relevant sections of the drug label provided. It should be noted that these sources indicate correlation rather than causation, and that in clinical practice, individual patient factors and comorbidities may also contribute to the risk of adverse events such as GI bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,diltiazem,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for diltiazem hydrochloride, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an observed adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions listed under the gastrointestinal category primarily include anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, dysgeusia (distorted taste), dyspepsia (indigestion), mild elevations of liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT, and LDH), thirst, vomiting, and weight increase. None of these explicitly mention GI bleeding.

In the post-marketing events, various reactions have been reported infrequently, including hematologic events such as hemolytic anemia, increased bleeding time, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which are related to blood and its components, but there is no specific reference to GI bleed.

It's essential to recognize that post-marketing surveillance may not capture all possible adverse events, particularly if they are rare or not commonly reported. However, based on the available information from the provided sections, there is no known evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance that establishes a definitive causal relationship between diltiazem exposure and GI bleed. If further research or case reports provide evidence for such an association, it would need to be evaluated to confirm the relationship.

For a comprehensive assessment, healthcare professionals may consult current medical literature, databases, and spontaneous reporting systems for any rare or newly documented cases of GI bleed associated with diltiazem that may not be reflected in the official labeling. It's also important to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities, such as the FDA MedWatch program, to contribute to the monitoring of drug safety.",NA
gi bleed,dinutuximab,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections, there is no direct evidence listed that associates dinutuximab with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction. The Unituxin (dinutuximab) labeling details various adverse reactions, but GI bleeding is not explicitly mentioned as one of the most common or severe side effects observed in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance.

From the data available in the provided sections:

- The ""Adverse Reactions"" section lists common adverse reactions (≥25%) and serious adverse reactions (≥5%) occurring in patients during clinical trials. While gastrointestinal disorders such as vomiting and diarrhea are reported, GI bleed is not specifically identified.
- Adverse reactions of blood and lymphatic system disorders are mentioned, including thrombocytopenia which can potentially contribute to an increased risk of bleeding, but a direct connection to GI bleeding is not made.
- Under the ""Vascular Disorders"" subsection, hemorrhage is mentioned, which includes GI hemorrhage, but the context does not establish it as a common adverse event specifically attributable to dinutuximab as the incidence is not distinguished from other types of hemorrhage incidents.

Considering the available evidence, it appears that while hemorrhagic events are recognized, GI bleeding is not characterized as a frequent or defining adverse reaction to dinutuximab in the clinical trial data provided. It is important to note that this analysis is limited to the excerpt from the drug labeling and does not include a complete review of all available literature or post-marketing reports, where additional evidence may exist. Health care providers should always monitor for any potential adverse effects based on the complete safety profile of the medication and individual patient factors.",NA
gi bleed,docetaxel,,"The provided label extract for docetaxel does not indicate gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction. It does, however, mention that thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported, which could imply that GI bleeding is a possible, albeit rare, consequence of docetaxel-induced thrombocytopenia.

Here is a summary of evidence regarding the potential adverse reaction of GI bleed associated with docetaxel exposure:

- Thrombocytopenia has been observed as an adverse reaction during clinical trials with docetaxel, which could lead to an increased risk of bleeding events, including GI bleed. Table 4 within the provided sections notes an incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients treated with docetaxel.
- The label specifically mentions cases of fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia in breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment.
- Post-marketing surveillance has identified gastrointestinal reactions including enterocolitis, colitis, ischemic colitis, and neutropenic enterocolitis, some of which could potentially result in GI bleeding.

It should be noted that while the evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance signals a potential risk for GI bleed, this adverse reaction is not listed among the most common adverse reactions for docetaxel. It is important to consider individual patient risk factors, such as baseline liver function and platelet counts, when evaluating this potential risk.

In summary, while gastrointestinal bleeding is not listed as a common adverse reaction of docetaxel, there is evidence to suggest that it can occur, particularly in cases of severe thrombocytopenia or in patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction. Healthcare providers should monitor patients for signs of bleeding and manage thrombocytopenia to minimize the risk of GI bleed and other hemorrhagic events.",NA
gi bleed,donepezil,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence pointing towards a relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor used for Alzheimer's disease. Here is a summary of the relevant details:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - Donepezil has been studied in over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide.
   - Common adverse reactions predicted by donepezil's cholinomimetic effects include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia.
   - Rates of some adverse reactions may be influenced by the rate of titration of the drug dosage.
   - Adverse reactions occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age.

2. Warnings and Precautions:
   - Section 5.4 of the drug label provides a specific warning about peptic ulcer disease and GI bleeding as potential risks.
   - Cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil can theoretically increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity, which may predispose patients to peptic ulcers or GI bleeding.
   - Patients at increased risk for these conditions, particularly those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult GI bleeding.
   - Clinical studies ranging from doses of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day of donepezil have not shown an increase compared to placebo in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
   - The label section 6.2 lists adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of donepezil. However, from the provided label information, it does not explicitly list GI bleeding as a postmarketing finding.
   - The reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, which makes it challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to donepezil exposure.

In conclusion, while there is a theoretical basis and a warning on the drug label that donepezil could predispose to peptic ulcers or GI bleeding, the evidence from clinical trials does not show a definitive increased incidence of these conditions compared to placebo. However, close monitoring is recommended in the drug label for symptoms of active or occult GI bleeding, especially in high-risk populations. The absence of explicit postmarketing reports on the drug label for GI bleeding and the nature of voluntary reporting make it difficult to establish the true incidence or strength of the relationship between GI bleeding and donepezil exposure based on available evidence.","The provided drug label excerpts for donepezil, indicated for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type, contain information relevant to the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The label specifically mentions under Warnings and Precautions (5.4) that patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, it also states that clinical studies of donepezil at a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.

This statement suggests that, according to clinical trials included in the drug's approval process, there is no evidence to support an elevated risk of GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease associated with donepezil when compared to placebo. Therefore, based on the available information from clinical trials cited in the medication's labeling, there is evidence refuting the relationship between donepezil and an increased risk of GI bleeding.

It is worth noting that post-marketing experience is not always comprehensive or controlled, and additional adverse reactions outside clinical trials might have been observed. However, any such reports would typically be reflected in updates to the medication's labeling. As no such update is mentioned with regard to GI bleeding in the provided excerpts, it supports the conclusion drawn from the conducted clinical studies.

In conclusion, based on the evidence provided by clinical trials reflected in the drug label for donepezil, there is no increased incidence of GI bleeding associated with the use of donepezil at recommended doses compared to placebo."
gi bleed,doxazosin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for the alpha-1 antagonist doxazosin, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction identified in clinical trials (Section 6.1) or post-marketing experience (Section 6.2). The most commonly reported adverse reactions, according to the clinical trials, include fatigue, malaise, hypotension, and dizziness. Additional adverse reactions that were less frequently reported but considered plausibly related to doxazosin are palpitations, vertigo, hot flushes, epistaxis, edema, and leukopenia/neutropenia, among others. In the post-marketing experience, other adverse reactions have been noted, such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reactions, bradycardia, vomiting, and others. However, GI bleed is not listed among them.

Warnings and precautions detailed in Section 5 reflect concerns related to postural hypotension (5.1), Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (5.2), screening for prostate cancer (5.3), and the risk of priapism (5.4), but do not specifically mention GI bleed as a concern.

In the absence of explicit mention in these sections, it appears there is no known evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance to date that associates doxazosin with an increased risk of GI bleed. As such, this condition is not established as an adverse reaction related to doxazosin based on the information provided.

It is important to note that adverse effects may not always be captured in the initial clinical trials or post-marketing reports, and it is possible that with continued surveillance and reporting, other adverse reactions including GI bleed could be identified in the future. Health care professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to doxazosin to regulatory authorities such as the FDA to facilitate ongoing pharmacovigilance.",NA
gi bleed,duloxetine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and drug exposure to duloxetine can be articulated based on the drug label contents provided, which includes clinical trials, adverse reactions, warnings, and postmarketing surveillance.

1. Adverse Reactions and Warnings:
Under the Warnings and Precautions section (5.5), duloxetine is recognized to potentially increase the risk of bleeding events. This includes an association with gastrointestinal bleeding. This warning suggests that evidence from clinical trials or postmarketing data has indicated an increased risk of GI bleed in patients taking duloxetine, particularly when combined with other medications that may also increase bleeding risk, such as antiplatelets or anticoagulants.

2. Clinical Trials Experience:
GI bleed as an adverse reaction to duloxetine is not explicitly reported in the Clinical Trials Experience section (6.1) for adult patients, where the most commonly observed adverse reactions are listed. However, the absence of GI bleeding in the list does not negate the potential risk, as the Warnings and Precautions section indicates such a relationship.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
Notably, the Postmarketing Experience (6.2), which encompasses adverse reactions identified after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use, does not specifically list GI bleeding. However, other serious events, such as hepatotoxicity, are mentioned, which could potentially be related to GI symptoms.

4. Summary:
- The label explicitly warns about an increased risk of bleeding with duloxetine use, suggesting a recognized relationship, probably based on postmarketing surveillance, even though GI bleed is not specifically listed among the usual adverse reactions from the clinical trials.
- The risk is highlighted when duloxetine is co-administered with antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, or in conditions that inherently increase bleeding risk.
- It is likely that the relationship between GI bleed and duloxetine emerged from a combination of clinical observations, postmarketing reports, and the pharmacological action of the drug, which affects serotonin reuptake and may subsequently affect platelet function and increase bleeding risk.

When assessing the safety profile of duloxetine, healthcare providers should carefully consider the potential for an increased risk of GI bleeding, especially in patients with other factors or concomitant medication use that could compound this risk. Regular monitoring and patient education on signs of GI bleed are warranted. It is important to note that these conclusions are based on the provided sections of the drug label, and more specific data from the original sources of evidence would further substantiate this summary.","The provided drug label for duloxetine does not include GI bleed as a reported common adverse reaction or warning. It does discuss ""Abnormal Bleading"" [see Warnings And Precautions (5.5)] as a serious adverse reaction and increased risk of bleeding events associated with its use, particularly in conjunction with other drugs that affect coagulation, but it does not specifically mention GI bleed. 

Given that gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as an infrequent gastrointestinal disorder in the section ""Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Duloxetine in Adults"" with a disclaimer that these are not necessarily caused by the drug, and given the absence of GI bleed as a highlighted risk in the boxed warnings or other prominent sections of the label, it appears that either:

1. There was no strong evidence directly linking duloxetine to an increased risk of GI bleed during the clinical trials and postmarketing experiences at the time the label was produced, or
2. The incidence may not have been significantly higher than the control (placebo) population or did not meet the threshold for inclusion as a most common adverse reaction.

Therefore, based on the drug label information provided, there is no highlighted evidence specifically supporting the relationship between GI bleed and duloxetine use. However, it should be noted that abnormal bleeding in general is discussed, and healthcare professionals are warned to monitor patients for bleeding when duloxetine is used, particularly in combination with other medications that influence bleeding risk. It is essential to review additional literature and clinical data beyond the drug label to fully assess the evidence regarding the relationship between GI bleed and duloxetine use."
gi bleed,eletriptan,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for eletriptan, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a recognized adverse reaction observed in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions listed predominantly include asthenia, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and various cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, chest pain, vasospasm reactions). Abdominal pain and discomfort are mentioned as potential adverse reactions, but without any direct link to GI bleeding reported in the clinical trials data provided.

In the post-marketing experience section, vomiting is mentioned as an identified adverse reaction, but again, there is no direct reference to GI bleeding. It is important to note that post-marketing adverse reactions may not cover all possible adverse events due to voluntary reporting and uncertainty around the exact incidence rate.

The ""Warnings and Precautions"" section refers to the possibility of other vasospasm reactions, including gastrointestinal ischemia or infarction, which presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. While ischemic events in the GI tract could potentially lead to bleeding, this is not the same as directly citing GI bleeding as an adverse reaction.

In summary, there is no clearly established evidence within the provided drug label sections that GI bleed is a recognized adverse reaction from the exposure to eletriptan based on clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance. However, given that gastrointestinal ischemia or infarction is listed as a potential vasospasm reaction, clinicians should be vigilant when monitoring patients who are at risk or show symptoms indicative of gastrointestinal issues while on eletriptan. It is important for health care providers to report such adverse reactions to further improve the drug's safety profile if they do observe GI bleeding in practice.",NA
gi bleed,emapalumab,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for emapalumab (GAMIFANT), there is evidence supporting a relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and drug exposure during clinical trials. GI bleeding, specifically classified as a serious adverse reaction, was observed in more than 3% of patients, indicating a notable frequency among the study population.

The safety data reflects exposure to emapalumab in a clinical trial involving 34 patients with primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) who received the drug at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg every three days, with potential dose increases up to 10 mg/kg. During this clinical trial, the most common serious adverse reactions included infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and multiple organ dysfunction. Additionally, there were reports of fatal adverse reactions, with two patients (6%) experiencing gastrointestinal hemorrhage that contributed to their deaths.

Apart from the GI hemorrhage observed in the clinical trials, evidence from the post-marketing experience or case studies specific to GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to emapalumab has not been provided here. Therefore, one can infer that the association between GI bleeding and emapalumab is primarily derived from clinical trial data.

It is important to note that while the safety profile reported in the clinical trial suggests an association between emapalumab and GI bleeding, further investigation such as post-marketing surveillance and additional studies could provide more substantial evidence to fully characterize this potential adverse reaction.

In conclusion, the evidence from a clinical trial involving patients with primary HLH indicates that GI bleeding is an adverse reaction associated with emapalumab. Additionally, fatal adverse reactions related to GI bleeding were reported. However, no further evidence from post-marketing surveillance or case studies has been presented.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes GI bleed, is listed as one of the most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 3%) in patients treated with emapalumab (GAMIFANT). Additionally, it is noted that fatal adverse reactions included gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Therefore, there is evidence of a relationship between GI bleed and emapalumab exposure, and no evidence refuting this relationship can be provided from the given information."
gi bleed,encorafenib,,"The provided drug label information for encorafenib (BRAFTOVI) indicates an association between the use of the drug and various adverse reactions. Specifically related to gastrointestinal adverse reactions, the label mentions that hemorrhage as an adverse event is described in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.5). According to the Evidence Supporting the Relationship section, the potential association between encorafenib use and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) adverse events can be summarized as follows:

1. Clinical Trials Experience:
   - The COLUMBUS trial reported that hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving encorafenib in combination with binimetinib, with Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage in 3.2% of these patients. Hemorrhagic events primarily affected the gastrointestinal tract, inclusive of rectal hemorrhage and hematochezia.
   - In the BEACON CRC trial, hemorrhage was also reported in 19% of patients receiving encorafenib in combination with cetuximab. Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhages occurred in 1.9% of patients, and there was one reported instance of fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
   - The PHAROS trial indicated that hemorrhage occurred in 12% of patients receiving encorafenib in combination with binimetinib, with one instance of fatal intracranial hemorrhage and Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhages in 4.1% of patients.

2. Warnings and Precautions:
   - Major hemorrhagic events are listed as possible complications in patients who are on encorafenib and binimetinib. The recommendation includes withholding, reducing the dose, or permanently discontinuing encorafenib based on the severity of the adverse reaction.

3. Post-marketing Surveillance:
   - As of the data presented, there is no specific post-marketing surveillance information provided for GI bleeding associated with encorafenib use.

Based on the evidence from the clinical trials, there is a documented risk of GI bleed in patients treated with encorafenib, particularly when used in combination with other agents such as binimetinib or cetuximab. Clinicians are advised to monitor for signs of bleeding and to manage patients appropriately, which may include dose alterations or discontinuation of the medication. No specific information from post-marketing surveillance is provided, but healthcare professionals and patients are instructed to report suspected adverse reactions to Pfizer Inc. or the FDA.

The summarized evidence comes from the adverse reactions and warnings sections of the encorafenib drug label. As this information is derived from controlled clinical trials, it provides substantial evidence of an association between encorafenib use and the potential for GI bleeding as an adverse reaction.",NA
gi bleed,enfortumab,,"Based on the drug label provided, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing experience for enfortumab vedotin (PADCEV). The adverse reactions included in the report focus on the most common occurrences and other significant concerns, such as skin reactions, hyperglycemia, pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD), peripheral neuropathy, and ocular disorders. Additionally, adverse reactions observed in a severity of ≥15% and selected laboratory abnormalities in various studies (EV-302, EV-103, EV-301, EV-201) have been detailed without listing GI bleed.

GI bleed is not listed among the adverse reactions or warnings that occurred in the clinical trial populations across multiple studies or in the post-marketing experience. Therefore, based on the information provided in the sections for adverse reactions (6), warnings, and box warnings, there is no known evidence to support a relationship between GI bleed and enfortumab vedotin exposure.

For the most current and comprehensive information, further investigation beyond the provided label, such as a search within databases of clinical studies, literature reviews, and additional post-marketing surveillance data, would be important if concerns about GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction to enfortumab vedotin remain. If any new evidence has emerged post-knowledge cutoff, it would not be captured in this summary.","NA

The provided drug label sections, including adverse reactions (section 6), warnings, and box warnings, do not mention gastrointestinal bleeding (gi bleed) as a known adverse reaction to enfortumab vedotin (PADCEV). Therefore, based on the provided sections of the drug label, no evidence is available to suggest that gi bleed is an adverse reaction related to the administration of enfortumab vedotin."
gi bleed,eptifibatide,,"Clinical trials, including the Phase III PURSUIT, ESPRIT, and IMPACT II studies, have documented bleeding incidents as a significant adverse reaction associated with eptifibatide, primarily in the context of increased bleeding events at the vascular access site for cardiac catheterization or gastrointestinal bleeding. For instance, in the PURSUIT study, eptifibatide treatment was associated with higher rates of major bleeding (10.8%) compared to placebo (9.3%). The ESPRIT study similarly reported increased bleeding rates with eptifibatide treatment, with major bleeding in 1.3% of patients compared to 0.4% in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal bleeding, although not specified in the table, is included in gastrointestinal sites where increased bleeding risk has been observed in eptifibatide-treated groups.

Post-marketing surveillance further corroborates the evidence from clinical trials by reporting gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as an adverse reaction following the approval of eptifibatide, although precise frequencies are difficult to ascertain due to the spontaneous nature of these reports.

The drug label clearly states bleeding is the most common adverse reaction associated with eptifibatide. While gastrointestinal bleeding is not separately detailed in clinical trial results, the broader category of bleeding adverse events, which encompasses GI bleed, is noted as being significantly associated with eptifibatide, especially when compared to placebo.

In summary, evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding and eptifibatide use comes from clinical trials that have demonstrated increased incidence of bleeding in eptifibatide-treated groups, as well as post-marketing surveillance that indicates reported cases of GI bleeding as an adverse reaction. The provided drug label offers comprehensive information on this risk, specifically warning healthcare professionals and patients about the potential for serious bleeding complications during eptifibatide therapy.",NA
gi bleed,erlotinib,,"The drug label provided for erlotinib includes a comprehensive list of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, directions for warnings and precautions, and a summary of post-marketing experience.

**Evidence from Clinical Trials**:
Specifically looking for evidence supporting gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction of erlotinib:

- Erlotinib has been associated with Gastrointestinal Perforation (Section 5.4 of the drug label), which can lead to severe GI adverse events including GI bleed. The incidences in monotherapy lung cancer studies were 0.2% for erlotinib-treated patients versus 0.1% in control arms. In a study of pancreatic cancer, the incidence was 0.4% with erlotinib plus gemcitabine, and 0% with the control.

**Evidence from Post-Marketing Experience**:
- Cases of GI bleeding (including fatalities) have been reported post-marketing (Section 6.2). These events have been associated with the concomitant use of warfarin or NSAIDs and is included in the warnings and precautions (Section 5.9).

Overall, clinical trial data and post-marketing reports support the association of GI bleed with erlotinib, especially when used concomitantly with other drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding, such as warfarin or NSAIDs. It's important to note that while the incidence may appear low, GI bleeding is a serious adverse event that can be fatal.

Please consider the above summary for evidence-based decision-making, and always consult the full product labeling in conjunction with understanding individual patient factors that might contribute to the risk of such adverse reactions.",NA
gi bleed,ertapenem,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ertapenem (INVANZ), the evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction is not explicitly stated in the common adverse reactions for adults or pediatric patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in adults include diarrhea, nausea, headache, and infused vein complications; similarly, in pediatric patients, they included diarrhea, vomiting, and infusion site pain.

In the Digestive System subsection of the post-marketing experience, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as an additional adverse event. While gastrointestinal hemorrhage can sometimes be interpreted to include GI bleeds, it is important to note that these are voluntarily reported events from a population of uncertain size, which makes it difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a clear causal relationship to drug exposure. Therefore, while there is a mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a post-marketing finding, the label does not provide strong evidence that a GI bleed is a common adverse reaction directly associated with ertapenem.

For a definitive causal relationship between ertapenem and GI bleed to be established, more detailed studies such as controlled clinical trials or well-documented case studies would need to demonstrate this association. As it stands from the label information, it appears to be a potential adverse reaction but not among the most commonly reported or well-characterized side effects.",NA
gi bleed,escitalopram,1.0,"The provided drug label for escitalopram (often known by the brand name Lexapro) extensively details the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and reported through post-marketing experience. However, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or more specifically, GI bleed, is not prominently featured among the commonly observed adverse reactions (≥ 5% and at least twice the incidence of placebo) in the provided label sections.

Clinical Trials:
In the clinical trials section (6.1), the most commonly observed adverse reactions included insomnia, ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay), nausea, increased sweating, fatigue, somnolence, decreased libido, and anorgasmia.

Post-Marketing Experience:
Section 6.2 lists adverse reactions reported after the approval of escitalopram. It mentions ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" as a post-marketing observation but does not provide a frequency or establish a definite causal relationship to escitalopram exposure. It is important to consider that post-marketing reports are voluntarily submitted and can vary in detail and reliability.

Warnings and Precautions:
In the Warnings and Precautions section (5.7), the label does note an ""Increased Risk of Bleeding"" with the concurrent use of escitalopram and antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs, or anticoagulants, suggesting a potential mechanism by which escitalopram could contribute to GI bleeding when combined with these other drugs.

Summary:
Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no strong and direct evidence listed within clinical trials that explicitly connects escitalopram use alone with the occurrence of GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction. There is mention of ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" in post-marketing reports, which indicates that such events have been observed in patients taking the drug, but information on frequency and causality is not specified. Additionally, there is acknowledgment of an increased risk of bleeding, particularly when escitalopram is used alongside other drugs that affect coagulation. Therefore, while it's not conclusively presented as a frequent adverse reaction of escitalopram, there is a plausible association between escitalopram and increased bleeding risk, which may include GI bleeding, especially when taken with other medications that affect bleeding risk. Healthcare professionals are advised to monitor patients for signs of bleeding and consider these risks when prescribing escitalopram, especially in combination with other agents that affect hemostasis.",NA
gi bleed,esomeprazole,,"Based on the provided sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS, 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) from the drug label for esomeprazole, there is a mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI hemorrhage) under less common adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% in the section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience. Specifically, ""Gastrointestinal: bowel irregularity, constipation aggravated, dyspepsia, dysphagia, dysplasia GI, epigastric pain, eructation, esophageal disorder, frequent stools, gastroenteritis, GI hemorrhage, GI symptoms not otherwise specified, hiccup, melena, mouth disorder, pharynx disorder, rectal disorder, serum gastrin increased, tongue disorder, tongue edema, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting;"" list gastrointestinal hemorrhage as one of the adverse reactions observed in patients during clinical trials, although less common.

GI bleeding or hemorrhage is a known potential adverse effect of many proton pump inhibitors, including esomeprazole. This stems from their mechanism of action, which involves reducing the production of stomach acid — potentially leading to a decreased protective effect of the stomach lining and an increased risk of bleeding, especially when used concomitantly with other medications that can increase this risk.

However, please note that a direct cause-and-effect relationship between esomeprazole and GI bleeding can be complex and may involve multiple factors. In clinical practice, the possibility of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to esomeprazole would be based on the patient's overall clinical picture, including their medical history, concomitant medications, and any underlying conditions that may predispose them to bleeding.

In terms of post-marketing surveillance, section 6.2 states that adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, and it is therefore not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Although GI bleed is not explicitly mentioned in the post-marketing experience section for esomeprazole provided, the inherent limitations of voluntary reporting should be taken into account.

In summary, GI hemorrhage is listed as an adverse event with less than 1% incidence in clinical trials of esomeprazole. The warning and precaution sections of the label do not specifically highlight GI bleeding as a significant risk factor, but the general risk associated with all proton pump inhibitors should be taken into account. Careful consideration should be given when prescribing esomeprazole, particularly in patients with additional risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,estramustine,,"Based on the drug label information provided, there is evidence to suggest gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of estramustine. In the adverse reactions section of a randomized, double-blind trial comparing estramustine (EMCYT Capsules, 11.5 to 15.9 mg/kg/day) and diethylstilbestrol (DES, 3.0 mg/day) in a total of 186 patients, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in one case (1/93 patients, approximately 1.08%) in the cohort treated with estramustine.

There are no further details provided regarding this case, such as the severity of the GI bleed, any predisposing factors, the timing relative to drug exposure, or any other medications that the patient might have been taking concurrently that could have contributed to this adverse reaction. Additionally, no information is provided about the incidence of GI bleed from post-marketing surveillance or from other clinical studies, which might be necessary to establish a causal relationship more robustly.

In conclusion, the drug label indicates one reported instance of GI bleeding in a clinical trial with estramustine, suggesting a possible association. However, due to the lack of detailed information and corroborating evidence from other sources, it is difficult to draw a clear causal link based on this single case. Further information from case studies, additional clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance would be necessary to definitively determine the strength of the relationship between GI bleed and estramustine exposure.","NA

The data presented from the drug label does not provide evidence refuting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the adverse reactions of estramustine. GI bleeding is listed as an adverse reaction occurring in 1 out of 93 patients treated with estramustine in the provided clinical trial section. Without additional information or studies directly examining and refuting the relationship, it cannot be stated that there is no association. Therefore, GI bleed remains recognized as a potential adverse reaction of estramustine based on the supplied drug label information."
gi bleed,ethacrynate,,"Based on the drug label sections provided, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is listed as an adverse reaction that has occurred in some patients taking ethacrynate (ethacrynic acid), which is a loop diuretic medication.

The evidence for the relationship between GI bleed and ethacrynic acid exposure, according to the label, appears to be derived from post-marketing surveillance since the label mentions that gastrointestinal bleeding ""has occurred in some patients."" This suggests that the occurrence was noted after the drug was marketed, as it did not specify that the finding came from clinical trials.

There is no additional detail provided regarding the frequency, severity, or specific circumstances under which GI bleeding has been observed (e.g., doses associated with increased risk, patient characteristics, or concurrent medical conditions). Clinical trials are not mentioned, which might imply that this potential adverse reaction was not a notable finding in the original controlled trials, or if it was, that the trials were not referenced directly in the label regarding this particular side effect.

Furthermore, there is no mention of any case studies specifically linked to GI bleed related to ethacrynate, but the drug label does advise that severe diarrhea, which could potentially contribute to GI disturbances and complications, should lead to discontinuation of the medication.

Given the nature of adverse reaction reports, it is important to note that these are often gathered through voluntary reporting systems, which can be subject to underreporting and lack of comprehensive clinical detail. Therefore, the evidence for GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction of ethacrynate comes from post-marketing experience. To get more detailed and specific information, additional clinical studies or case report analyses would be required.

For healthcare providers and patients, it's important to consider this potential risk when using ethacrynate, and to report any observed adverse effects to help refine the understanding of the drug's safety profile. The actual source of the GI bleed should always be investigated to rule out other causes unrelated to the medication.

Reference:
- The drug label sections provided (adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings).",NA
gi bleed,etodolac,1.0,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the exposure to etodolac, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The evidence is summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials:
- Adverse reactions to etodolac were determined from 2,629 patients who participated in both double-blind and open-label clinical trials lasting from 4 to 320 weeks, as well as worldwide postmarketing surveillance studies. These trials found that gastrointestinal experiences such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), and vomiting occurred in approximately 1 to 10% of patients.
- Among 465 patients with osteoarthritis treated with 300 to 500 mg of etodolac twice daily (600 to 1000 mg/day), GI-related complaints such as dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea occurred at an incidence greater than or equal to 1%, suggesting a probable causal relationship.
- Instances of melena (dark, tarry stools indicative of GI bleeding) were noted as part of the adverse reactions within the digestive system.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- Adverse reactions that were not observed in the clinical trials but were identified during postmarketing experience (which makes them rarer) included serious GI events such as peptic ulcer with or without bleeding and/or perforation, intestinal ulceration, and pancreatitis.
- Gastrointestinal risk of NSAIDs is indicated as causing an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal.
- Additional adverse reactions reported with NSAIDs include other gastrointestinal issues such as gastric ulcers, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematemesis (vomiting blood).

Warnings:
- The label includes explicit warnings about the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events relating to NSAID use, stating that these drugs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, which can be fatal. It is highlighted that these events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms and that elderly patients are at greater risk for these serious events.

In summary, the drug label of etodolac provides evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicating that GI bleed is a known adverse reaction to etodolac use. The drug label also explicitly warns about the risks of serious gastrointestinal events associated with etodolac and other NSAIDs.",NA
gi bleed,etravirine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for etravirine, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a specifically identified adverse drug reaction from the clinical trial data or postmarketing experience. The sections provided detail a range of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, but GI bleeding, such as hematemesis (vomiting of blood), which might suggest upper GI bleeding, is mentioned only once under gastrointestinal disorders and is not characterized as a common adverse reaction.

To summarize, from the available details:
- The most common moderate to severe adverse drug reactions in adults were rash and peripheral neuropathy.
- In pediatric patients, the most common adverse reactions were rash and diarrhea.
- Less common adverse reactions included a range of disorders, with one mention of hematemesis but no explicit note of GI bleeding as a categorized event.
- Postmarketing experience reported severe hypersensitivity reactions and cases of hepatic failure, among others, but again no specific notation of GI bleeding.

It is important to consider that postmarketing surveillance might capture a broader set of adverse reactions as the patient population exposed to the drug increases beyond the controlled environment of clinical trials. However, based on the provided information, GI bleed does not appear to be an established adverse reaction to etravirine. For confirmation and the most current understanding, it would be wise to consult the most recent full prescribing information, conduct a literature review, and report any adverse events to pharmacovigilance databases.",NA
gi bleed,etravirine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for etravirine (INTELENCE), there is no direct evidence listed that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), such as hematemesis or melena, is a common adverse reaction of etravirine in the studied populations. This conclusion is drawn from the clinical trials experience and post-marketing surveillance data as cited in the label.

Clinical Trials Experience:
In the clinical trials cited (TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216) which included 1203 adult subjects, common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity included rash and peripheral neuropathy, but GI bleed was not mentioned as a common adverse event. Specific gastrointestinal (GI)-related adverse reactions did occur, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, abdominal distension, pancreatitis, constipation, and dry mouth, but hematemesis was reported in less than 2% of subjects in these Phase 3 trials and is not stated as a common reaction.

Postmarketing Experience:
The post-marketing experience section of the label lists severe hypersensitivity reactions and skin disorders under the adverse reactions reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size. While severe adverse reactions are mentioned, including cases of hepatic failure (which may include GI bleeding as a symptom), GI bleed as an individual reaction is not explicitly reported.

Warnings and Precautions:
The GI bleed does not appear in the warnings and precautions section, which highlights severe skin reactions and the risk of immune reconstitution syndrome among others.

A search of the reported GI-related laboratory abnormalities (e.g., pancreatic amylase and lipase elevations) shows potential pancreatitis which could, in theory, be associated indirectly with upper GI bleeding, but this is not the same as stating that GI bleed is a known adverse reaction of the drug.

In summary, while the provided label mentions various adverse reactions and warnings relating to etravirine, a direct relationship between GI bleed and etravirine is not established in the information presented. Given the absence of explicit evidence linking etravirine to GI bleed as a common adverse reaction, it is not reported as such. However, it is important to be vigilant in monitoring patients and to consider that post-marketing reports may not capture all possible adverse reactions. Healthcare professionals should report any suspected adverse reactions through appropriate channels to help in building a comprehensive safety profile for the drug.","Based on the provided drug label sections for etravirine, there is no mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction in either the clinical trial data or the post-marketing experience. The adverse reactions listed for etravirine do primarily include skin reactions, such as rash and hypersensitivity reactions, as well as other systemic and organ-specific effects, but GI bleeding is not referenced.

This absence of mention in the key sections that outline known adverse reactions and warnings (sections 6: Adverse Reactions, 6.1: Clinical Trials Experience, 6.2: Postmarketing Experience, and 5: Warnings and Precautions) suggests that GI bleeding has not been established as a related adverse reaction to etravirine based on the available clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance up to the knowledge cutoff date.

Therefore, while this is not direct evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleeding and etravirine, the absence of such information in the official drug label implies that there is no recognized association between GI bleeding and etravirine at this time. For the most definitive conclusion, further direct clinical studies focused on investigating the potential for GI bleeding as an adverse reaction of etravirine would be required."
gi bleed,everolimus,,"Based on the drug label information provided for everolimus (AFINITOR), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction or under the warnings and precautions. There is also no mention of GI bleed in the sections detailing the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1) or the postmarketing experience (Section 6.2).

The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials include stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite among others. Serious adverse reactions such as non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, and renal failure are highlighted, with specific instructions on how to manage such reactions (Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.6).

While GI bleed is not directly mentioned, it is important to note that adverse reactions such as stomatitis and other gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported. However, these do not necessarily equate to or imply a higher incidence of GI bleed.

Postmarketing experience (Section 6.2) lists additional adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials, such as thrombotic microangiopathy and acute pancreatitis, but GI bleed is not reported here either.

In summary, there is no explicit evidence in the provided sections of the everolimus drug label supporting a relationship between GI bleed and drug exposure. If there is any suspicion of such a relationship, it would require further investigation, including a review of the full spectrum of clinical data, case studies, and postmarketing surveillance reports that are not provided here. Healthcare professionals reporting GI bleeds as an adverse reaction to everolimus should be encouraged to submit these reports to drug regulatory agencies for further evaluation.",NA
gi bleed,everolimus,,"The provided drug label sections on everolimus detail the adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings associated with its use. Regarding gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction to everolimus, there is no explicit mention of this specific condition within the provided sections of the drug label.

However, it's important to parse the information given for any indirect references or related conditions. Some adverse reactions listed, such as ""abdominal pain"" and ""hematemesis"" (vomiting blood), could potentially be symptoms associated with a GI bleed. Additionally, ""hemorrhoids,"" which can sometimes bleed, are referenced. In the context of liver transplantation, ""hepatic enzyme increased,"" ""bilirubin increased,"" and ""hepatitis (non-infectious)"" may suggest pathology related to the liver, which in turn could potentially be related to GI bleeding in some circumstances.

The drug label does highlight that everolimus comes with an increased risk of serious infections and development of malignancies such as lymphoma and skin cancer (Section 5.2), as well as renal concerns (Sections 5.5 and 5.6); these areas are more heavily emphasized in terms of adverse reactions.

It is important to note the Post Marketing Experience (Section 6.3), which does not explicitly mention GI bleeding, thus suggesting that such a side effect has not been prevalent or directly linked to everolimus during post-marketing surveillance.

In conclusion, based on the supplied information, there is no explicit evidence within the drug label sections to suggest that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction to everolimus. If such evidence exists, it would not be found within the provided text, and further information from additional clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance would be required to establish a definitive relationship.

Healthcare providers should monitor patients for any signs and symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of a GI bleed, especially if other risk factors are present, and report any suspected adverse reactions associated with everolimus use as per standard pharmacovigilance practices.",NA
gi bleed,febuxostat,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for febuxostat, gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials data summarized in the label. In the adverse reactions table, gastrointestinal-related events such as nausea, liver function abnormalities, and diarrhea are mentioned as reactions in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat, but not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo or allopurinol.

However, there is mention of less common gastrointestinal disorders observed in clinical studies, including gastritis, gastrointestinal discomfort, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and peptic ulcer, which occurred in less than 1% of patients. These findings suggest a potential association with gastrointestinal tract conditions that could lead to GI bleeding, but the evidence does not directly connect febuxostat with GI bleed as a typical adverse event.

In the postmarketing experience, which encompasses reports from healthcare providers and patients after the drug has been approved and is in widespread use, there does not appear to be specific mention of GI bleed as an identified adverse reaction.

Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no clear and direct evidence from clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance that establishes GI bleed as a recognized adverse reaction to febuxostat.

In the absence of specific data reporting GI bleed as an adverse event related to febuxostat use, it is important for healthcare providers to monitor patients for any signs of GI bleeding, especially those with pre-existing conditions that predispose them to this risk, and to report any suspected adverse events to regulatory authorities to build a more comprehensive understanding of the drug's safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,febuxostat,,"After evaluating the provided drug label information for ULORIC (febuxostat), there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction in clinical trials, warnings, or post-marketing experience specifically related to this medication. The label does describe other gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, but GI bleed is not listed among the common or less common adverse reactions.

Adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with ULORIC and at least 0.5% greater than placebo are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash, according to Table 1 in the provided label information. Less common adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disorders like abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and flatulence, yet there is no specific mention of GI bleed.

During postmarketing experience, a range of adverse reactions have been identified, but GI bleed is not explicitly mentioned in this context either. There are references to hepatic failure and other hepatobiliary disorders, but these do not involve GI bleeding as a direct adverse effect.

In the absence of explicit data or reported cases linking febuxostat to GI bleed within clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, or label warnings, it can be concluded that as of the provided information, there is no known evidence supporting a direct relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and febuxostat use. However, healthcare professionals should monitor patients for any adverse effects and report newly identified reactions to drug regulatory agencies to ensure comprehensive post-marketing surveillance. 

If further research or case reports become available that suggest an association, the relationship between febuxostat and GI bleed would need to be re-evaluated. Healthcare providers should also be aware that while not documented in the label, GI bleed can be a complex condition with multifactorial causes, and a comprehensive assessment of each patient's clinical picture is essential when investigating potential adverse drug reactions.",NA
gi bleed,felbamate,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for felbamate, there appears to be no direct evidence cited within the provided text linking felbamate to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions detailed for both adult and pediatric populations include a variety of symptoms, primarily affecting the central nervous system, digestive system, body as a whole, and dermatological effects. GI-related adverse reactions mentioned in the text include nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, hepatobiliary disorders such as hepatitis and hepatic failure, and other specifics like pancreatitis and gastritis. However, GI bleeding is not listed among the frequent, infrequent, or rare adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, during post-marketing surveillance, or in any specific case studies within the provided drug label information.

In the section labeled ""Digestive:"" under ""Post-marketing Adverse Event Reports,"" gastrointestinal hemorrhage is mentioned as a post-marketing adverse experience along with a variety of other GI concerns. However, this passage also includes a caveat indicating that these voluntary reports of adverse events may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of felbamate, as these reports include patients who may have been taking felbamate along with other drugs.

Additionally, under the ""Warning"" section, there is no specific mention of GI bleeding as a recognized severe adverse event or boxed warning like there is for aplastic anemia and hepatic failure. This indicates that while GI bleeding might have been reported, it is not a characterized or prominent risk that necessitates a boxed warning or specific highlighted caution in the same manner as aplastic anemia or liver failure.

In conclusion, while GI bleeding has been reported post-marketing, there is no clear or direct evidence from the provided label sections that establishes a definitive causal relationship between felbamate and GI bleeding. It should be noted that post-marketing reports are a less robust form of evidence compared to controlled clinical trials, as they can be influenced by various confounding factors and do not typically provide a comprehensive assessment of causality. Therefore, while GI bleeding is not entirely absent from the label, it is not characterized as a common or well-established adverse reaction attributed to felbamate based on the evidence presented in the drug label. Further investigation through targeted studies would be required to understand and quantify this potential risk better.","Based on the provided drug label sections for felbamate, there is no evidence listed that explicitly refutes the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and felbamate use. The adverse reactions section details the most common reactions observed, and GI hemorrhage is not mentioned as a frequent, infrequent, or rare event. However, it is important to note that post-marketing reports, which may include voluntary submissions from healthcare providers and patients, mention ""G.I. hemorrhage"" under the Digestive system subsection. The causal relationship between felbamate and these reports is unclear, as the drug label states that these reports ""may have no causal relationship with the drug(s).""

Given the lack of direct evidence refuting GI bleed as an adverse reaction to felbamate and the mention of GI hemorrhage in the post-marketing adverse event reports (though without established causality), it cannot be conclusively stated that no relationship exists. Therefore, the response to the inquiry is not ""NA"" but rather an acknowledgment of the absence of direct refuting evidence, coupled with the existence of at least some post-marketing reports of GI hemorrhage that may or may not be related to felbamate use."
gi bleed,fenoprofen,1.0,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of fenoprofen, an NSAID. This evidence is presented in various parts of the label, detailed as follows:

1. **Adverse Reactions Section (6):** GI bleeding is listed as one of the adverse reactions that are discussed in greater detail in the warnings and precautions section of the labeling. Additionally, under Adverse Drug Reactions Reported in <1% of Patients During Clinical Trials, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is specifically mentioned as one of the adverse reactions observed.

2. **Clinical Trials Experience (6.1):** This section notes that during clinical trials of fenoprofen, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred in 20.8% of patients taking fenoprofen compared to 16.9% receiving placebo. Gastrointestinal effects included dyspepsiain (fenoprofen 10.3% vs. placebo 2.3%) and nausea, among others, indicating a higher incidence of GI-related side effects in fenoprofen-treated patients. Although not reported to a high percentage, gastritis, peptic ulcer with/without perforation, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reported as adverse reactions during clinical trials, which supports the relationship between fenoprofen and GI bleeding.

3. **Boxed Warnings:** The label contains a boxed warning, which is the FDA's strongest warning, indicating that NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, can cause an increased risk of serious adverse GI events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. This risk is emphasized for patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding, who are at even greater risk.

4. **Warnings and Precautions (5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation):** It is stated that serious GI adverse events can occur at any time during treatment with fenoprofen and without warning symptoms. The risk of upper GI adverse events (ulcers, bleeding, perforation) ranges from 1% for short-term use to 2%-4% for one-year use. The label recommends strategies to minimize these risks, which reflects the recognition of a strong association between fenoprofen use and GI bleeding risks.

5. **Post-Marketing Experience:** While specific post-marketing surveillance data isn't provided in the excerpt, it can be inferred that such data might exist given the detailed warnings and the reporting mechanism for suspected adverse reactions (as indicated in the adverse reactions section).

In summary, both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as reflected in the drug label information, provide evidence that GI bleeding is a potential adverse reaction of fenoprofen usage. Patients are at risk of serious GI events, including bleeding, especially with longer duration of use or pre-existing conditions. The boxed warning also underscores the severity of this adverse reaction.",NA
gi bleed,fentanyl,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for fentanyl buccal tablets, there is evidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with the use of this drug. However, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a direct adverse reaction. The documented gastrointestinal disorders include nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, dry mouth, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, dysphagia, gingival pain, stomach discomfort, gastroesophageal reflux disease, glossodynia, and mouth ulceration.

The clinical studies section (6.1) describes the safety of fentanyl buccal tablets evaluated in 304 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. Following the adverse event data presented, nausea and vomiting related to gastrointestinal disorders appear to be the most prevalent, experienced by 17% and 5% of patients during titration, respectively. During long-term treatment, nausea was present in 29% and vomiting in 40% of patients.

The increased incidence of application site reactions, which occurred in 10% of patients and ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding, should be noted. While ulceration and bleeding were reported at the application sites in the mouth, this does not confirm that fentanyl causes gastrointestinal bleeding elsewhere in the digestive tract.

In the post-marketing experience section (6.2), various other adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of fentanyl are listed, but gastrointestinal bleeding is not specifically mentioned.

In the safety information, under Warnings and Precautions (5.15), it is noted that fentanyl as an active substance can cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and might affect patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. While this implies an impact on the gastrointestinal system, it does not provide direct evidence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to fentanyl.

Therefore, while the drug label does discuss gastrointestinal adverse reactions, there is no clear evidence within the drug label information provided that directly associates fentanyl with causing gastrointestinal bleeding. Clinical trials and additional post-marketing surveillance data specific to GI bleed as an adverse reaction to fentanyl buccal tablets do not appear to be available or specified within the given sections of the drug label.","NA

Based on the provided label sections for fentanyl, GI bleed is not listed as an identified adverse reaction associated with the use of fentanyl buccal tablets. The sections provided detail numerous potential adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions related to fentanyl use, but gastrointestinal bleeding is not explicitly mentioned as a known adverse event. It is, however, important to consider that while GI bleed is not explicitly reported in these sections, opioids, in general, can affect gastrointestinal motility, and individual responses may vary. If there is concern about a potential adverse reaction that is not listed, healthcare providers often report such incidents to pharmacovigilance systems for further evaluation."
gi bleed,fidaxomicin,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for fidaxomicin (marketed as DIFICID), there is evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and drug exposure from clinical trials. In the section on clinical trials experience, it is reported that GI hemorrhage occurred in 4% of adult patients treated with fidaxomicin. This data is derived from two active-controlled trials involving 564 adult patients with Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). The reported incidence provides direct evidence that GI bleed is an adverse reaction associated with fidaxomicin in a clinical trial setting, as it is a selected adverse reaction with an incidence of ≥2% in the controlled trials.

Furthermore, there is no mention of a boxed warning related to GI bleeding, which suggests that while the reaction has been observed, it may not be considered a reaction with a sufficiently high risk to warrant the most severe form of warning from the FDA.

However, the drug label does not mention any case studies or post-marketing surveillance data specifically pertaining to GI bleed as an adverse reaction to fidaxomicin. The post-marketing experience section lists hypersensitivity reactions but does not provide additional information about GI hemorrhage following approval. This absence suggests that, up to the knowledge cutoff date, there are no reported data from post-marketing surveillance that would further quantify the risk of GI bleed outside of the context of clinical trials.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials indicates that GI bleed is a reported adverse reaction in a significant number of patients (4%) treated with fidaxomicin, providing a direct link between the drug exposure and the potential adverse reaction of GI bleeding. However, no additional evidence from post-marketing surveillance has been indicated in the provided drug label sections to further assess this relationship in general practice beyond clinical trial settings.",NA
gi bleed,fidaxomicin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as an adverse reaction and fidaxomicin (marketed as DIFICID) exposure includes data from clinical trials. According to Section 6.1 of the drug label, GI hemorrhage is one of the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of adult patients treated with DIFICID in controlled trials, with an incidence of 4% in fidaxomicin-treated patients compared to 2% in patients treated with vancomycin.

The safety of fidaxomicin was evaluated in two active-controlled trials involving 564 adult patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), out of which 20 (4%) patients experienced gastrointestinal hemorrhage. This information is provided in the context of adverse reactions in adults and suggests a direct observation of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of fidaxomicin during clinical trials.

The clinical trial data is further supported by post-marketing experience, as mentioned in Section 6.2 of the drug label, although specific incidence rates for GI bleed as an adverse reaction during post-marketing surveillance are not provided. Since this information is based on voluntary reporting from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to estimate the exact frequency or establish a causal relationship to fidaxomicin exposure.

No specific case studies are referenced in the provided sections of the drug label, nor are there any boxed warnings or specific warnings and precautions relevant to GI bleed listed. Additionally, there are no mentions of GI bleed as an adverse reaction in pediatric patients treated with fidaxomicin based on the provided label information.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials supports the relationship between GI bleed and fidaxomicin exposure in adult patients, with an observed incidence of 4% in controlled clinical trials. While there are post-marketing reports of adverse reactions, specific details about the GI bleed incidence are not provided, and causality is less clear due to the nature of voluntary reporting. The provided drug label sections do not mention GI bleed as an adverse reaction in pediatric populations or provide case-specific evidence.",NA
gi bleed,flucytosine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for Flucytosine Capsules USP, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which can include gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, is listed as an adverse reaction. This indicates that there has been evidence of GI bleed being associated with the use of flucytosine. Such evidence likely comes from clinical trial observations or post-marketing reports, as these are typically the sources used to compile adverse reaction profiles for drug labels.

The drug label's mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an adverse reaction suggests that cases have been reported in the context of flucytosine treatment. However, specific details such as the incidence rate, severity, or the circumstances under which the GI bleeds occurred (e.g., dosage, duration of treatment, patient demographics, comorbid conditions, or concomitant medications) are not provided in the excerpt. For a comprehensive risk assessment, such details are critical and would ordinarily be found in the full prescribing information, clinical study reports, or published literature.

As precise figures and study references are not included in your text, it is not possible to give a numerical estimate of the risk or a detailed evaluation of the causality based on the provided information. Healthcare professionals typically report suspected adverse reactions to regulatory authorities like the FDA, which can be found in post-marketing surveillance data. Still, this data is not present in the given excerpt.

In conclusion, the evidence of a relationship between GI bleed and flucytosine exposure is supported by its inclusion as an adverse reaction in the drug label for Flucytosine Capsules USP. This indicates that such cases have been observed and reported but does not provide data on the frequency or establish a causal relationship with detailed evidence from clinical trials or observational studies. Further information would be needed to provide a more detailed evaluation.",NA
gi bleed,fludarabine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for fludarabine, there is no specific mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction. However, under section 6.6 (Gastrointestinal System), there is a report of ""hemorrhage"" in the gastrointestinal system being observed, with a frequency of 3% in the MDAH study and 13% in the SWOG study among patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. This indicates that there have been instances of hemorrhagic events in the digestive tract, which could potentially include GI bleeds, in a subset of patients during clinical trials.

It is important to note that the information provided refers to adverse reactions that have actually been observed in clinical trial settings. However, the detailed pathophysiological mechanism linking fludarabine to GI bleeding, if it exists, is not provided in the drug label excerpts. Gastrointestinal bleeding may also occur secondary to other complications such as thrombocytopenia, which is a notably common adverse effect of fludarabine, as seen in over 50% of patients in terms of a decrease in platelet count. Thrombocytopenia could increase the risk of bleeding, including GI bleed, especially when severe.

In terms of the strength of the evidence, the information provided suggests that these observations are based on studies specifically conducted with fludarabine (MDAH and SWOG studies), which adds a level of credibility to the data. Despite this, the provided label sections do not describe in detail any case studies or post-marketing surveillance data that would further clarify the association between GI bleeding and fludarabine use. Post-marketing surveillance is crucial as it can detect adverse reactions that are too rare to be captured in clinical trials or that only become apparent after longer-term use of a drug in the general population.

In summary, while there is some evidence from clinical trials to suggest that gastrointestinal hemorrhage can occur in patients receiving fludarabine, the incidence appears to be relatively low and it is not highlighted as a commonly occurring adverse reaction. Further evidence from post-marketing surveillance or detailed case studies is not provided, and thus, a definitive statement on the causal relationship between fludarabine and gastrointestinal bleeding cannot be made solely based on the provided drug label information. It would be prudent to review additional sources, such as dedicated post-marketing surveillance studies or databases, for a more comprehensive understanding of this potential adverse reaction.",NA
gi bleed,fluoxetine,1.0,"### Summary of Evidence for GI Bleed Association with Fluoxetine

The information provided primarily lists the adverse reactions, warnings, and safety information related to the use of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa, and panic disorder, among other conditions.

**Clinical Trials and Post-Marketing Experience:**

The sections provided do not explicitly mention gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction in the main summary tables for clinical trials. However, GI-related side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, dyspepsia, and dry mouth were reported. Increased risk of bleeding generally is acknowledged in the warnings section (5.7), which states:

- ""Increased Risk of Bleeding: May increase the risk of bleeding. Use with NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation may potentiate the risk of gastrointestinal or other bleeding (5.7).""

In the section discussing postmarketing experience (6.2), various bleeding-related adverse reactions have been reported, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage (which includes GI bleeding). Nonetheless, these are voluntary reports with uncertain frequency and causality since they are after approval use without controlled conditions. Specific types of GI bleeding, such as bloody diarrhea, duodenal ulcer, esophageal ulcer, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematemesis, peptic ulcer, and stomach ulcer hemorrhage, are mentioned under infrequent and rare reactions, suggesting they are not common but have been observed.

**Boxed Warnings and Other Precautions:**

The boxed warnings and other precautions do not specifically address GI bleeding but do warn about the potential for increased bleeding generally and offer guidance on co-administration with other drugs that can affect bleeding risk, such as NSAIDs, aspirin, and anticoagulants.

**Evidence Evaluation:**

Based on the drug label information, it is evident that there is a recognized risk for increased bleeding with fluoxetine use, which is substantiated by data from postmarketing surveillance indicating that bleeding events, including GI bleed, have occurred. These events, although considered rare, are acknowledged in the drug’s labeling. It should be noted that due to the nature of spontaneous reporting, it is challenging to ascertain the exact incidence and establish a robust causal relationship between fluoxetine and GI bleeding.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, while GI bleeding is not listed as a common adverse event in clinical trials for fluoxetine, the potential for increased bleeding risk, including GI bleed, is evidenced in postmarketing reports and is recognized in the warnings section of the drug label. Healthcare professionals are advised to consider this risk when prescribing fluoxetine, especially when used concomitantly with other medications that may exacerbate bleeding risk. 

**Sources:**

- The provided drug label sections for fluoxetine.
- Postmarketing experience reporting systems.
","NA

The provided drug label sections contain information warning about the ""Increased Risk of Bleeding"" associated with the use of fluoxetine (5.7). It specifically states that SSRIs like fluoxetine may increase the risk of bleeding reactions and that gastrointestinal bleeding has been associated with drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake. Although a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is not explicitly listed as a common adverse reaction, the information provided supports a potential relationship between fluoxetine use and bleeding risks, which could include gastrointestinal bleeding. There is no evidence in the provided sections to refute the relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and fluoxetine exposure."
gi bleed,flurbiprofen,1.0,"There is no direct evidence explicitly stated in the provided sections of the drug label that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is an adverse reaction of flurbiprofen when used in its ophthalmic form. The adverse reactions mentioned relate chiefly to ocular effects such as transient burning, stinging, ocular irritation, and other eye-related issues. Increased bleeding tendency is noted, but this is specifically in the context of ocular tissues during surgery, rather than systemic bleeding events such as GI bleed.

Flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and while the drug label information you provided pertains to its ophthalmic use, NSAIDs as a drug class, when taken systemically, are known for their potential to cause GI bleeding. This risk of GI bleed is documented in numerous studies and is a recognized side effect due to the systemic inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes which play a role in protecting the gastric mucosa. However, it is important to differentiate between systemic use and the ophthalmic use of flurbiprofen, as the systemic bioavailability might be significantly lower in ophthalmic preparations, reducing the risk of systemic side effects such as GI bleeding.

Without data from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking ophthalmic flurbiprofen to GI bleeding, it cannot be conclusively stated that this is a known adverse reaction for this particular formulation and use. However, it is important for healthcare providers and patients to be aware of the general risks associated with NSAIDs and to consider individual risk factors (such as a history of ulcers or GI bleeding, concomitant use of anticoagulants, or age), which could predispose a patient to such an event, even if the likelihood is reduced with ophthalmic preparations.

For the most accurate and personalized assessment, healthcare providers should be consulted, and reporting systems like the FDA's MedWatch can be utilized for post-marketing surveillance data to monitor adverse reactions not previously identified in clinical trials.","NA

The adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is not specified in the provided sections of the drug label for flurbiprofen sodium ophthalmic solution, which suggests that there may not be a direct relationship between GI bleeding and the use of this particular formulation of flurbiprofen. The listed adverse reactions primarily relate to ocular effects, which are in line with the expected site of action for an ophthalmic solution. If GI bleeding is not mentioned under adverse reactions or warnings, it is likely that there is no substantial evidence supporting such a relationship with this route of administration. However, it is worth noting that oral forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include systemic formulations of flurbiprofen, are known to be associated with an increased risk of GI bleeding. Hence, the absence of such evidence for the ophthalmic solution may be related to the local rather than systemic use of the medication. It is important to consider the route of administration when assessing the potential adverse reactions of a drug."
gi bleed,fluvoxamine,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for fluvoxamine, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as an infrequent adverse reaction during premarketing clinical trials, specifically noted under the Digestive System subheading. The term ""infrequent"" is used to describe reactions occurring between 1/100 and 1/1000 patients. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage includes conditions such as melena (dark, tarry stools due to bleeding in the stomach or intestines).

The label also cites ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena"" with the designation of ""infrequent,"" and ""hematemesis"" (vomiting of blood) as a rare adverse reaction, which indicates an occurrence in less than 1/1000 patients. This evidence from premarketing clinical trials suggests that there is a potential association between fluvoxamine and gastrointestinal bleeding events, although these events are not among the most common adverse reactions.

No evidence was provided in the sections referenced from the label that specifically addresses ""gi bleed"" as a commonly observed adverse reaction in controlled clinical trials. Furthermore, ""gi bleed"" is not listed under the commonly observed adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials for either adult OCD or depression patients, nor is it listed under the section for postmarketing reports.

Therefore, the available evidence suggesting an association between fluvoxamine and gi bleed, while present, indicates that such events are relatively infrequent when considering the overall population of patients treated with the drug in clinical trials. It is important to note that patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or those taking concomitant medications that increase the risk of bleeding (such as NSAIDs or anticoagulants) may be at a higher risk for gi bleed or other gastrointestinal hemorrhage events. Healthcare providers should monitor patients for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those who are at an increased risk.

Patients and clinicians should report any suspected adverse reactions associated with fluvoxamine use to the appropriate channels, such as the manufacturer ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-308-6755, the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or through the FDA MedWatch website. This can help to accumulate further evidence regarding the safety profile of fluvoxamine and to better understand its adverse effect risks, including potential gi bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,foscarnet,,"The provided drug label sections for foscarnet (FOSCAVIR) detail various adverse reactions associated with its use, primarily focusing on renal impairment, changes in serum electrolytes, seizures, and a wide array of other potential side effects including hematologic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and neurologic adverse events. However, among the documented adverse reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is specifically mentioned under the gastrointestinal system adverse events, citing ""rectal hemorrhage"" and melena, which indicate bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal tract.

In summary, the mention of rectal hemorrhage and melena in the clinical trial data and the label information suggests a potential adverse reaction of GI bleed associated with foscarnet use. While explicit incidence rates or detailed data regarding the direct relationship between foscarnet exposure and general GI bleeding are not provided in the label, these gastrointestinal adverse events are acknowledged within the gathered clinical trial results as well as in post-marketing surveillance reports.

To establish a more precise causal relationship between foscarnet and GI bleeding, the reports from clinical practice would require thorough analysis, considering factors such as the underlying health status of the patient, concurrent medications, and progression of the disease being treated. Moreover, post-marketing surveillance may provide additional real-world evidence on the occurrence and frequency of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to foscarnet.

In medical practice, the evaluation of adverse drug reactions often involves considering the timing of the event relative to drug administration, the known pharmacological properties of the drug, and the reoccurrence of the event upon re-exposure to the drug. Should further clinical or epidemiological studies directly assess the association between foscarnet and GI bleed, they would contribute valuable data to the understanding of this potential adverse reaction. 

As the information stands with the provided drug label, one may infer a possible connection between GI bleed and foscarnet use based on the noted occurrence of rectal hemorrhage and melena but the extent and causality of this relationship would benefit from further dedicated research.","Based on the provided drug label information, there is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (gi bleed) as an adverse reaction to foscarnet (FOSCAVIR). While the label includes a comprehensive list of adverse reactions experienced by patients in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, including renal impairment, alterations in serum electrolytes, seizures, and hematologic abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleeding is not listed among the observed adverse events.

However, it is important to note that the absence of an adverse event in clinical trial data or post-marketing reports does not completely rule out the possibility of its occurrence since not all adverse effects may be detected in clinical trials due to sample size limitations and the specific populations studied. Additionally, post-marketing surveillance may not capture all cases, particularly if the adverse event is rare or not typically associated with the drug.

In summary, based on the available drug label information provided, there is no evidence to suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding is an adverse reaction to foscarnet. If new evidence emerges or post-marketing reports indicate a relationship, this summary would need to be updated accordingly."
gi bleed,fosphenytoin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for fosphenytoin, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction to this medication in the clinical trials experience (Section 6.1), controlled clinical trials data, post-marketing experience (Section 6.2), or the provided warnings and precautions (Section 5).

The reported adverse reactions from the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance primarily focus on events such as hypotension, cardiovascular complications, serious dermatologic reactions, hypersensitivity, hematopoietic complications, and local toxicity, among others. Sensory disturbances like severe burning, itching, and/or paresthesia, as well as hematologic issues such as thrombocytopenia and anemia, are also noted.

GI bleeding is not explicitly stated as a common, infrequent, or rare adverse event in the descriptions of adverse reactions across various patient groups (e.g., adult patients with epilepsy or neurosurgical patients, pediatric patients, and adult epilepsy patients receiving intramuscular administration). Digestive system-related adverse events that are documented include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and tongue disorders, but not GI bleeding.

In the digestive section of the 'Incidence in Clinical Trials' and 'Post-marketing Experience,' some digestive system adverse events are mentioned, like constipation, dyspepsia, diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (which indicates bleeding, but not specifically localized as a GI bleed), and increased salivation. It is important to note that ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" could potentially encompass GI bleed, but it is not specifically named as such.

In summary, there is no clear and direct evidence provided within the drug label sections that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction to fosphenytoin. However, there was a mention of ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" under infrequent digestive adverse events, which may or may not be indicative of GI bleeding episodes related to fosphenytoin use. It is recommended that healthcare professionals report any suspected adverse reactions to drug regulatory bodies like the FDA to contribute to post-marketing surveillance and the better understanding of a drug’s safety profile.","NA

The provided sections from the drug label of fosphenytoin do not mention gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a recognized adverse reaction. There is a mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage under infrequent adverse reactions in the ""Digestive"" system category, but this is not specified as being the same as a GI bleed, and no causal relationship with fosphenytoin is established in this context. The absence of GI bleed as a listed adverse reaction in these sections suggests that there is no substantial evidence directly refuting or supporting GI bleed as a recognized adverse reaction to fosphenytoin. However, it is important to note that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and healthcare professionals should monitor for any adverse events that are not listed on the drug label."
gi bleed,futibatinib,,"Based on the information provided, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, was reported as an adverse reaction in 3.9% of patients treated with LYTGOBI (futibatinib) in clinical trial Study TAS-120-101, as mentioned in section 6.1 of the drug label. This study included 103 patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions or other gene rearrangements. Patients were treated with LYTGOBI 20 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and the median duration of treatment was 9 months.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients receiving LYTGOBI, and GI hemorrhage was among the serious reactions occurring in more than 2% of the patients receiving the treatment. It's worth noting that GI bleeding led to serious adverse events which presumably required medical intervention, though details on the specifics of the management or outcomes are not provided in the summary.

The inclusion of GI bleed as a serious adverse reaction suggests that there is evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleeding and drug exposure to futibatinib based on the observed incidence in this clinical trial setting. However, it is also important to remember that clinical trial conditions vary and the rates observed in this trial might not reflect the rates in clinical practice.

The detail regarding the incidence of GI bleeding was only found specifically in the context of Study TAS-120-101 and was not cited as a general warning or precaution, nor was GI bleeding listed in the commonly reported adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities. Additionally, there was no Boxed Warning associated with GI bleeding for futibatinib.

In conclusion, GI bleed is an identified adverse reaction to futibatinib, as evidenced by its report in 3.9% of patients in a clinical trial setting for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as detailed in the drug label of LYTGOBI. This adverse reaction is serious in nature and could potentially involve significant patient harm.",NA
gi bleed,gabapentin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for gabapentin, there is currently no direct evidence to support a relationship between gi bleed (gastrointestinal bleeding) and gabapentin exposure. The adverse reactions section (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) includes comprehensive details on a wide array of potential side effects identified during clinical trials and post-marketing experience, with common adverse reactions such as dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, and more. In the detailed tables and listings provided, gastrointestinal-related adverse events such as diarrhea, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and vomiting are mentioned, but gi bleed is not cited as a recognized adverse effect in the clinical trials experience or the postmarketing experience of the drug.

Furthermore, the warnings and precautions (5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) do not list gi bleed as a manifested complication of gabapentin use. In the postmarketing experience section (6.2 Postmarketing Experience), various other adverse reactions have been voluntarily reported by patients, indicating a spectrum of reactions not necessarily observed in the clinical trials, yet gi bleed is not one of them.

In summary, the provided sections of the drug label for gabapentin do not indicate gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse reaction to the medication either in the context of the clinical trials data or the postmarketing surveillance. If concerns about potential unlisted adverse reactions like gi bleed arise, it may warrant further investigation or reporting to drug safety authorities for evaluation. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical advice and information about specific medications and their possible side effects.",NA
gi bleed,gabapentin,,"The provided sections of the drug label for gabapentin (marketed as HORIZANT) detail various adverse reactions encountered in clinical trials and post-marketing experience. In these sections, gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea are mentioned (with a 5% incidence in the 600 mg/day group for RLS), but there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding or GI bleed as an adverse reaction in either the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance sections.

Clinically significant adverse reactions described in the warnings and precautions section of the label (section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS) include effects on driving, somnolence/sedation and dizziness, suicidal behavior and ideation, respiratory depression, and DRESS/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea are reported, but there is no specific mention of GI bleeding.

Additionally, in the post-marketing experience (section 6.2), other adverse reactions reported with gabapentin include breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, and bullous pemphigoid, but gastrointestinal bleeding is again not listed.

Therefore, based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no known reported evidence supporting a direct relationship between gabapentin exposure and GI bleeding as an adverse reaction. It is important to note that adverse reactions not observed in the clinical trials or not reported during the post-marketing surveillance may still be possible but have not been confirmed or documented with enough frequency to be included in the drug labeling. Healthcare professionals should report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate drug monitoring authorities to help establish a more comprehensive understanding of a drug's safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,galantamine,,"From the provided sections of the drug label for galantamine, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an observed adverse reaction either in the clinical trial experience or the postmarketing experience. Under the ""Gastrointestinal Conditions"" subheading in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.4), there is a statement that cholinomimetics like galantamine may increase gastric acid secretion and patients should be monitored for symptoms of active or occult GI bleeding, especially those at increased risk such as those with a history of ulcer disease or those using NSAIDs. However, the clinical trials of galantamine did not show an increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.

The most common gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials with a frequency of ≥1% in galantamine-treated patients were nausea (20.7%), vomiting (10.5%), diarrhea (7.4%), and abdominal pain (3.8%). These adverse events are known side effects, but they do not directly indicate GI bleeding. It is worth noting that adverse reactions can vary in severity, and while some patients may experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort, others may face more severe issues.

Given the absence of explicit evidence linking galantamine with GI bleeding in the clinical trial data and postmarketing surveillance presented in the drug label, it is not possible to confirm a relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and the exposure to galantamine. However, healthcare professionals are cautioned to monitor patients on galantamine for signs of GI bleeding, particularly if they have risk factors for this condition.

In the absence of additional data beyond the label, such as case reports or observational studies, we cannot assert that GI bleed is a recognized adverse reaction to galantamine. For a definitive conclusion, further investigation into the literature and case studies would be necessary.

In summary, based on the provided drug label information, there is a precautionary warning regarding monitoring for GI bleeds, but no direct evidence that GI bleed is an established adverse reaction of galantamine. Clinical trial data do not reflect an increased incidence of GI bleeding with galantamine use when compared to placebo.",NA
gi bleed,glatiramer,,"Based on the provided drug label information, there is no evidence supporting a relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the use of glatiramer. Adverse reactions listed in the label are derived from clinical trials, postmarketing experience, and are typically categorized within organ system categories and enumerated by frequency. GI bleed is not mentioned as a common adverse reaction or within the infrequent adverse reactions to glatiramer in the controlled clinical trials or postmarketing experience sections of the label.

The label provides detailed information about various types of adverse reactions, including injection site reactions, systemic reactions (e.g., chest pain, vasodilatation, dyspnea), hematological issues (e.g., lymphadenopathy, leukopenia), and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting). Some adverse reactions, such as hepatic injury, are highlighted with specific warnings and precautions due to their severity and clinical implications. However, it is essential to note that GI bleed is not listed under any of these sections.

Although the digestive system adverse reactions mentioned include esophageal ulcer, gastrointestinal carcinoma, and rectal hemorrhage, these are classified as infrequent, and there is no direct mention or suggestion that GI bleed is a recognized adverse effect of glatiramer.

In conclusion, based on the drug label information, there is no known evidence supporting the association between a potential adverse reaction of GI bleed and drug exposure to glatiramer. Medical professionals and individuals should report any suspected adverse reactions to the relevant authorities, such as Sandoz Inc. or the FDA, as mentioned in the label, to ensure ongoing pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring.","Based on the information provided from clinical trials, postmarketing experience, and the drug label for glatiramer acetate, there is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions detailed include various systemic, injection site, and other specific organ-related events, but GI bleeding is not listed among them.

Therefore, based on the available information from controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, there is no evidence to suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding is an adverse reaction to glatiramer acetate. However, it is important to note that the absence of evidence in the provided sections does not necessarily mean that there is evidence refuting the relationship; it merely indicates that GI bleeding has not been documented or observed in the sources provided. The possibility of an adverse reaction not yet recognized or reported cannot be entirely ruled out. If gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected in a patient taking glatiramer acetate, healthcare providers should consider all potential causes, including other medications or underlying conditions, and report the event for further evaluation."
gi bleed,glipizide,,"The provided drug label sections for glipizide extended-release tablets do not explicitly list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trial settings. However, less than 3% of glipizide-treated patients in clinical trials experienced GI side effects including nausea, vomiting, constipation, and dyspepsia, which suggests that it is uncommon but not completely absent.

Further, postmarketing experience reports have identified cases of gastrointestinal bleeding with the use of another drug using a non-dissolvable extended-release formulation. It is noted that these reports are voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, so it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship between GI bleeding and glipizide exposure solely based on this data.

The information from the drug label suggests that while GI bleeding is not a commonly reported adverse effect of glipizide in clinical trials, there is an acknowledgment of gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding occurring with another drug using a similar extended-release formulation.

Overall, the strength of evidence supporting a direct relationship between GI bleeding and glipizide exposure is not robust based on the provided details. Data from clinical trials have not shown a high incidence of such effects, while postmarketing surveillance indicates gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding with an extended-release formulation similar to glipizide's. However, a firm causal link is not established, implying that GI bleeding is a possible but not clearly substantiated adverse reaction to glipizide.

For conclusive evidence, more targeted pharmacovigilance studies or case reports specifically concerning glipizide and GI bleed would be requisite. Healthcare professionals should consider the possibility of such adverse events and monitor patient symptoms accordingly.","NA

The information provided does not include evidence to refute the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and glipizide exposure. No specific mention of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to glipizide extended-release tablets was found in the provided sections from the drug label, including the clinical trials experience, postmarketing experience, and various warnings, which suggests that GI bleed is not commonly associated or identified as an adverse reaction with this medication. However, reports of gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding were noted with another drug that uses a similar non-dissolvable extended release formulation, but this does not directly implicate glipizide."
gi bleed,glofitamab,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, the evidence does not support a relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the administration of glofitamab (referred to as COLUMVI in the clinical trial Study NP30179). The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities described in the clinical trials experience with glofitamab primarily include cytokine release syndrome, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and fatigue, as well as decreased lymphocyte count, decreased phosphate, decreased neutrophil count, increased uric acid, and decreased fibrinogen.

Gastrointestinal disorders reported include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. However, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is mentioned under ""Clinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in < 10% of patients who received COLUMVI"" without specifying a percentage or establishing a direct relationship to the drug exposure. There is no direct indication in the provided sections that GI bleed is a common or well-documented adverse reaction to glofitamab.

It is critical to note that while a gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed, it is not mentioned as a prominent or frequent adverse event and may have occurred in less than 10% of patients. Since the specific evidence of the incidence rate of GI bleeding associated with glofitamab in clinical trials is not provided, further detail review from the full clinical study reports or peer-reviewed publications would be needed to unequivocally establish the relationship.

Serious infections and tumor flare, other known risks with glofitamab, could potentially lead to secondary complications, such as a GI bleed, but such a relationship is not directly evidenced in the provided text.

For post-marketing surveillance, there are directions to report suspected adverse reactions to appropriate authorities (Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch), which implies that additional evidence beyond clinical trials may exist but is not specified in the provided sections.

In conclusion, there is mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in less than 10% of patients, but no clear and direct evidence is present within the provided text to establish GI bleeding as a significant adverse reaction directly attributable to glofitamab. Further inspection of full reports from clinical trials, case studies, and the post-marketing data would be necessary to provide a more in-depth evaluation of this potential adverse reaction's association with the drug.",NA
gi bleed,goserelin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction in patients treated with goserelin, marketed as ZOLADEX. The detailed sections on adverse reactions from clinical trials, postmarketing experience, and safety warnings indicate a variety of other potential adverse reactions, but GI bleed is not listed among them.

The adverse reactions most commonly listed for men include hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, decreased erections, and lower urinary tract symptoms. For women, the most common adverse reactions are hot flushes, headache, sweating, acne, emotional lability, depression, decreased libido, vaginitis, breast atrophy, seborrhea, and peripheral edema. Tumor flare, which can arise upon the initiation of ZOLADEX treatment, is noted as well. During radiation therapy, some rectal bleeding is reported, which is a type of bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract; however, this is not the same as a generalized 'GI bleed' and is specifically related to radiation treatment. 

The postmarketing experience section mentions adverse reactions such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack that have been observed in some patients, but there is no direct association established with GI bleed.

The sections also describe the possibility of other adverse events such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and injection site injury, as well as special precautions for patients with specific risks. However, GI bleeding does not appear to be a recognized or reported adverse effect of goserelin based on the provided information.

Therefore, in summary, based on the available evidence from these drug label sections, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between GI bleed and goserelin (ZOLADEX) exposure. If further data or other sources were to provide additional information on this topic, it would be necessary to examine those to draw a more informed conclusion.",NA
gi bleed,griseofulvin,0.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and exposure to griseofulvin is limited to rare post-marketing reports. The drug label from Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc., indicates that GI bleeding has been reported infrequently with griseofulvin use. However, it's important to note that reports of such adverse events occurring post-marketing are typically less controlled and less systematic than data gathered from clinical trials. Consequently, these reports do not establish a clear causal link between the drug and the adverse reaction, but they do suggest a potential association that warrants consideration.

There is no mention of GI bleeding as a common adverse effect in the context of clinical trials or systematic studies within the provided label section. The available evidence does not include a quantification of the risk or a clear mechanism by which griseofulvin might induce GI bleeding. Additionally, there is no specific mention of GI bleeding within the provided sections of warnings or box warnings, which tend to highlight more severe or more commonly observed adverse reactions.

In summary, the evidence for GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to griseofulvin is based on rare post-marketing reports, and these occurrences are listed under the adverse reactions section of the drug label. The rarity of these reports suggests that if there is a risk, it is likely to be low. However, given the nature of post-marketing surveillance data, the association should be interpreted with caution. Healthcare providers should be vigilant in monitoring patients on griseofulvin for any signs of GI bleeding, especially since it is classified as a ""rare"" event, and patients should be advised to report any such symptoms immediately.",NA
gi bleed,ibuprofen,1.0,"The drug label for ibuprofen provides evidence that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, specifically gastric or duodenal ulcers with bleeding and/or perforation, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, are recognized as potential adverse reactions to ibuprofen use. These reactions are characterized under the section titled ""ADVERSE REACTIONS"" within the subsection ""Probable Causal Relationship"" at an unknown incidence that is assuredly less than 1%, indicating they are less frequent than some other adverse effects but still have a probable link to ibuprofen consumption based on clinical evidence and/or postmarketing reports.

Further support for the relationship between GI bleeding and ibuprofen comes from the ""Gastrointestinal Risk"" statement included under ""WARNINGS"" in the drug label. The label specifies that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the class of drugs to which ibuprofen belongs, carry an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. It is mentioned that these events can be fatal and might occur at any time during the use of the drug, often without prior warning symptoms. Additionally, it notes that elderly patients are at higher risk for serious GI events.

While the exact incidence is not provided for GI bleeds specifically connected to ibuprofen, the classification within the drug label still reflects an evidence-based acknowledgement of their occurrence. This assessment is likely derived from multiple sources including controlled clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance which inform the drug’s label information as mandated by health authorities.

The evidence from the drug label suggests that while GI bleed as an adverse reaction to ibuprofen is not among the most common side effects, it occurs with enough frequency and severity to merit explicit warnings and it has been substantiated to a degree that suggests a probable causal relationship. This is indicative of a considered review of available medical and scientific evidence as per regulatory standards.","NA

The drug label clearly states ""gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal"" as a risk associated with the use of ibuprofen. The label also lists ""gastric or duodenal ulcer with bleeding and/or perforation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" as adverse reactions that have a probable causal relationship with ibuprofen use. Therefore, there is evidence indicating that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is, indeed, an adverse reaction related to ibuprofen use, and no evidence refuting this relationship is provided within the provided drug label sections."
gi bleed,ifosfamide,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ifosfamide, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, appears to be a potential adverse reaction associated with the drug. Here is a summary of the evidence related to GI bleed as an adverse reaction to ifosfamide:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
The adverse reactions list from clinical trials includes thrombocytopenia, which is stated to be complicated by bleeding and has been associated with a bleeding risk with a fatal outcome in some cases (any thrombocytopenia, 50 x 10^3/µL - 4.8% or 35/729). Thrombocytopenia can lead to an increased risk of bleeding, including GI bleed. However, specific information related to the incidence of GI bleed in clinical trials has not been provided explicitly within the text.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Post-marketing experience with ifosfamide, which captures adverse reactions reported after the drug has been approved for use, has identified gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an adverse reaction. Because post-marketing reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, the frequency of such reactions cannot be precisely estimated, nor can causality be established based solely on these reports.

The mention of ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section of the label indicates that instances of GI bleed have been observed following the use of ifosfamide after it was made available to the general patient population. However, the wording suggests that while there is an association, a direct causal relationship has not been definitively established due to the nature of post-marketing reporting.

It is important to note that the presence of such an adverse reaction in the post-marketing data suggests that healthcare providers should be vigilant for the signs of a GI bleed in patients receiving ifosfamide, but there is no specific percentage risk provided for this reaction.

In summary, there is no clear evidence from the clinical trials section of the label that directly associates GI bleed with ifosfamide use. However, thrombocytopenia, a known cause of bleeding, is listed, and there is an implication of bleeding events, including GI bleed, through the post-marketing experience data. Therefore, the evidence of a GI bleed as an adverse effect is derived from post-marketing surveillance rather than controlled clinical trial conditions.",NA
gi bleed,imatinib,,"The relationship between imatinib and the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can be assessed by examining the relevant sections of the drug label provided. 

Clinical Trials Experience: GI hemorrhage is explicitly listed as an adverse reaction in the tables summarizing results from clinical trials. For instance, in Table 2 of the provided document, GI hemorrhage was reported in 1.6% of patients treated with imatinib for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) compared to 1.1% in the interferon-alpha plus cytarabine (IFN+Ara-C) treatment group. Similarly, Table 4 shows that GI hemorrhage occurred in 4% of patients in the myeloid blast crisis CML trial, again indicating a relationship between imatinib use and the incidence of GI bleed.

Warnings and Precautions: Section 5.5 mentions that Grade 3/4 hemorrhage has been reported in clinical studies for patients with newly diagnosed CML and with GIST, indicating that significant bleeding events are a known risk associated with imatinib treatment. It is further specified that GI tumor sites may be the source of GI bleeds in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

Postmarketing Experience: GI perforations, which can be severe and are sometimes fatal, have been reported (Section 6.2). Although not explicitly stated as GI bleeding, perforations can be associated with serious hemorrhagic complications.

Summary:
The drug label for imatinib includes evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential adverse reaction based on clinical trial data, postmarketing experience, and safety warnings. The incidence, while relatively low, is supported by comparative data with control treatments, and specific instances of GI hemorrhage or related events are documented. Clinicians should be aware of this risk, appropriately monitor patients for signs of bleeding, and manage as per clinical guidelines.",NA
gi bleed,indomethacin,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, including ulceration and perforation, and the exposure to indomethacin, an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), can be summarized from the drug label sections provided as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- In a gastroscopic study of 45 healthy subjects, the incidence of gastric mucosal abnormalities was significantly higher in the group receiving indomethacin capsules compared to those taking indomethacin suppositories or placebo.
- A double-blind comparative clinical study involving 175 patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed that the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse effects was comparable between indomethacin capsules and suppositories. However, the incidence of lower gastrointestinal adverse effects was greater in the suppository group.

Adverse Reactions Evidence:
- The adverse reactions listed under section 6 of the drug label include GI-related events such as nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and constipation as common occurrences.
- Less frequent but more severe reactions involve peptic ulcer, gastroenteritis, rectal bleeding, and more serious events like ulcerations, perforation, and hemorrhage of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or intestines.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- While specific post-marketing surveillance details are not provided in the given text, the document urges reporting suspected adverse reactions to the FDA, indicating an ongoing surveillance effort.

Warnings and Precautions:
- GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation: The drug label clearly states that NSAIDs like indomethacin can cause serious GI adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, potentially leading to fatalities. These events can occur at any time during use without warning, and elderly patients or those with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk.

Boxed Warnings:
- Serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events are included in the boxed warnings, emphasizing that indomethacin can increase the risk of serious GI adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, which can be fatal and may occur at any time during use without warning symptoms.

The evidence from clinical trials, adverse reaction data, and explicit warnings all support the association between GI bleeding and indomethacin use. The consistent mention of gastrointestinal risks across different sections of the drug label highlights the significance of the potential adverse reaction and the importance of monitoring patients accordingly.",NA
gi bleed,inotuzumab ozogamicin,,"To summarize the evidence supporting the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in association with inotuzumab ozogamicin exposure, we should consider the details provided in the drug label sections, specifically regarding adverse reactions and warnings.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin, marketed as BESPONSA, is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). According to the clinical trials experience detailed in section 6.1, the most common adverse reactions (≥20%) observed include thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, infections, anemia, leukopenia, fatigue, hemorrhage, pyrexia, nausea, headache, febrile neutropenia, transaminases increased, abdominal pain, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, and hyperbilirubinemia.

In the context of hemorrhage as an adverse reaction, the data show that hemorrhagic events were reported in 33% of patients who received BESPONSA. Within these events, various types of bleeding were enumerated, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 

Specifically, the following relevant preferred terms were listed under hemorrhage events, which include GI bleeding:
- Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
- Hematemesis (vomiting blood)
- Hematochezia (passing fresh blood through the anus)
- Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage
- Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage
These terms directly represent different manifestations of GI bleeding, supporting that GI bleed is indeed an adverse reaction observed during treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin.

Furthermore, the warnings and precautions section (5.3) describes that bleeding/hemorrhagic events were observed and may require specific interventions such as dosing interruption, dose reduction, or permanent discontinuation of BESPONSA.

It is pivotal to highlight that while these data provide evidence of GI bleeding occurrences in clinical trials of inotuzumab ozogamicin, the rates of these adverse events compared to control are not provided in the summary, which would be necessary for a more detailed risk assessment.

Based on the clinical trial data cited in the drug labeling material provided, GI bleeding is a documented adverse reaction of inotuzumab ozogamicin. No specific mention of case studies or post-marketing surveillance data related to GI bleeding with inotuzumab ozogamicin was provided in the summary; however, the clinical trials experience clearly indicates GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to this medication.",NA
gi bleed,isopropyl alcohol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence suggesting a relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the use of isopropyl alcohol. The sections shared primarily focus on the safety, adverse reactions, immunogenicity, and warnings associated with the drug adalimumab, marketed under the brand name ABRILADA, among other indications. Isopropyl alcohol is not mentioned in the provided sections relating to ABRILADA.

Regarding adalimumab, a variety of adverse reactions and potential risks are detailed, including serious infections, malignancies, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatitis B virus reactivation, neurological reactions, hematological reactions, and others. Some of the adverse gastrointestinal effects noted in the label, such as abdominal pain and nausea, do not include GI bleeding as a reported adverse reaction. Additionally, the boxed warnings and specific warnings and precautions sections of the label caution against the use of adalimumab in certain conditions and detail the observed increased risks of serious infections and malignancy.

However, no section relates to the potential adverse reaction of GI bleeding from exposure to isopropyl alcohol. It is important to clarify that isopropyl alcohol is generally not intended for ingestion and is typically used for external disinfection, such as in the preparation of injection sites. Ingesting isopropyl alcohol can be toxic and potentially cause GI irritation and bleeding, among other serious health effects. Such information would not normally be found in a medication label unless isopropyl alcohol was a component of the formulation, which does not appear to be the case with ABRILADA.

If you are seeking information specifically about isopropyl alcohol and its potential to cause a GI bleed, it would be necessary to consult sources that specialize in toxicology or poison control rather than a drug label for a specific therapeutic medication. In conclusion, there is no known evidence in the provided drug label that establishes gi bleed as an adverse reaction to isopropyl alcohol.",NA
gi bleed,ixabepilone,,"Based on the provided drug label information for ixabepilone, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an observed adverse reaction from either clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The label provides extensive detail on other adverse reactions observed and reported during clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance for ixabepilone, which includes peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac adverse reactions, and others.

The most common listed adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) do not include GI bleeding. Similarly, hematologic abnormalities reported were primarily focused on neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, without mention of GI bleeding.

When examining the gastrointestinal disorders section from the clinical trials (Study 046 and Study 081), various adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain were documented, but again GI bleeding is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the postmarketing experience section references only one non-specific adverse reaction without quantitative frequency or causal relationship data, and does not mention GI bleeding.

With the data provided and absent explicit evidence of GI bleeding associated with ixabepilone from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance within the drug label, it can be concluded that there is no known evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction and exposure to ixabepilone as of the knowledge cut-off date. 

Any consideration of GI bleeding as a potential adverse event would require further investigation or reports in medical literature beyond the provided label, which are not referenced in this summary. Health care providers are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate monitoring systems to help establish a more comprehensive safety profile for the drug.",NA
gi bleed,ketoprofen,1.0,"Evidence Summary:

The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and ketoprofen exposure is supported by information sourced from controlled clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, as outlined in the drug label sections provided.

Controlled Clinical Trials:
- In controlled clinical trials that lasted from 4 to 54 weeks involving 835 patients treated with ketoprofen, and trials lasting from 4 to 16 weeks involving 622 patients treated with ketoprofen extended-release capsules, peptic ulcer or GI bleeding occurred in less than 1% of 1,076 patients.
- A comparison in 321 arthritis patients showed no significant difference in upper or lower GI symptoms between those treated with 200 mg of ketoprofen extended-release capsules once daily or 75 mg of ketoprofen immediate-release capsules three times a day (255 mg/day).

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
- In open-label continuation studies with 1,292 patients, the incidence of peptic ulcer or GI bleeding was greater than 2%.
- The label indicates that the incidence of peptic ulceration in patients on NSAIDs like ketoprofen is influenced by factors such as age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, diet, stress, concurrent medications (e.g., aspirin and corticosteroids), and the dose and duration of NSAID treatment.
- The drug label also acknowledges an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use, without warning symptoms, with the elderly at greater risk.

Box Warnings:
- The box warnings highlight that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ketoprofen, may lead to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.

Conclusion:
The evidence to support the relationship between GI bleed and ketoprofen use is derived from controlled clinical trials and post-marketing experiences. While less than 1% of patients in controlled trials experienced GI bleeding, post-marketing data suggest a higher occurrence rate (more than 2% in open-label studies). Additionally, the drug's labeling emphasizes that NSAIDs as a class are associated with an elevated risk of GI adverse events, including bleeding. These risks are recognized in the provided sections of the drug label, indicating awareness from both clinical study results and real-world usage. This supports the causal relationship between ketoprofen exposure and the potential adverse reaction of GI bleeding.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections for ketoprofen, there is evidence that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a potential adverse reaction, although it occurs at a low incidence. In controlled clinical trials, peptic ulcer or GI bleeding occurred in less than 1% of 1,076 patients; however, continuation studies showed a rate greater than 2%. The label also mentions that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include ketoprofen, carry an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding. Thus, no evidence refutes the relationship between GI bleed and ketoprofen exposure; instead, the evidence supports this relationship."
gi bleed,ketorolac,1.0,"The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and drug exposure to ketorolac tromethamine is well-documented and supported by evidence from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance. Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a known risk for causing peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be serious and potentially fatal. 

The summarized evidence includes:

**Clinical Trials:** In clinical trials, GI adverse experiences occurred in approximately 1% to 10% of patients taking ketorolac. These experiences ranged from abdominal pain and dyspepsia to more serious outcomes such as GI ulcers and gross bleeding/perforation. An increased rate of adverse reactions, including GI issues, is associated with higher doses of the drug.

**Case Studies:** While case studies are not specifically listed, individual cases of adverse reactions are often reported to medical journals and contribute to the body of evidence regarding drug safety.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:** A large nonrandomized postmarketing observational study involving approximately 10,000 patients demonstrated a dose-dependent risk of clinically serious GI bleeding with ketorolac tromethamine usage. The incidence of GI bleeding after up to 5 days of treatment was higher in elderly patients and in those with higher daily dosages, notably exceeding the 60 mg/day threshold.

**Label Information:** According to the label of ketorolac tromethamine:
- Ketorolac tromethamine can cause peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation, and these events can occur at any time, often without warning.
- Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious GI events.
- The drug is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, recent GI bleeding or perforation, and those with a history of peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding.
- Ketorolac tromethamine should not exceed a total combined use of 5 days and is contraindicated for managing minor or chronic pain conditions.
- Increased dosing beyond the daily maximum increases the risk of serious adverse events without providing additional efficacy.

**Boxed Warning:** The boxed warning, which highlights the potential for severe complications, includes the risk of GI ulceration, bleeding, and perforation as a consequence of ketorolac treatment.

In conclusion, there is clear evidence from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the drug's label information supporting the relationship between GI bleeding and the use of ketorolac tromethamine. This risk is dose-dependent and particularly significant in elderly patients and those with a history of PUB (peptic ulcer disease, ulceration, or bleeding).","NA

The drug label provided indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction to ketorolac tromethamine. According to the label, GI bleeding, as well as GI ulceration and perforation, are serious complications of treatment with ketorolac tromethamine. The postmarketing surveillance study cited in the drug label further demonstrates a dose-dependent risk of clinically serious GI bleeding, particularly in elderly patients and those with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Given this information, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and ketorolac; on the contrary, the relationship is well established."
gi bleed,lamotrigine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for lamotrigine, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common or serious adverse reaction associated with the use of lamotrigine. 

The adverse reactions listed include common events such as dizziness, headache, diplopia, ataxia, nausea, and rash among others. Serious skin rashes like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been highlighted as potential serious adverse reactions.

The Warnings and Precautions section notes the presence of certain specific reactions like hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities, and blood dyscrasias, but again, there is no explicit mention of GI bleed.

However, under the ""Digestive System"" sub-section of the ""Other Adverse Reactions Observed in All Clinical Trials"" part, there is a mention of infrequent digestive system adverse reactions including dysphagia, eructation, gastritis, and increased salivation, and rare reactions including gastrointestinal hemorrhage and rectal hemorrhage. GI bleed could potentially fall under these categories, but no gradient of frequency is provided specific to GI bleeding. Additionally, rectal hemorrhage and peptic ulcer are listed as adverse reactions occurring with a frequency of less than 5% and more than 2% of patients receiving lamotrigine and numerically more frequent than placebo, indicating some evidence of GI tract-related adverse events during clinical trials.

The Postmarketing Experience section does not expressly mention GI bleed either, suggesting that if such events have been reported, they are not among the highlighted postmarketing adverse reactions.

In conclusion, there is no direct and specific evidence within the provided drug label that establishes a strong and clinically significant relationship between lamotrigine use and gastrointestinal bleeding as a common adverse event. There is mention of ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" and ""rectal hemorrhage"" as rare adverse reactions, which indicates potential instances of GI bleed, but clear, quantifiable evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specific to GI bleed as an adverse reaction to lamotrigine is not detailed in the provided label sections. Therefore, while GI bleed might be a possible adverse event as per rare reports, it is not characterized as a prominent or common adverse reaction related to lamotrigine in the provided material.",NA
gi bleed,lansoprazole,,"Regarding the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the use of lansoprazole, a review of the provided drug label information from the adverse reactions and warnings sections does not explicitly mention GI bleed as a reported adverse reaction. However, it does list gastrointestinal hemorrhage under digestive system reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients in domestic trials (Section 6.1 Additional adverse experiences). It is important to note that gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a broader term that can encompass various forms of bleeding, including GI bleed.

Additionally, the label mentions other gastrointestinal-related issues such as gastric ulcers and esophageal ulcer, which can potentially be associated with bleeding. It is known from clinical practice that GI bleeds can occur in the context of ulcerative diseases, although the causal relationship with lansoprazole specifically is not detailed in the summary provided.

Post-marketing experience data include a wide range of adverse effects reported voluntarily, and among them are conditions related to the digestive system such as gastritis and esophagitis. While these can be associated with bleeding, there is no specific mention of a link between lansoprazole and an increased risk of GI bleed in this context either (Section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience).

In conclusion, while the information provided does not offer direct evidence or a specified frequency regarding GI bleed as an adverse reaction to lansopazole, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and conditions which can lead to such a reaction are present in less than 1% of patients based on domestic trials. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for GI related adverse events and monitor patients accordingly, especially since the link between PPI therapy and GI bleed is recognized in clinical medicine outside of this specific label information. For a more definitive assessment, additional information such as peer-reviewed studies, case reports, and a more detailed analysis of post-marketing surveillance data would be required.","NA

The provided drug label sections for lansoprazole do not list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a reported adverse reaction or warning. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation. GI bleeding is not mentioned among the clinical trials experience or the postmarketing experience. Furthermore, no warnings or box warnings specific to GI bleed are listed in the label excerpts provided. Therefore, based on the information available, there is no evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and lansoprazole because GI bleed is not recognized as an adverse reaction of lansoprazole in the first place."
gi bleed,lenalidomide,,"The provided drug label sections for lenalidomide do not specifically list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction. However, they do describe various adverse reactions and warnings that are relevant to lenalidomide use.

Clinical Trials: According to the clinical trial data presented for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the most common adverse reactions related to the gastrointestinal system included diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea. There was no specific mention of GI bleed in the clinical trials experience section for lenalidomide. 

Warnings and Precautions: No explicit warning about GI bleed is issued within the boxed warnings, which primarily focus on the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity, hematologic toxicity, and venous and arterial thromboembolism. In the general warnings and precautions, hepatotoxicity is mentioned, but this refers to liver-related toxicities and does not directly address GI bleeding.

Postmarketing Experience: While the postmarketing experience section does mention gastrointestinal hemorrhage among other serious adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to study drug treatment) in different clinical studies of lenalidomide, it is not possible to establish a direct relationship or frequency of GI bleed as an adverse reaction solely from this postmarketing data.

Overall, the evidence from the provided sections of the drug label does not explicitly support a relationship between lenalidomide and GI bleed. However, it is important to note that gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed in the postmarketing experience section without clear attribution to lenalidomide. Additionally, due to the complexity and variety of patients' conditions and concomitant medications, the potential for a GI bleed as an adverse event may not be entirely excluded and healthcare providers should consider the overall clinical picture when prescribing lenalidomide.

Sources of Evidence:
- Drug label sections for lenalidomide provided in the question, encompassing adverse reactions, warnings and precautions, and postmarketing experience.
- Clinical trials data for NDMM and MDS.
- Postmarketing surveillance data.

It is recommended to consult the full prescribing information, further clinical data, and postmarketing reports for a comprehensive understanding of all potential adverse events associated with lenalidomide. Clinicians should monitor patients for any signs of gastrointestinal distress and manage them according to best clinical practices.",NA
gi bleed,leuprolide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ELIGARD (leuprolide acetate), which is used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a reported adverse reaction resulting from the clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing experience for this medication.

The adverse reactions reported most commonly in clinical trials (with an incidence ≥ 5%) included malaise, fatigue, hot flashes/sweats, and testicular atrophy. Other adverse reactions cited in clinical trials and post-marketing experience included systemic effects such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and convulsions, among others. However, gastrointestinal bleeding is not listed among these observed adverse reactions.

While adverse reactions involving the gastrointestinal system like nausea and gastroenteritis/colitis are mentioned, these do not specifically relate to GI bleed. Furthermore, there is no mention of GI bleed in the warnings and precautions section.

In conclusion, there is no evidence from the clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance within the drug label provided to suggest a relationship between GI bleed and leuprolide acetate exposure. If additional data from other sources outside of this label exist that specifically suggest such an association, they are not included here and would need to be evaluated to make a comprehensive assessment.",NA
gi bleed,linezolid,,"Based on the provided label information for linezolid, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions reported in more than 5% of adult and pediatric patients include diarrhea, vomiting, headache, nausea, and anemia, but GI bleeding is not specifically listed.

From the clinical trials experience, no evidence directly links linezolid with GI bleeding. The trials mention various treatment-emergent adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anemia, which could potentially be related to or a predisposition to GI bleeding, but no direct association is made.

Postmarketing experience has reported cases of myelosuppression, including thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia, or reduced platelet counts, can increase the risk of bleeding, including GI bleeding. However, the label does not explicitly state that GI bleeding events have been observed postmarketing.

A warning is provided regarding myelosuppression, which includes monitoring complete blood counts weekly, especially in patients with risk factors such as pre-existing myelosuppression, severe renal or moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and those receiving concomitant drugs that produce bone marrow suppression. Patients with thrombocytopenia have been noted in the compassionate use program, and bleeding events have been identified, although the direct role of linezolid in these events is not clearly established.

In summary, while thrombocytopenia, which could predispose to GI bleeding, has been reported in association with linezolid use, there is no clear, direct evidence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data available in the drug's label information. Caution is advised for potential bleeding risks, especially in patients with factors that could increase this risk.","NA

The evidence provided in the drug label does not refute the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and linezolid exposure. The label does not list GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction (>5%) or even as a treatment-emergent adverse reaction occurring in more than 1% of treated patients. Additionally, there is no mention of GI bleed in the provided sections related to postmarketing experience, clinical trials, or laboratory abnormalities. 

It is important to note that the absence of GI bleed as a documented adverse reaction in this drug label does not conclusively establish that GI bleed is not related to linezolid—only that it was not identified as a significant adverse event in the clinical trial data or reported sufficiently in postmarketing surveillance to warrant inclusion in the sections provided."
gi bleed,lorazepam,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections for adverse reactions and warnings, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction to lorazepam. The adverse reactions listed are mostly related to the central nervous system (such as sedation, dizziness, and unsteadiness) and other systemic effects (like respiratory depression and various psychiatric conditions), but GI bleed is not specified.

It is important to acknowledge that while the drug label represents a formal and comprehensive consolidation of known adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and other scientific sources, it may not capture every possible side effect. Drug labels typically reflect more common and well-substantiated adverse effects; less frequent or less clearly associated side effects might not be included.

In the absence of GI bleed on the drug label, we can infer that there wasn't significant evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance that directly linked lorazepam to GI bleed up to the time of my knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, it should be noted that adverse reactions can sometimes be idiosyncratic, and there could be rare cases or emerging evidence that were not captured on the label or that have appeared in the literature since the last update.

In conclusion, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence supporting a direct relationship between the exposure to lorazepam and the occurrence of GI bleed. Should concerns about a potential adverse reaction arise, health care professionals are encouraged to report these incidents to the FDA or relevant authorities for further investigation and monitoring.",NA
gi bleed,maralixibat,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for maralixibat (LIVMARLI), gastrointestinal bleeding (which includes gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematemesis, hematochezia, and melena) is listed as one of the adverse reactions experienced by patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) who were treated with the drug. Within the clinical trials component of the Alagille syndrome development program, which consisted of five clinical studies with 86 patients, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 9 (10.4%) patients, with an exposure-adjusted incidence rate of 3.8 events per 100 person-years. This relationship is supported by the observed clinical trial data, as stated in the label's subsection 6.1 'Clinical Trials Experience'.

The drug label also provides warnings and precautions in subsection 5.2 'Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions', which advises consideration of dose interruption or treatment discontinuation for persistent gastrointestinal symptoms including gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if no other etiologies are found.

The adverse reaction reporting provided by the label indicates a known association between maralixibat and gastrointestinal bleeding in patients. There is no specific mention of 'GI bleed' as a term itself, but it is commonly understood that GI bleed encompasses the events described under gastrointestinal bleeding. No specific case studies or post-marketing surveillance data were provided in the drug label excerpts, so it is not possible to comment on those sources of evidence in this summary.

In conclusion, the evidence coming from clinical trials as detailed in the drug label demonstrates that gastrointestinal bleeding is an adverse reaction associated with maralixibat use in patients with Alagille syndrome. It is important to monitor patients for this potential adverse occurrence and manage according to the guidance provided in the drug label.",NA
gi bleed,mefenamate,1.0,"Based on the drug label sections provided, there is evidence to support the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and mefenamic acid exposure, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The evidence can be summarized as follows:

Clinical Trials Experience:
- GI bleeding is recognized as an adverse effect of mefenamic acid. The clinical trials mentioned within the label acknowledge that adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal experiences—including abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), and vomiting—occurred in approximately 1 to 10% of patients taking mefenamic acid or other NSAIDs.
- However, due to the nature of clinical trials being conducted under widely varying conditions, direct comparison of adverse reaction rates with other drugs is cautioned against.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- Additional gastrointestinal-related adverse experiences such as digestive system issues that include dry mouth, esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, glossitis, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and rectal bleeding have been reported occasionally and are listed in the adverse reactions section of the label.

Warnings:
- The drug label contains serious warnings about the risk of GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation associated with the use of NSAIDs like mefenamic acid. These serious adverse events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms.
- The risk of serious GI adverse events is heightened in elderly patients and those with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding.

In conclusion, the evidence from the drug label, which encompasses data from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, indicates that there is a significant adverse reaction relationship between mefenamic acid use and the potential for GI bleeding. The warnings section of the label further emphasizes the seriousness of this risk, highlighting that these events can be fatal and that certain populations are at higher risk. This summary confirms that GI bleed is recognized as an adverse reaction of mefenamic acid.",NA
gi bleed,meloxicam,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction and the use of meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), comes from clinical trial findings, post-marketing surveillance, and specific warnings outlined by regulatory authorities.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
1. The meloxicam clinical trial database, which included Phase 2/3 trials, enrolled 10,122 osteoarthritis (OA) patients and 1,012 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with 7.5 mg/day of meloxicam, and 3,505 OA patients and 1,351 RA patients treated with 15 mg/day. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were the most frequently reported across all meloxicam treatment groups in these trials.

2. The adverse events table for a 12-week osteoarthritis placebo- and active-controlled trial showed an incidence of gastrointestinal disorders of 17.2%, 20.1%, and 17.3% in placebo, meloxicam 7.5 mg, and meloxicam 15 mg groups respectively, while in rheumatoid arthritis placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal disorders occurred in 14.1%, 18.9%, and 16.8% respectively.

3. More serious gastrointestinal adverse events like gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic gastric ulcer, and intestinal perforation were listed under adverse reactions occurring in less than 2% of patients in clinical trials.

**Post-marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
The adverse events identified during post-approval use of meloxicam, which are voluntarily reported and thus difficult to accurately estimate in frequency, included severe GI events such as gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration.

**Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions:**
1. The Boxed Warning for meloxicam highlights the increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines that can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use, without warning symptoms, with elderly patients and those with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding at greater risk.

2. The Warnings and Precautions section specifies that serious GI bleeding can occur with meloxicam use, with strategies to minimize the risk outlined. It also indicates that even short-term NSAID therapy is not free of risk and reports the percentages of patients who could develop upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation over different treatment durations.

In summary, there is substantial evidence from clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance, and regulatory warnings that GI bleeding is a potential adverse reaction from the use of meloxicam. This relationship is particularly emphasized by the Boxed Warning, which is the strongest warning the FDA requires, indicating that the risk is significant enough to potentially outweigh the benefits in high-risk populations.","NA

The provided drug label sections from the meloxicam prescribing information explicitly list gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation as potential serious adverse events related to the drug (see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions, section 5.2). There is no evidence provided that refutes GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction of meloxicam."
gi bleed,memantine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for memantine, a medication used to manage symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (with an incidence of ≥5% and greater than placebo) include dizziness, headache, confusion, and constipation. Additionally, the label lists other adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in patients treated with memantine and at a frequency greater than that observed in placebo-treated patients. These span various system organ classes, such as gastrointestinal (constipation, vomiting), cardiovascular (hypertension), central and peripheral nervous system (dizziness, headache), among others.

However, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is not explicitly mentioned in either the sections about adverse reactions from clinical trials or post-marketing experience. While constipation and vomiting are reported gastrointestinal side effects, the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding in the provided information suggests that, based on clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance up to the point of the knowledge cutoff, there is no known direct evidence supporting a relationship between memantine and GI bleed as an adverse reaction.

The post-marketing experience section lists adverse reactions identified during the drug's use after approval, which includes a broader range of potential side effects due to more extensive exposure in the general population. Despite this, GI bleed is not listed, indicating that if such cases have occurred, they either have not been reported in a manner that establishes a causal relationship with memantine use or are not frequent enough to be noted in the label.

In conclusion, there is no evidence presented in the provided drug label sections to support a relationship between GI bleed and memantine exposure based on the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance cited. If GI bleed were a notable adverse reaction of memantine, it would be reasonable to expect it to be included, especially under post-marketing surveillance where less common side effects might emerge. Therefore, without additional data or case reports suggesting such a relationship, the evidence does not support GI bleed as an adverse reaction linked to memantine.",NA
gi bleed,meropenem,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (which includes gastrointestinal bleeds or GI bleeds) is a reported adverse reaction associated with the use of meropenem. In the clinical trial data summarized within the label, gastrointestinal hemorrhage was observed in 0.5% of the patients. It is important to note that these rates come from controlled clinical study environments, and while the association between meropenem and GI bleed has been reported, the overall incidence is relatively low.

The patients in these trials often had several underlying medical conditions and were simultaneously on multiple drug therapies, which makes it challenging to definitively attribute the adverse events solely to the use of meropenem. Additionally, for seriously ill patients, establishing a causal relationship between the incidences of adverse events and meropenem therapy can be difficult.

Other bleeding events were also reported, with the frequencies being melena (0.3%), epistaxis (0.2%), and hemoperitoneum (0.2%). In the context of these bleeding events, GI bleed is a recognized but infrequent adverse reaction, which clinicians should be aware of when prescribing meropenem.

There are no box warnings in the label sections provided that specifically mention GI bleed as an adverse effect. The information reported also does not indicate a distinct mechanism by which meropenem could lead to GI bleed; such reactions could be multifactorial in patients with complex medical backgrounds.

In the postmarketing experience for meropenem, there is no additional mention of GI bleed beyond the clinical trials data in the provided sections, meaning no new safety concerns regarding GI bleed have been identified after the drug's approval that were significant enough to be included in the label.

Clinicians should continue to monitor patients for any signs of adverse reactions, including GI bleed, during meropenem therapy and report such events to pharmacovigilance systems to ensure ongoing evaluation of the drug's safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,mesalamine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing experience, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction associated with the use of mesalamine. The listed adverse reactions include various gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain/cramps/discomfort, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and rectal pain, but not GI bleeding.

It is important to note that while GI bleeding is not listed within the label's outlined adverse reactions, it does not definitively rule out such an occurrence, particularly because mesalamine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, which themselves can cause GI bleeding. Adverse events not reported in clinical trials might still occur and be identified through post-marketing surveillance or case studies. However, based on the information provided and without access to additional literature or databases outside the label, GI bleed does not appear to be a well-established or commonly reported adverse effect specifically attributed to mesalamine treatment.

If there were other cases reported in the literature or through post-marketing surveillance connecting mesalamine use with GI bleeding, those would need to be examined to establish a potential causal relationship. Such evaluation would include reviewing the frequency of reports, the presence of confounding factors, the plausibility of the mechanism of action causing GI bleeding, and temporal association between drug exposure and the adverse event.

In conclusion, according to the available information from the drug label, there is no evidence that directly supports GI bleeding as a commonly reported adverse reaction of mesalamine. However, healthcare professionals should remain vigilant for this potential adverse event, considering the background risk in the patient population receiving this medication.",NA
gi bleed,methotrexate,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and methotrexate exposure is outlined in the drug label sections provided. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug that can cause a range of adverse reactions due to its mechanism of action, which includes interfering with the metabolism of folic acid.

Gastrointestinal toxicity is a recognized adverse reaction to methotrexate, as stated in the *Warnings and Precautions (5.4)* section of the label. It mentions that adverse reactions such as diarrhea, vomiting, and stomatitis can occur. The label specifically states that ""hemorrhagic enteritis and fatal intestinal perforation have been reported."" Hemorrhagic enteritis involves inflammation of the intestine accompanied by bleeding, which constitutes evidence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to methotrexate.

Additionally, in the *Postmarketing Experience (6.2)* section of the label, gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as ""hematemesis, melena, and gastrointestinal ulceration"" have been identified during the postapproval use of methotrexate. Hematemesis refers to vomiting blood, and melena is the passage of dark, tarry stools due to the presence of digested blood. These findings align with GI bleeding.

As post-marketing surveillance gathers data on drug safety from a broader and more diverse patient population than clinical trials, the reporting of GI bleeding in this context reinforces the evidence that GI bleed can be an adverse reaction of methotrexate.

There is no specific mention of a GI bleed being a result of methotrexate exposure in controlled clinical trials as provided. However, gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and abdominal distress were common adverse reactions in trials for rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) patients, as outlined in the *Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)* section.

In summary, the labeling indicates that gastrointestinal toxicity, including severe conditions that can result in GI bleeding, is an adverse reaction associated with methotrexate use. This evidence is supported by reported clinical observations and findings from post-marketing surveillance rather than from specific outcomes of controlled clinical trials. It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of these risks and to monitor and advise patients accordingly.","NA

The provided drug label information indicates that gastrointestinal toxicity is a known adverse reaction of methotrexate, including ""gastrointestinal ulceration"" and ""hemorrhagic enteritis"" as found in the postmarketing experience section (6.2). These conditions can be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, which may present as a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Therefore, there is evidence to support the relationship between methotrexate and the potential adverse reaction of a GI bleed. Refuting this relationship is not supported by the provided label information."
gi bleed,midostaurin,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and midostaurin exposure predominantly comes from clinical trial data for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM), as seen in the drug label provided. GI bleeding has been reported as an adverse reaction in the clinical trials for midostaurin (brand name RYDAPT), a kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of blood cancers.

In the clinical trials for systemic mastocytosis, which included Studies 2 and 3, **gastrointestinal hemorrhage** was reported as one of the Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions, occurring in **14%** of patients treated with midostaurin (100 mg twice daily). This supports a causal relationship between midostaurin and the adverse reaction of GI bleeding. Additionally, for the patients treated for SM, GI bleeding was also among the adverse reactions that led to dose modifications in over 56% of patients, including dose interruption or reduction.

The most common adverse reactions in these systemic mastocytosis trials, which had a frequency of ≥ 20%, did not include GI bleeding but did cover other gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. However, these common reactions can be suggestive of underlying GI disturbances that might predispose to more severe outcomes like hemorrhage in some individuals.

The label also mentions that **gastrointestinal hemorrhage** led to treatment discontinuation in some cases and that serious adverse reactions were most commonly related (≥ 20%) to infections and gastrointestinal disorders, which may imply the significance of GI adverse effects in the overall safety profile of midostaurin.

No specific data from the provided label directly suggest an association between midostaurin and GI bleed in other indications, such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), nor is there a mention in the box warnings that would indicate this as an established risk known at the time of FDA approval.

Regarding post-marketing experience, while gastrointestinal hemorrhage is not explicitly specified, spontaneous case reports and literature cases inform about possible related complications, though their frequency or causal relationship to midostaurin is not well established due to the nature of voluntary reporting.

In summary, there is clear evidence from clinical trials in advanced systemic mastocytosis that GI bleed is a potential adverse reaction to midostaurin, with a considerable percentage of patients experiencing gastrointestinal hemorrhage. It is significant enough to lead to dose modifications and treatment discontinuations in some cases. However, the relationship between midostaurin and GI bleeding in other patient populations, such as those with AML, is not established based on the provided drug label sections.",NA
gi bleed,misoprostol,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, the following summary addresses the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and misoprostol drug exposure:

**Clinical Trials:** The most frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol in clinical trials were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The drug label does not specifically list GI bleeding as a common adverse event in the general population taking misoprostol in these trials. However, the section categorized as ""Causal relationship unknown"" mentions GI bleeding as an infrequently reported adverse event whose relationship with misoprostol has not been established but cannot be excluded.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:** While not explicitly detailed in the provided sections, post-marketing surveillance often encompasses reported adverse events once a drug is used in the general population beyond the controlled environment of clinical trials. The drug label implies that GI bleeding has been reported but does not clarify if this was identified through post-marketing surveillance. Regardless, a causal relationship between misoprostol exposure and GI bleeding is suggested as possible but not confirmed.

**Overall Evaluation:** Based on the evidence from the drug label, GI bleeding is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to misoprostol, although the causal relationship remains unestablished. It is considered an infrequent adverse event, with no clear evidence from controlled clinical trials that directly associates GI bleeding with misoprostol use. As with all medications, healthcare providers should monitor patients closely for any signs of adverse effects, including GI bleeding, especially in populations where such outcomes could pose significant health risks.

In summary, while GI bleeding has been reported as an adverse reaction in individuals exposed to misoprostol, it is classified under adverse reactions with a ""Causal relationship unknown,"" implying that a direct causal relationship has not been clearly established based on the available evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing reports as provided in the drug label.","Based on the provided drug label sections, there is mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleeding) under the category where the causal relationship is unknown for misoprostol. This indicates that while GI bleeding has been reported in the context of misoprostol use, the evidence does not establish a clear causal relationship between misoprostol and GI bleeding. However, it is important to note that the absence of a definitive causal link in the labeling does not entirely refute the possibility of such an association.

Clinical judgment, scrutiny of individual case reports, and further research may offer more insights into whether a true relationship exists. Clinicians are expected to consider the risk of GI bleeding as a potential, though not established, adverse reaction, and monitor patients accordingly, especially those with other risk factors for GI bleeding. 

To provide a more definitive conclusion on whether GI bleeding is not an adverse reaction of misoprostol, additional studies or clinical trial data that specifically investigate the incidence of GI bleeding in patients taking misoprostol compared to a control group would be required. Such evidence is not provided in the label and therefore cannot be summarized here. 

In summary, while GI bleeding is mentioned in the misoprostol drug label under events with an unknown causal relationship, the existing labeling does not definitively refute its potential as an adverse reaction. Further evidence is needed to clarify this relationship."
gi bleed,mitomycin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label regarding mitomycin, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a documented adverse reaction. The listed adverse reactions include bone marrow toxicity (with a high incidence of 64.4%), integument and mucous membrane toxicity, renal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and cardiac toxicity, among other side effects such as fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and less frequently reported problems like headache, vision blurring, confusion, drowsiness, syncope, fatigue, edema, and thrombophlebitis.

While GI bleeding is not explicitly listed, it is important to note that hematemesis (vomiting of blood) is mentioned as an adverse reaction. Hematemesis could be a sign of upper GI bleeding. However, it is not synonymous with GI bleeding in general, which can occur anywhere along the GI tract and may present as melena (black, tarry stools), hematochezia (passage of fresh blood per rectum), or in the vomit (hematemesis).

Mitomycin has been reported to cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure as part of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Thrombocytopenia, or low platelet count, could potentially contribute to increased bleeding risk, including GI bleeding, but the label does not establish a direct correlation between mitomycin use and GI bleeding incidents.

Given the absence of explicit evidence from the provided drug label sections, it cannot be concluded that there is a documented relationship between GI bleeding and mitomycin exposure based on the information at hand. For a comprehensive assessment, it would be necessary to review additional sources such as clinical trial data, case studies, and post-marketing reports that are not included in the provided text.

If considering known pharmacology, it is plausible that the drug could indirectly contribute to GI bleeding through its effects on platelets or by causing ulceration due to mucosal toxicity, but these are speculative considerations without specific evidence from the drug label to support a direct association between GI bleeding and mitomycin. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no known evidence supporting a relationship between GI bleeding and mitomycin. Additional sources beyond the drug label would be required for a more exhaustive review.",NA
gi bleed,mycophenolate mofetil,,"The evidence supporting a relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT) exposure comes from controlled clinical trials, postmarketing experience, and the known safety profile of the drug as outlined in the drug label.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
According to the provided drug label, the most serious gastrointestinal (GI) disorders reported during the pivotal clinical trials of CELLCEPT included ulceration and hemorrhage. Instances of mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis and colitis, were commonly reported. These findings are derived from randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients who were also receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy which includes cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

**Postmarketing Surveillance Evidence:**
Postmarketing reports, which represent voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, have identified GI bleeding as an adverse reaction in patients treated with CELLCEPT. The postmarketing surveillance complements clinical trial data by potentially capturing a wider range of adverse events in a larger and more diverse population, over a longer period, and in real-world settings.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
The provided drug label contains specific warnings related to gastrointestinal complications, which suggests a recognized risk of such complications, including GI bleeding, associated with the use of CELLCEPT. It advises monitoring for complications such as bleeding, which can require hospitalization, and taking special precautions in patients with underlying gastrointestinal disorders.

In summary, the relationship between GI bleeding and mycophenolate mofetil is supported by evidence from clinical trials, postmarketing reports, and is recognized in the drug's safety label. The reported gastrointestinal complications and advised monitoring for bleeding indicate that GI bleeding is an identified adverse reaction associated with CELLCEPT use.",NA
gi bleed,mycophenolic acid,,"The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and mycophenolic acid (MPA) can be inferred from sections 6.1 and 5.7 of the drug labeling information provided. While the text does not explicitly link MPA to GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction, there is evidence supporting an association:

1. Clinical Trial Evidence:
- The clinical studies section (6.1) discusses adverse reactions observed in trials but does not directly mention GI bleeding as a frequent or common adverse event. However, it does mention general gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea, vomiting, and dyspepsia, which had relatively high incidence rates.

2. Serious GI Complications:
- Section 5.7 discusses serious GI tract complications including GI bleeding, perforations, and ulcers. Although not elaborated, the fact that this is addressed under ""Warnings and Precautions"" suggests there is some level of concern or observed outcomes related to serious GI tract issues associated with the use of mycophenolic acid.

3. Postmarketing Experience:
- The postmarketing experience section (6.2) does not directly reference GI bleeding. However, the nature of post-marketing surveillance data, which is reported voluntarily and can be underreported, means that this does not rule out the likelihood of GI bleed occurring.

4. Specific Mention of GI Bleeding Risk Factors:
- Section 5.7 recommends caution when administering the drug to patients with active serious digestive system disease, acknowledging the potential for GI bleeding (among other severe complications).

In summary, while GI bleeding is not listed as one of the most common adverse reactions to mycophenolic acid, there is evidence suggesting a relationship. This is reflected in the drug's labeling under the Serious GI Tract Complications warning (5.7). The lack of explicit mention in the most common adverse reactions could suggest that GI bleeding is a less frequent or more severe reaction that warrants specific caution rather than being a routine adverse event. Additional evidence, including more detailed results from the clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, would be required to further evaluate the strength and specifics of this relationship.
",NA
gi bleed,nabumetone,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction and exposure to nabumetone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), includes data from clinical trials and post-marketing experience:

1. Clinical Trials:
   In the US clinical trials mentioned within the supplied drug label, GI bleeding is listed as a probable causally related adverse reaction under the “Incidence < 1% — Probably Causally Related” category. This categorization indicates that GI bleeding has been noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with nabumetone during clinical studies conducted in the United States.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   While gastrointestinal bleeding is not bolded or marked with an asterisk, suggesting that it was reported less frequently than those reactions that occurred in the 3-9% range, the inclusion of this adverse event in the “probably causally related” section implies that there have been reports of GI bleeding in the context of worldwide marketing experience. However, the absence of any italicized statement next to this adverse reaction suggests that no additional cases have been documented in the literature or in post-marketing surveillance that were not already observed in clinical trials.

3. Warnings:
   The drug label also includes a general warning about the risks of serious gastrointestinal adverse events associated with NSAIDs, stating that they ""cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal."" This general warning applies to nabumetone as it is part of the NSAID drug class, further supporting the association between nabumetone and potential GI bleeding.

Considering the information provided, GI bleeding is a recognized, though uncommon, adverse reaction to nabumetone, supported by clinical trial data and general pharmacological understanding of NSAID-related GI risks. It is important for prescribers and patients to be aware of this potential risk, particularly since the adverse events can occur without warning and at any time during treatment, with elderly patients being at greater risk.","NA
"
gi bleed,naltrexone,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for naltrexone hydrochloride, there does not appear to be any direct evidence linking naltrexone to gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction in the context of alcohol dependency treatment or opioid addiction.

The adverse reactions listed in clinical trials with naltrexone included nausea, headache, dizziness, nervousness, fatigue, insomnia, vomiting, anxiety, and somnolence, with a specific emphasis on hepatocellular injury at high doses, as well as symptoms potentially indicative of opioid withdrawal. However, gastrointestinal bleeds were not explicitly mentioned as an observed adverse effect.

The summary of postmarketing experience acknowledges that while a wide range of adverse events have been reported, there is difficulty distinguishing between events associated with drug therapy and those resulting from withdrawal syndrome. Events reported include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal complaints, but a specific connection to GI bleed is not detailed.

Additionally, the provided drug label sections discuss laboratory tests where transaminase elevations were noted, especially at higher doses, which could be reflective of hepatotoxicity. While liver function abnormalities can sometimes be associated with an increased risk of bleeding due to alterations in coagulation, the documentation does not directly associate naltrexone with a risk of GI bleed.

It is important to keep in mind that adverse events reported in postmarketing surveillance are not always conclusively linked to the drug, given they are self-reported and may be influenced by numerous confounders, including concurrent medications and underlying medical conditions.

In conclusion, there is no explicit evidence in the provided drug label sections that would support a direct relationship between naltrexone use (at recommended doses for alcohol dependence or opioid addiction treatment) and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeds. If evidence outside of the provided sections exists, it was not included in this summary, and it would be advisable to consult the full prescribing information or look to additional research and reports in the scientific literature for further insights.","Based on the information provided in the drug label for naltrexone hydrochloride, there is no evidence to suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is an adverse reaction associated with naltrexone at the recommended dose for alcohol dependence or opioid blockade. The adverse reactions listed in the clinical trials, observational studies, and postmarketing experience sections of the label include a range of side effects such as nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, vomiting, and various others, but GI bleeding is not mentioned.

Although extensive liver function abnormalities were noted at higher doses (5 times the recommended dose), these are mainly hepatocellular injuries rather than GI bleeding. It appears that in the studied populations for both alcohol dependence and opioid addiction, GI bleeding was neither a common adverse event nor a new-onset adverse event listed in the sections provided. Moreover, potential adverse reactions such as other gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea, abdominal pain/cramps, and ulcer are noted, which indicates that gastrointestinal side effects were considered and monitored during these trials.

Therefore, based on the absence of any reports of GI bleed in the clinical context presented in the drug label, it can be inferred that there is no evidence supporting a relationship between GI bleed and naltrexone use at the recommended dosages."
gi bleed,naproxen,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and naproxen exposure comes from multiple sources, including clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the drug's prescribing information.

Firstly, the prescribing information explicitly acknowledges GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction under section 6.1 (Clinical Trials Experience). It details clinical trial observations, where GI reactions were more frequent and severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking higher doses of naproxen (1500 mg daily) compared to lower doses (750 mg daily). The incidence of adverse reactions like heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, and gross bleeding/perforation is mentioned, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship between naproxen and GI adverse events.

Secondly, the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.2) of the label underscores the increased risk of serious GI events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, which can be fatal and may occur at any time during use, with or without warning symptoms. It also highlights that elderly patients and those with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at a greater risk for serious GI events.

Thirdly, the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section (6.2) supports the clinical trial findings by reporting instances of GI inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, perforation, and obstruction in post-approval use of naproxen. These reports, which are from a broader population and real-world use, offer practical insight into the drug’s risks beyond controlled clinical trials.

Finally, additional relevant information is provided in the ""Boxed Warning,"" the strongest warning by the FDA, which reinforces the risk of serious GI bleeding events associated with NSAID use, including naproxen. It is also emphasized that these adverse events can occur without warning and can be potentially life-threatening.

In summary, a robust body of evidence - including controlled clinical trials, post-marketing reports, and regulatory warnings - firmly establishes a relationship between naproxen exposure and the risk of GI bleeding. This information is clearly reflected in the drug’s prescribing information and is supported by the FDA's emphasis on the significance of these risks through highlighted boxed warnings.",NA
gi bleed,nefazodone,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance for nefazodone, there is no direct evidence mentioned that specifically links nefazodone to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or cites GI bleed as an observed adverse reaction.

The provided sections of the drug label for nefazodone discuss various adverse reactions from premarketing clinical trials and postmarketing experience, but GI bleed is not listed among them. However, there are other gastrointestinal adverse events reported such as nausea, constipation, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. There is also a mention of ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" but it is categorized under ""rare"" events without a direct attribution to nefazodone.

Moreover, in the postmarketing experience section, there is no specific mention of GI bleed as an adverse event. It is important to note that postmarketing experience often gathers a broader range of potential adverse events but establishing causality can be challenging due to the voluntary and observational nature of reporting.

Therefore, as per the available sections of the drug label provided, there is no known evidence to support a relationship between GI bleed and nefazodone exposure. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and report new or rare events to pharmacovigilance systems for further investigation.",NA
gi bleed,nelfinavir,,"The evidence surrounding the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and drug exposure to nelfinavir is inferred from the section on adverse reactions in the drug’s label. Nelfinavir, with the brand name VIRACEPT, is an antiretroviral medication used in the treatment of HIV. According to the label, the safety of VIRACEPT has been studied in over 5000 patients, with a range of adverse reactions reported.

Specifically, GI bleed is listed under the section ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Adults and Adolescents (13 years and older)"" within the Digestive System category, amongst adverse events that occurred in less than 2% of patients in all phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. These events were considered at least possibly related to, or of unknown relationship with, the treatment, and were of at least moderate severity.

The source of evidence for considering GI bleed as an adverse reaction comes from clinical trial data which monitored side effects during the drug’s development and testing phases. However, the exact incidence or prevalence of GI bleed related to nelfinavir use is not provided and seems to be low (less than 2%), given that the more common digestive system-related adverse events (such as diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence) were listed with specific percentages in Table 4. The data are therefore not robust enough to firmly establish causality, but there is a potential association indicated by its listing.

Furthermore, post-marketing surveillance, detailed in section ""6.3 Postmarketing Experience,"" does not list GI bleeding as an identified adverse reaction from the post-approval use of VIRACEPT. This could imply that the event was not reported with sufficient frequency in the post-marketing phase to warrant inclusion in this section; nonetheless, absence of evidence in the post-marketing data does not conclusively prove the absence of a relationship.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests a potential but not well-quantified relationship between GI bleeding and nelfinavir use based on its inclusion in the clinical trials' adverse reactions list, despite a low reported frequency. Solid conclusions cannot be made without more extensive data on the incidence of GI bleed in patients taking nelfinavir, and the information should be interpreted with caution considering the limitations of adverse event reporting and the fact that such reactions were not prominently noted in post-marketing surveillance.",NA
gi bleed,nifedipine,,"Based on the provided drug label information for nifedipine, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data provided. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker typically used to treat conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (chest pain).

The adverse reactions section of the drug label includes a range of potential side effects but does not list GI bleed. Most side effects are related to the vasodilatory effects of nifedipine and include dizziness, lightheadedness, flushing, headache, peripheral edema, and weakness, among others.

The gastrointestinal adverse effects reported at an incidence of 2% or less include diarrhea, constipation, cramps, and flatulence; at an incidence less than 0.5%, allergic hepatitis is mentioned—however, GI bleed is not explicitly reported in the provided sections.

Furthermore, hematologic adverse reactions mentioned with an incidence less than 0.5% include thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, and purpura. While thrombocytopenia could theoretically increase the risk of bleeding events, there is no specific association made with GI bleed and nifedipine in the label.

It should be noted that while the drug label is a comprehensive source of known drug-related information, including adverse reactions, it does not necessarily include all possible side effects or rare occurrences that might be identified after more extensive post-marketing surveillance or through individual case reports. Thus, healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to appropriate surveillance systems such as the FDA's MedWatch.

In summary, there is no evidence provided in the drug label information that GI bleed is a recognized adverse reaction of nifedipine based on the conducted clinical trials, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance data up to the knowledge cutoff. If further assessment is required, it can be useful to consult updated medical literature, databases, or post-marketing reports for any newly identified side effects or rare adverse reactions that may have been documented after the knowledge cutoff.",NA
gi bleed,nilotinib,,"The provided sections of the drug label for Tasigna (nilotinib) highlight several potential adverse reactions, but they do not explicitly list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or gi bleed as one of them. Instead, the sections mention hemorrhage under Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and describe bleeding from any site, suggesting a general risk for bleeding issues with the drug, which could conceivably include GI bleeding.

Relevant findings from the drug label are as follows:

- Section 5.9 describes ""serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events,"" in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with Tasigna. It mentions that Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% to 1.8% of patients across different dosing arms and specifically notes gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage in 2.9% to 5% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 events occurring in 0.7% to 1.4% of patients.

- In the ad-hoc sections titled Additional Data From Clinical Trials and Gastrointestinal Disorders, there’s a mention of GI hemorrhage and other related abnormalities such as GI ulcer perforation, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, hematemesis, gastric ulcer, and esophageal pain. However, a specific cumulative incidence rate for these was not provided.

The drug label advises monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding and medically managing as needed. This indicates that the risk of hemorrhagic events, potentially inclusive of GI bleeds, is an identified concern during treatment with Tasigna.

In summary, while GI bleed is not singled out as a distinct adverse reaction, evidence from the drug label indicates an increased risk of hemorrhage in general, including serious GI hemorrhages in a small percentage of patients. Clinicians prescribing Tasigna should be vigilant in monitoring patients for bleeding, including GI bleed, and manage the risks according to the standard guidelines.",NA
gi bleed,nilutamide,,"The medical evidence listed in the sections provided for the drug Nilutamide, known by the brand name Nilandron, does not specifically mention gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction. However, gastrointestinal hemorrhage was reported in 2% of patients treated with Nilutamide in combination with leuprolide or orchiectomy, based on the adverse reactions section of the drug label. The incidence is categorized in the range of adverse experiences that were reported in 2 to 5% of patients.

Importantly, even though GI bleeding is not highlighted as a major adverse effect, it is listed within the spectrum of less common adverse reactions that occurred in the clinical setting. Moreover, the drug label also mentions melena (dark, tarry stools which indicate bleeding in the GI tract) in 2% of patients.

Since the reported incidence is relatively low and the evidence does not indicate a strong and frequent association, it may suggest that GI bleeding is a potential but uncommon adverse reaction to Nilutamide. The GI bleeding cases could have various etiologies, and not necessarily a direct causative link to Nilutamide, but it remains important for clinicians to consider this potential adverse reaction, especially in patients who might be at higher risk for bleeding complications.

While clinical trials and case studies are primary sources for identifying adverse reactions, post-marketing surveillance also plays a crucial role, particularly for rare or long-term effects that may not have been detected in clinical trials. In this case, the label does not provide specific information from post-marketing surveillance regarding GI bleeding.

In summary, while gastrointestinal hemorrhage is reported as an adverse experience in the drug label for Nilutamide, it is reported at a low incidence (2%). Clinicians should consider the potential for GI bleeding when prescribing Nilutamide, and monitor patients accordingly, especially those with risk factors for bleeding. For a precise and specific evaluation of the association between GI bleeding and Nilutamide use, additional studies or post-marketing surveillance data would be beneficial.",NA
gi bleed,nimodipine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and exposure to nimodipine comes from adverse event reporting in clinical trials. According to the drug label sections provided, GI bleeding is listed as an adverse event with an incidence rate of less than 1% in two dosing groups of nimodipine during a clinical trial: the 60 mg every 4 hours (q4h) dose group and the 90 mg q4h dose group. This information suggests that there were reports of GI bleeding among patients receiving nimodipine, although the occurrence was rare.

The table in the adverse reactions section shows common side effects that patients experienced when treated with nimodipine. While the side effects most frequently associated with nimodipine based on an increased incidence with a higher dose or compared to placebo include decreased blood pressure, edema, and headaches, GI bleeding is not among the common adverse events, as it had a reported incidence of less than 1%. This indicates that GI bleeding is a potential adverse reaction but is not a common or well-characterized response to nimodipine.

Adverse events like GI bleeding are critically important to monitor, and the label advises healthcare professionals and patients to report suspected adverse reactions to the Bionpharma Inc. or the FDA through provided contact information.

Furthermore, it is important to consider that patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which nimodipine is most commonly prescribed, may experience altered consciousness that could lead to underreporting of adverse experiences, including GI symptoms. The label also notes that no clinically significant effects on hematologic factors or renal or hepatic function, which could potentially contribute to bleeding events, have been causally associated with oral nimodipine, suggesting no broad evidence of a direct link between nimodipine and systemic effects that might lead to GI bleeding.

To summarize, there is limited evidence from clinical trials suggesting that GI bleeding can occur as an adverse reaction to nimodipine, but the incidence appears to be very low (<1%). These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the potential for underreporting of adverse reactions and the lack of a clear causal relationship. Further post-marketing surveillance and clinical studies would be needed to better characterize this potential adverse reaction.",NA
gi bleed,nisoldipine,,"The provided drug label information for nisoldipine, a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension, outlines various adverse reactions reported by patients who have used the drug in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. A review of the provided sections (Adverse Reactions, Warnings, and Box Warnings) reveals several adverse events associated with nisoldipine.

Among the listed adverse events, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is mentioned under the Digestive category, which could be interpreted as including gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). However, this event is categorized as occurring in ≤1% of all patients treated for hypertension with nisoldipine in U.S. and foreign clinical trials, which implies it is a relatively rare event. There is no explicit indication whether this reported GI bleed was a direct and confirmed adverse reaction due to nisoldipine or a coincidental finding, as the causal relationship cannot be established from the information provided.

No specific clinical trials or case studies solely attributing GI bleed to nisoldipine exposure are detailed in the information, and the drug label does not include a warning or box warning specifically for GI bleed as an established adverse reaction. The absence of strong evidence or explicit warnings suggests that, while there have been instances of GI bleed reported, there may not be sufficient or robust data to directly connect this adverse reaction causally to the drug.

Therefore, the summary of evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction and nisoldipine exposure is limited and inconclusive based on the drug label sections provided. GI bleed was noted in ≤1% of patients but no certain causal link to nisoldipine has been established in the available literature. More in-depth research including pharmacovigilance data, larger scale clinical trials, or observational studies would be required to further elucidate and confirm this relationship.",NA
gi bleed,nitisinone,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence supporting a relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and nitisinone exposure. The adverse reactions section (6.1) of the label lists various adverse events experienced by patients treated with nitisinone, but GI bleeding per se, or specifically a gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed), is not mentioned as a common adverse reaction (>1%). 

However, the less common adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of patients include gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena (black, tarry stools which can indicate bleeding in the upper GI tract). This suggests that there have been some rare instances of GI bleeding in patients taking nitisinone, but the incidence is very low and not among the most frequently observed adverse reactions.

Additionally, the clinical trials experience described in section 6.1 does not indicate GI bleed as a common or serious adverse reaction. The safety of NITYR, a formulation of nitisinone, is based on studies of another oral formulation used in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1), and no specific reference to GI bleed as a widespread issue is given.

Warnings and precautions (sections 5.1 and 5.2) discuss ocular symptoms, developmental delays, hyperkeratotic plaques owing to elevated plasma tyrosine levels, leukopenia, and severe thrombocytopenia, but there is no mention of GI bleeding as a concern in these sections either.

In conclusion, while there is mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena as adverse reactions in less than 1% of patients treated with another oral formulation of nitisinone, there is not enough evidence in the provided drug label sections to suggest a definitive relationship between nitisinone exposure and GI bleed as a significant adverse event. It should be noted that post-marketing surveillance and additional studies outside of this labeling information could potentially provide more insight into the relationship between nitisinone treatment and GI bleeding, but such evidence is not included in the provided text. If evaluating this potential adverse reaction is critical, one should consult the most up-to-date medical literature and post-marketing data for further information.",NA
gi bleed,octreotide,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction to octreotide (brand name MYCAPSSA) in the context of the reported adverse reactions, warnings, or post-marketing experiences. The gastrointestinal adverse events that were reported in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance predominantly include symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and similar issues, with no direct reference to GI bleeding or hemorrhage.

However, in the post-marketing experience section, ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" is listed without further details regarding its frequency or the establishment of a causal relationship with octreotide exposure. Post-marketing experiences can provide initial signals of potential adverse reactions not captured during clinical trials, but they require more rigorous evaluation to establish causality due to their voluntary and often less systematic nature.

In summary, while there is no clear and direct evidence from the clinical trials that GI bleeding is an adverse reaction of octreotide, there is a mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the post-marketing experience. This suggests the possibility, although more data would be needed to establish a definitive relationship. Clinicians should remain vigilant for this potential adverse event and report any suspected cases to further contribute to the safety profile of the drug.

gi bleed,omacetaxine mepesuccinate,,"Based on the drug label provided for omacetaxine mepesuccinate (brand name SYNRIBO), there is evidence supporting a relationship between the exposure to this drug and the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The label explicitly mentions bleeding as a clinically significant adverse reaction encountered in clinical trials and is discussed further in the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2) of the label.

From the Warnings and Precautions section (5.2), the drug is reported to cause severe thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of hemorrhage. Fatalities from cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients in the safety population, and there were instances of severe, non-fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhages in 2% of the patients. While this specific section does not detail the exact incidence of GI bleeding, the context suggests that it is a recognized adverse event, likely due to thrombocytopenia, a decrease in platelet counts that omacetaxine mepesuccinate can induce.

Additionally, in the Clinical Trials Experience section (6.1), detailing safety data from three clinical trials, the most commonly occurring adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia and bleeding events, although GI bleeding is not singled out. The mention of bleeding generally being associated with the noted severe thrombocytopenia suggests a plausible mechanism for GI bleeding as an adverse reaction.

Finally, under Gastrointestinal Disorders in the additional data from the safety population (6.2), gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as an adverse reaction reported between 1% to less than 10% frequency, which aligns with the warning about bleeding risks.

In summary, while the exact rate of GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to omacetaxine mepesuccinate is not provided, there is clear evidence from clinical trial data and post-marketing experience within the safety population that links the drug with an increased risk of bleeding, including serious instances such as cerebral and GI bleeding. This is supported by both the safety data gathered from clinical trials and the Warnings and Precautions sections of the drug label, indicating a recognized relationship between omacetaxine mepesuccinate exposure and GI bleeding as an adverse reaction.",NA
gi bleed,omacetaxine mepesuccinate,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and exposure to omacetaxine mepesuccinate, sold under the brand name SYNRIBO, is found within sections 6 and 5 of the drug label. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate is a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant or intolerant to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
The safety data from three clinical trials involving a total of 163 adult patients with chronic phase (CP) and accelerated phase (AP) CML demonstrates that bleeding is a clinically significant adverse reaction associated with SYNRIBO. The adverse reactions section lists epistaxis (nosebleeds) occurring in 17% of CP CML patients and 11% of AP CML patients, and serious adverse reactions of bleeding were reported, though GI bleeding is not explicitly quantified in the tabulated data presented in this section.

Warnings and Precautions (Sections 5.1 and 5.2):
The label emphasizes the risk of severe thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), which greatly increases the risk of hemorrhage, including severe, non-fatal GI hemorrhages which occurred in 2% of patients in the safety population. This is a direct acknowledgment of GI bleeding as a potential adverse reaction to SYNRIBO.

Two fatalities from cerebral hemorrhage were documented in patients with CP CML, illustrating the drug's potential to cause severe bleeding events in the presence of thrombocytopenia.

Moreover, section 5.2 explicitly advises caution in the use of medications that could exacerbate bleeding risk, such as anticoagulants, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly when the patient's platelet count is below 50,000/µL.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
There is no specifically mentioned evidence of GI bleed related to omacetaxine mepesuccinate in the post-marketing surveillance context within the provided drug label sections.

In conclusion, the relationship between GI bleed and omacetaxine mepesuccinate use is supported by clinical trials data and safety warnings on the drug label. Bleeding, including severe GI hemorrhage, is recognized as a significant risk of thrombocytopenia induced by the drug, with specific cases of severe GI bleeding documented in the treated population. Additional post-marketing surveillance could potentially provide further evidence, but such data is not provided in the current summary.",NA
gi bleed,orlistat,0.0,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for orlistat (marketed as XENICAL), there is mention of various gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions associated with its use in clinical trials and post-marketing experience, but there does not appear to be direct evidence from clinical trials explicitly linking orlistat to GI bleeding. The most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions for orlistat are related to its mechanism of action on fat absorption and include events such as oily spotting, flatus with discharge, fecal urgency, fatty/oily stool, oily evacuation, increased defecation, and fecal incontinence.

However, under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section of the drug label, it is stated that ""lower gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported in patients treated with XENICAL."" It's important to note that reports from post-marketing surveillance often lack detailed information that would allow for definitive attributions of causality. Therefore, while there have been reports of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the postmarketing phase, a causal relationship to XENICAL exposure has not been conclusively established.

No specific incidents or detailed evidence from clinical trials is mentioned in the label regarding GI bleeding, suggesting that if GI bleeding occurred during clinical trials, it was not among the most frequent adverse reactions, or it did not have a clear causal link to orlistat use. Clinical trials did report various gastrointestinal symptoms, but none explicitly cited GI bleed within the description of adverse events.

It's also relevant to note that in these types of documents, the term ""lower gastrointestinal bleeding"" may be referring to a wide range of conditions, including but not limited to serious events such as a GI bleed. It could also encompass less severe symptoms similar to those reported in the clinical trials.

In conclusion, post-marketing reports indicate a potential association between orlistat use and GI bleeding, yet this is not substantiated by direct evidence from clinical trials according to the drug label details provided. When evaluating drug safety, it is essential to rely on a comprehensive analysis of all available data, including clinical trial results, post-marketing surveillance, and case reports, to establish a clear understanding of potential adverse reactions.",NA
gi bleed,oseltamivir,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, gastrointestinal bleeding, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, is identified as an adverse reaction to oseltamivir phosphate in the post-marketing experience (section 6.2). This categorization indicates that GI bleed has been reported as an adverse reaction following the approval of the drug, through voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and consumers.

However, it is important to note that these post-marketing reports do not necessarily provide sufficient data to establish a causal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse reaction because they are often based on a population of uncertain size and may lack detailed information. Additionally, GI bleed is not listed as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trial data presented for both adult/adolescent and pediatric subjects (section 6.1).

In summary, while there is some evidence from post-marketing surveillance indicating that GI bleed can occur as an adverse reaction to oseltamivir phosphate, the available data do not allow for a definitive conclusion about causality. Further investigation, such as additional clinical studies or detailed case reports, may be needed to better understand the relationship between oseltamivir and GI bleed.

Sources: 
- Drug label sections 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS and 6.2 Post-marketing Experience.","The provided drug label sections on oseltamivir (commonly known by its brand name, Tamiflu) detail the observed adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience. The evidence for gastrointestinal disorders lists nausea and vomiting as common adverse reactions, but there is no explicit mention of GI bleeding as an adverse reaction in the provided sections of the drug label.

To address whether there is evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and oseltamivir:

The clinical trials experience did not report GI bleeding as an adverse event in the treatment and prophylaxis trials in adult, adolescent, and pediatric subjects. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported gastrointestinal issues.

In the post-marketing experience section, while gastrointestinal bleeding is mentioned, this type of reporting does not establish frequency or a causal relationship to oseltamivir exposure due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the unknown size of the exposed population.

The evidence provided does not explicitly confirm or refute the relationship between GI bleed and oseltamivir, as the information from clinical trials does not report it as a common adverse event, and the post-marketing section's mention of gastrointestinal bleeding does not confirm causality.

Therefore, based on the provided drug label sections, there is no conclusive evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and oseltamivir, but there is an absence of clear indications from clinical trials that it is a common or expected adverse reaction."
gi bleed,oxaliplatin,,"Based on the comprehensive information provided, there is no direct evidence mentioned in the drug label sections for oxaliplatin that gi bleed (gastrointestinal bleeding) is a validated adverse reaction attributable to oxaliplatin exposure. However, there are references to hemorrhagic events, which can be seen as indirect evidence supporting the potential for gi bleed as an adverse reaction to oxaliplatin:

1. Clinical Trials Experience: The section 6.1 of the drug label under 'Adjuvant Treatment' reports that grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 0.2% of patients within the clinical trial settings.
   
2. Postmarketing Experience: As per section 6.2, gastrointestinal bleeding is listed as a fatal adverse reaction identified during post-approval usage of oxaliplatin, but a precise frequency or establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure cannot be reliably estimated.

It is important to note the difference between clinically controlled trials and post-marketing surveillance. Clinical trials are conducted under strict and controlled conditions with selected patients, while post-marketing surveillance data comes from a much broader, real-world patient population after the drug has been approved for use. 

The data from clinical trials suggest that the occurrence of severe gastrointestinal bleeding is relatively rare (0.2% incidence), with no apparent grading of severity mentioned for gi bleed specifically. Meanwhile, the post-marketing experience suggests that there have been reports of gastrointestinal bleeding during the use of oxaliplatin, but these reports are voluntary and do not necessarily confirm causation; they only indicate that such an association has been observed.

In summary, while gastrointestinal bleeding is mentioned as a potential adverse event associated with oxaliplatin use both in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, it is not a prominently featured or common adverse effect. The direct evidence for gi bleed as a specific adverse reaction of oxaliplatin is limited but suggests a possible association. It is essential when prescribing oxaliplatin to be cognizant of its potential to cause bleeding, albeit rarely, and to monitor patients accordingly. Health professionals should report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate drug safety monitoring systems to contribute to the body of evidence and promote better understanding of drug-related risks.",NA
gi bleed,oxaprozin,1.0,"Evidence Summary for GI Bleed as an Adverse Reaction of Oxaprozin:

Clinical Trials Evidence:
- The clinical trials experience section within the drug labeling refers to gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with oxaprozin. Specifically, it mentions that gastrointestinal ulcers (gastric/duodenal), gross bleeding/perforation, hematemesis, and hemorrhoidal or rectal bleeding occurred at an incidence greater than 1% in clinical trials of oxaprozin.
- Additionally, it states that upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs, which include oxaprozin, occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months and about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year, indicating a clear, although low, risk of serious GI adverse events directly related to the drug use over time.

Post-marketing Surveillance:
- In the post-marketing surveillance data, the document identifies GI adverse reactions without assigning specific frequencies or establishing a certain causal relationship due to the voluntary nature of these reports. However, it acknowledges that serious GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation events have been observed post-approval and remain associated with NSAID use.

Boxed Warnings and Warnings & Precautions:
- The drug label contains a boxed warning about the risk of serious GI events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. It is noted that these events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms.
- Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at a greater risk for serious GI events.
- Risk minimization strategies included within the Warnings and Precautions section advocate for using the lowest effective oxaprozin dose for the shortest duration necessary to mitigate the chances of GI adverse events.

In summary, based on the provided drug label information, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience that corroborates gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse reaction to oxaprozin. This is supported by the observed incidence in clinical trials and the inclusion of this risk in the boxed warning, which is aimed at drawing attention to the serious and potentially life-threatening risks of GI bleeding associated with oxaprozin use.",NA
gi bleed,oxcarbazepine,,"The provided drug label sections for oxcarbazepine include extensive details on adverse reactions, but there is no mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or hemorrhage as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials or post-marketing experience for oxcarbazepine. The listed adverse reactions primarily involve the central nervous system (such as dizziness, somnolence, headache, ataxia), as well as other body systems. 

The only mention of the digestive system includes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and dyspepsia. Hemorrhagic events are not noted as a common adverse effect in the clinical trials or post-marketing data sections provided. 

Under postmarketing experience, there is a mention of ""hemorrhage rectum,"" which could potentially indicate a rectal bleed, but this is not specified as a GI bleed. Moreover, it is not explicitly stated whether these rectal hemorrhages were direct adverse reactions to the drug or related to other factors.

In summary, based on the information provided in the drug label, there is no clear evidence supporting GI bleed as a common adverse reaction to oxcarbazepine. Any potential relationship between oxcarbazepine and GI bleed would require further investigation, such as assessment of individual case reports in post-marketing surveillance that detail such an event, to establish a causative link, if any. It is important for healthcare professionals to report suspected adverse reactions to drug regulatory authorities to aid in the detection of rare or serious adverse effects that may not have been observed in initial clinical trials.",NA
gi bleed,pamidronate,,"Based on the information provided in the drug label, there is no direct evidence cited that associates gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with pamidronate use. The adverse reactions section for pamidronate lists various potential side effects observed during clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and other studies. While this section includes a variety of gastrointestinal adverse events such as abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia, GI bleeding is specifically mentioned only once under the gastrointestinal section within the treatment-related adverse experiences table, occurring in a small percentage (0%) in three U.S. controlled clinical trials for patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with pamidronate disodium.

It is important to highlight that the occurrence of ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" (which may include GI bleed) is reported as an adverse event with a frequency of 0% in the specific dose and duration of pamidronate disodium (90 mg over 24 hr) when compared to etidronate disodium and saline. This suggests that in the clinical trials referenced, GI bleeding was not a common treatment-related adverse reaction to pamidronate disodium.

However, it is worth noting that adverse experiences may be underreported or underrecognized in clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance can reveal additional side effects not captured during the initial studies. According to the post-marketing experience section of the drug label, there is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding as an observed adverse reaction after the approval of pamidronate disodium. Therefore, it can be concluded that, based on the available evidence presented in the provided sections of the drug label, there is no substantial evidence directly linking pamidronate to GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction.

As with all medications, it is essential to report any unexpected or serious side effects to healthcare providers and regulatory authorities to ensure ongoing monitoring of drug safety. Patients should discuss potential risks with their healthcare providers before starting treatment with pamidronate disodium or any other medication.","NA

Based on the provided sections of the drug label for pamidronate, there is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions listed include other gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, and vomiting, but these do not directly refute or confirm an association between GI bleed and pamidronate use.

Furthermore, among the clinical studies and post-marketing experiences detailed, there is no evidence explicitly stating that GI bleed is not an adverse reaction of pamidronate. Without specific studies or data analyzing the incidence of GI bleed in patients taking pamidronate compared to a control group, it is not possible to provide evidence refuting the relationship. Clinical trial data typically report only those adverse reactions observed during the studies, and the absence of a reported condition does not equate to evidence of absence.

If there were evidence supporting or refuting the relationship, it would include epidemiological studies, clinical trials with control groups, case-control studies, cohort studies, or case reports that specifically looked at the incidence of GI bleed in patients taking pamidronate versus those who were not. Since no such evidence is included in the provided text, the summary must conclude with ""NA,"" indicating no available evidence refuting the relationship."
gi bleed,pantoprazole,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label sections you shared, gi bleed is not listed as either a common or a rare adverse reaction reported in clinical trials or post-marketing experience for pantoprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The clinical trials section (6.1) does not mention gi bleed as an observed adverse reaction in adult or pediatric patients treated with pantoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, or other related conditions. The most common adverse reactions in adults were headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. In pediatric patients, the most reported reactions were upper respiratory infection, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

In the post-marketing experience section (6.2), various adverse reactions have been identified, but gi bleed is not explicitly mentioned among them. This section includes several gastrointestinal disorders like fundic gland polyps but not gi bleeding.

Lastly, the warnings and precautions (5) do not include gi bleed as a recognized risk or complication of pantoprazole use. Potential risks that are mentioned involve gastric malignancy, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, bone fracture, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, lupus erythematosus, vitamin deficiencies, and mineral metabolism disturbances.

Therefore, based on the summarization of the provided drug label sections, there is no known evidence in the provided sections supporting that gi bleed is an adverse reaction of pantoprazole in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. It is important to note that adverse reactions not observed in trials may still occur and should be monitored and reported to health authorities if detected. If gi bleed is suspected to be related to pantoprazole use, it should be reported to the relevant channels such as healthcare providers or the FDA's MedWatch system for further evaluation.","NA

According to the provided drug label sections for pantoprazole, there is no mention of GI bleed as an adverse reaction either in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. However, it should be noted that the absence of a specific adverse reaction in a drug label does not necessarily mean that the reaction cannot occur. The lack of mention may be due to a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, the rarity of the event, lack of clear evidence linking the event to the drug, or insufficient data at the time of label writing. Clinicians should monitor patients for any adverse effects not listed on the drug label and report them to pharmacovigilance systems to contribute to the understanding of the drug's safety profile."
gi bleed,paricalcitol,,"Based on the information provided from the sections detailing adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings from the drug label, there is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) directly associated with the administration of paricalcitol. The clinical trial experience documented in the label includes a variety of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting, but GI bleed is not listed among them.

Furthermore, in the post-marketing experience section, which includes adverse reactions identified after approval, there is no explicit mention of GI bleed being reported. However, it is important to note that post-marketing surveillance data may not be comprehensive due to underreporting and the voluntary nature of such reporting systems.

Thus, based on the provided sections of the paricalcitol drug label, there is no known evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance to support a direct relationship between paricalcitol exposure and the occurrence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction.

To determine if there is a potential relationship, it would be necessary to review the full range of available medical literature, including case reports and epidemiological studies that might indicate a correlation. However, as per the data provided, no such evidence is cited.",NA
gi bleed,paroxetine,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for Paroxetine, there is no explicitly stated direct evidence linking Paroxetine with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse event.

The label details various adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, postmarketing experiences, and other observations during the premarketing evaluation of Paroxetine. The reported adverse effects range from common ones like nausea, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, and decreased appetite to less frequent and rare events such as dyspepsia and various gastrointestinal disorders. However, in the sections provided, there is no specific mention of GI bleed as a recognized adverse event directly attributed to Paroxetine usage.

It should be noted that while GI bleed is not explicitly listed, there are mentions of gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea, rectal hemorrhage (which is bleeding from the rectum), and other conditions that could theoretically be related to or potentially exacerbate a GI bleed. Nevertheless, without clear evidence or specific mention of GI bleed, it cannot be conclusively stated that there is a relationship between Paroxetine and GI bleeding based on this label information.

If assessing the potential risk of GI bleed with Paroxetine or other similar medications, one might consider consulting more comprehensive sources such as case studies, reviews of related medications within the same drug class (SSRIs, which have had associations with increased gastrointestinal bleeding), or seek updated safety information that may not be present in the provided labeling sections.

In the absence of direct evidence within the label, a healthcare provider should use clinical judgment and consider the entirety of a patient's medical history, concomitant medications (such as anticoagulants or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which can increase GI bleeding risk), and other risk factors when evaluating individual risk for GI bleeding with Paroxetine treatment.",NA
gi bleed,peginterferon alfa-2a,,"The information provided from the drug label does not explicitly list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a known adverse reaction to peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS). However, there is mention of life-threatening or fatal events that include conditions affecting the digestive system such as gastrointestinal disorders and pancreatitis in the context of serious adverse events (SAEs). Moreover, other gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are listed (section 6.1). Gastrointestinal bleeding could potentially fall under the broader category of gastrointestinal disorders or under SAEs, which are less common.

In clinical studies (section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience), one or more serious adverse reactions occurred in a significant fraction of subjects, ranging from 10% in CHC monoinfected subjects to 19% in CHC/HIV subjects when receiving PEGASYS alone or in combination with ribavirin (COPEGUS). Furthermore, gastrointestinal disorders were among the most common serious adverse reactions observed in these populations. However, the information provided does not explicitly break down these gastrointestinal disorders into specific conditions, such as GI bleed.

Most adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial experience (Table 7) for PEGASYS monotherapy and PEGASYS/COPEGUS combination therapy were not directly related to bleeding complications. The same applies to the sections discussing laboratory values (section 6 Laboratory Values), immunogenicity (section 6.2), and the postmarketing experience (section 6.3), which do not specifically mention GI bleed.

In summary, based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse reaction to peginterferon alfa-2a in the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data. However, Serious Adverse Events that include gastrointestinal disorders, which could potentially encompass GI bleed, are noted to occur. Should there be additional information from studies or case reports outside of the information provided here, those could offer more context on the potential for GI bleed as an adverse reaction to peginterferon alfa-2a.",NA
gi bleed,piroxicam,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and piroxicam use comes from different sources as highlighted in the drug label:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience:** GI adverse events such as anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia were reported in clinical trials. However, these trials do not directly compare the adverse reaction rates to those of other drugs.

2. **Postmarketing Experience:** The postmarketing data, collected from voluntary reports, has identified GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to piroxicam. Reports include gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, ulcers (gastric/duodenal), hematemesis, melena, and rectal bleeding. The causal relationship to drug exposure is harder to establish since this data comes from a population of uncertain size and reports are voluntarily submitted.

3. **Boxed Warnings:** The label includes a boxed warning about an increased risk of serious GI adverse events such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines due to NSAID use, which can be fatal. These adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk.

4. **Risk Factors:** The drug label lists factors increasing the risk of GI bleeding in NSAID-treated patients, which include longer duration of usage, concomitant medications (like corticosteroids, anticoagulants), smoking, alcohol use, older age, and poor general health.

5. **Strategies to Minimize Risks:** The label advises using the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration necessary, avoiding concurrent use of multiple NSAIDs, and exercising caution in patients at high risk of bleeding.

The drug label provides detailed information indicating that GI bleeding is a known and serious adverse effect associated with the use of piroxicam, an NSAID, which is substantiated by both clinical trial data and post-marketing reports. The aforementioned details reflect systematically reviewed and vetted information from both controlled settings and real-world usage that establish the relationship between piroxicam and the potential adverse reaction of GI bleed.","NA

The provided drug label sections indicate that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ulceration, and perforation are known adverse reactions of piroxicam and are detailed in the Warnings and Precautions (5.2) of the label. Therefore, this adverse reaction is recognized as being associated with piroxicam exposure and no evidence is presented within these sections to refute this relationship."
gi bleed,pomalidomide,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for pomalidomide, evidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction to pomalidomide is mentioned under the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section. This section reports that gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been identified through post-approval use of the drug, which means that the relationship between pomalidomide exposure and GI bleed has been observed in patients after the drug was marketed. However, because postmarketing reports are based on voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size, it is often difficult to determine the precise frequency of the reaction or to establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure.

It is important to note that the ""Clinical Trials Experience"" section, which summarizes data from clinical trials (Trial 1 and 2, and Trial 12-C-0047), does not list gastrointestinal hemorrhage or GI bleed as an observed adverse reaction. This implies that GI bleed was not identified as a common adverse reaction in the controlled settings of the clinical trials reported in the provided drug label.

Thus, the evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed and pomalidomide primarily comes from postmarketing surveillance and not from the preliminary clinical trial data prior to the drug's approval.

In summary, while there is no mention of GI bleed as a common adverse reaction in the reviewed clinical trials for pomalidomide, there is an indication in the postmarketing experience of a possible association. Given that the information is derived from post-approval use reports, further investigation would be needed to confirm the strength and consistency of the relationship between pomalidomide and GI bleed. Health care professionals should report observed adverse reactions to further enhance the understanding of the drug’s safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,pomalidomide,,"The drug label for pomalidomide (POMALYST) does not explicitly list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction. However, among the postmarketing experiences, there is mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal bleeding or GI bleed.

Evidence from Clinical Trials:
The provided safety data from clinical trials 1 and 2 and trial 12-C-0047 for pomalidomide do not explicitly report GI bleed as a common adverse reaction (under the gastrointestinal disorders sections in Tables 3 and 4, for instance, GI bleed is not listed but other gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation are).

Postmarketing Surveillance:
The mention of ""Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" in the postmarketing experience section indicates that there have been reports of such events following the approval and widespread use of pomalidomide. Since these reports are voluntary and come from a population of uncertain size, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure.

While GI bleed is not listed as a common adverse effect in the clinical trials data, the postmarketing reports suggest that it is a potential risk, though the exact incidence is not clearly established. It is essential to consider that data from postmarketing surveillance can be less systematic than data from clinical trials and may be subject to underreporting or reporting bias.

Source of the evidence:
- The provided pomalidomide drug label sections (6.2 Postmarketing Experience).

In summary, the evidence for GI bleed as an adverse reaction of pomalidomide primarily comes from postmarketing surveillance reports and not from the adverse reactions reported in the referenced clinical trials for pomalidomide. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for GI bleeding as a possible adverse reaction during pomalidomide therapy, and report any such events to further contribute to the surveillance data.",NA
gi bleed,potassium chloride,1.0,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for potassium chloride, gastrointestinal (GI) irritation is recognized as an adverse reaction that could potentially lead to more serious GI issues, such as a GI bleed, if the drug is not properly diluted or taken with food. While the label does not explicitly mention GI bleeding, gastrointestinal irritation could encompass a range of symptoms including mild discomfort to more severe conditions like ulcers or bleeding, given the irritating nature of potassium chloride on the GI mucosa.

Specifically, Section 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS mentions that potassium chloride may cause gastrointestinal irritation if administered undiluted and advises for increased dilution and intake with meals to mitigate this effect. This implies that taking undiluted potassium chloride could lead to more severe forms of GI irritation.

The provided drug label sections (6 ADVERSE REACTIONS and 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS) list nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal pain/discomfort, and diarrhea as the most common adverse effects but do not explicitly mention GI bleeding as an outcome of the drug’s administration. However, abdominal pain and discomfort could be indicative of various underlying gastrointestinal issues, possibly including GI bleeding in more severe cases.

The evidence from the drug label suggests that there is recognition of potential gastrointestinal irritation associated with potassium chloride use, and it is reasonable to infer that this could escalate to GI bleeding in certain contexts. However, there is no direct evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance explicitly linking potassium chloride with GI bleeding provided in the sections of the label you've presented.

It is essential to consider that drug labels may not list every possible side effect or adverse reaction, and they sometimes focus on the most common or clinically significant ones as identified through clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. Therefore, while GI bleeding is not explicitly stated in the provided label sections, healthcare providers often use their clinical judgment and understanding of drug pharmacology to infer potential adverse reactions not directly listed.

In summary, the provided drug label information acknowledges the gastrointestinal irritation potential of potassium chloride, which may manifest as various adverse effects, possibly including GI bleeding particularly if the medication is not properly diluted or taken with food. For conclusive evidence linking potassium chloride to GI bleeding, a review of broader clinical data, including studies and case reports not found within the label, would be necessary.",NA
gi bleed,potassium iodide,,"The evidence regarding gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction to potassium iodide is primarily drawn from the drug labeling, which includes the manufacturer's summary of data gathered from clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance. According to the drug label, GI bleeding is listed among the less frequent adverse reactions to potassium iodide. Although the label does not go into detail regarding specific incidents or the prevalence of this side effect, the inclusion of GI bleeding suggests that there have been observed cases or a plausible mechanism for such a reaction during the drug's usage.

Given that no specific clinical trials, case studies, or post-market surveillance data are provided regarding GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to potassium iodide, the exact strength of the evidence cannot be fully assessed. However, the presence of this side effect on the label implies that health authorities and the manufacturer have acknowledged a potential link.

It is also important to consider that adverse reactions such as GI bleeding can vary in intensity and may depend on individual susceptibility, dosage, duration of therapy, and co-existing medical conditions or medications that could exacerbate this side effect.

The evidence to support the relationship between GI bleeding and potassium iodide exposure is therefore based on drug labeling, which reflects an aggregation of medical observation and reporting. For more detailed information on the frequency and severity of this reaction, further investigation into clinical databases, medical literature, and pharmacovigilance reports would be required. If such data were available, it would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the risk associated with potassium iodide exposure.",NA
gi bleed,pramipexole,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence specifically linking pramipexole, a medication primarily used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (RLS), to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction. The common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance for pramipexole include a range of neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal effects, but GI bleed is not explicitly mentioned.

In the sections detailing the clinical trials experience for both early and advanced Parkinson's disease, as well as RLS, adverse reactions such as nausea, constipation, and other digestive system issues are mentioned, but no mention of GI bleeding is made. The postmarketing experience also lists vomiting as a gastrointestinal disorder but does not report GI bleeding.

It's worth noting that while a comprehensive list of adverse reactions is provided, including common and dose-related reactions, GI bleed is not included amongst them in either the sections related to adverse reactions (6.1, 6.2) or in the safety warnings and precautions (5). 

In absence of specific mention or documentation, it is reasonable to conclude that GI bleed has not been recognized or reported as a common or well-established adverse reaction to pramipexole in the available clinical trial data or postmarketing surveillance according to the drug label provided.

For the most accurate and personalized medical advice, always consult a healthcare professional. In the context of a specific patient case or in the presence of other risk factors for GI bleeding, a clinician may consider a more nuanced assessment.","NA

Based on the information provided from the drug label, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is not listed as an adverse reaction, nor mentioned in the context of warnings or postmarketing experience for pramipexole. Therefore, there is no evidence provided above refuting the relationship between GI bleed and pramipexole because GI bleed is not recognized as a potential adverse reaction of pramipexole. Without specific data or case reports linking pramipexole to GI bleeding, no summary of evidence refuting the relationship can be given. If such evidence becomes available, it should be evaluated to determine the strength of any association."
gi bleed,prasugrel,,"The relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and prasugrel exposure is supported by evidence from the TRITON-TIMI 38 clinical trial and post-marketing experience. Prasugrel is an antiplatelet medication used to prevent thrombotic cardiovascular events, but it carries an increased risk of bleeding as an adverse reaction.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**
In the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, 6741 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were treated with prasugrel (with a loading dose of 60 mg and a daily maintenance dose of 10 mg). Patients were treated for a median of 14.5 months. The study compared prasugrel with clopidogrel, another antiplatelet agent. The rates of bleeding complications were recorded as follows:

- Non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)-related Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Major or Minor bleeding adverse reactions were higher in the prasugrel group (4.5%) compared to the clopidogrel group (3.4%).
- TIMI Major bleeding, a category inclusive of gastrointestinal bleeding, occurred in 2.2% of prasugrel patients versus 1.7% of clopidogrel patients.
- The study highlights an increased risk of GI bleeding related to prasugrel exposure, with 1.5% of patients on prasugrel experiencing a gastrointestinal hemorrhage compared to 1.0% on clopidogrel.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
Post-approval use of prasugrel has identified GI bleeding as an adverse reaction, although the exact frequency is not precisely estimated due to voluntary reporting and an uncertain population size.

**Boxed Warnings and Precautions:**
The labeling for prasugrel includes a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of significant and sometimes fatal bleeding events. It advises caution or against the use of prasugrel in certain populations, such as those with a propensity to bleed or body weight below 60 kg, and it provides specific guidance about the management of bleeding risk in the context of surgery.

**Summary:**
Evidence from the TRITON-TIMI 38 clinical trial and post-marketing reports establishes a relationship between prasugrel usage and an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse effect. These findings are reflected in the drug’s labeling, which includes a Boxed Warning to inform healthcare practitioners and patients about the risk of serious bleeding events associated with its use.","NA

The label clearly states that bleeding, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction for prasugrel, with prasugrel having a higher rate of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding events unrelated to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery compared to clopidogrel. Therefore, there is evidence that GI bleeding is indeed an adverse reaction of prasugrel, specifically noted in section 6.1 of the label. Refuting this established relationship is not supported by the provided drug label information."
gi bleed,prasugrel,,"Evidence from the TRITON-TIMI 38 clinical trial, which compared prasugrel (Effient) to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), indicates that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is indeed an adverse reaction associated with prasugrel. The trial involved 6741 patients treated with prasugrel and found that bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, was the most commonly reported adverse reaction. Specifically, the trial reported higher rates of non-coronary artery bypass graft surgery (non-CABG) related Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Major or Minor bleeding events in patients taking prasugrel compared to those taking clopidogrel (4.5% vs. 3.4% for Major or Minor bleeding, and 2.2% vs. 1.7% for Major bleeding). GI hemorrhage was specifically mentioned in the adverse reactions, with a higher incidence reported in prasugrel-treated patients (1.5%) than in clopidogrel-treated patients (1.0%).

Furthermore, Table 2 of the drug label shows an increased risk of bleeding in patients 75 years or older and in those weighing less than 60 kg, indicating that prasugrel may pose a greater bleeding risk, including GI bleed, in these populations. The higher risk of bleeding was consistent throughout the treatment period, with an initial heightened risk as illustrated in Figure 1 of the drug label, emphasizing the importance of careful consideration before starting prasugrel in certain patient groups, such as those likely to undergo surgery, including urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Post-marketing experience, as described in the drug label, further supports the relationship between prasugrel and an increased risk of bleeding, as adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) have been identified.

In summary, clinical trial evidence from TRITON-TIMI 38 and post-marketing surveillance data included in the prasugrel drug label indicate a causal relationship between prasugrel exposure and GI bleed as an adverse reaction, particularly noting a greater incidence when compared to clopidogrel, and identifying certain populations who might be at higher risk of such bleeding events.",NA
gi bleed,pregabalin,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trial data and post-marketing experience found in the drug label, there is no direct evidence within the provided sections to suggest that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is an established adverse reaction to pregabalin.

The adverse reactions described in the sections provided are related to other systems and conditions, such as angioedema, hypersensitivity reactions, suicidal behavior and ideation, respiratory depression, dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, weight gain, and effects on platelet count and creatinine kinase, among others. Specific gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions mentioned include dry mouth, constipation, and flatulence, but GI bleed is not listed.

Furthermore, in the postmarketing experience section (6.2), which includes adverse reactions identified after the drug has been approved and is in use by a broader population, GI bleed is not indicated as a potential adverse reaction related to pregabalin.

It should be noted that this summary only covers information provided and does not include a comprehensive search of the literature external to what was furnished. If there have been reports of GI bleed associated with pregabalin use in studies or case reports not included in the drug label information, that information is not captured here. Therefore, as of the latest update based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is no known evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed as an adverse reaction and pregabalin exposure.",NA
gi bleed,procarbazine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and procarbazine exposure can be found within the provided drug label sections. Specifically, under the ""Adverse Reactions"" section, it lists several hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects. While a generalized term ""GI bleed"" is not directly mentioned, related adverse reactions such as ""hematemesis"" and ""melena"" are reported. Hematemesis is the vomiting of blood, and melena refers to black, tarry stools, both of which are symptomatic of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Furthermore, the report of ""bleeding tendencies such as petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, and hemoptysis"" under the ""Hematologic"" sub-section suggests that the drug may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding in general, which could potentially include GI bleed as an adverse reaction. 

There is no explicit mention of clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data within the provided sections of the drug label that further detail the incidence rate or the strength of the association between procarbazine and GI bleed. However, the inclusion of related adverse reactions within the drug label implies that there has been some level of observation or report of these symptoms in patients treated with procarbazine.

In summary, while not explicitly stated as ""GI bleed,"" there is evidence from the drug's label that procarbazine has been associated with adverse reactions that include symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as hematemesis and melena. This suggests a potential relationship between procarbazine exposure and GI bleed. Absent are the specifics of the evidence, such as the context of clinical trials or observed incidence rates from post-marketing surveillance, thus a comprehensive risk evaluation would require additional data from these sources.",NA
gi bleed,propoxyphene,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for propoxyphene, evidence does suggest a relationship between propoxyphene exposure and the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This evidence is documented under the ""Gastrointestinal disorder"" subheading within the postmarketing surveillance section, which explicitly lists ""gastrointestinal bleed"" as a reported adverse event.

While the information does not provide specific details such as the incidence rate, clinical context, or the nature of the reports, the inclusion of GI bleeding as an adverse experience indicates that there have been observations of this reaction in patients taking the drug postmarketing. Postmarketing surveillance often involves voluntary reports from healthcare providers, patients, and other sources, and can reveal adverse effects that may not have been fully captured during pre-approval clinical trials due to the typically larger and more diverse patient population exposed to a drug after its market release.

However, it is important to note that postmarketing reports alone do not establish a causal relationship conclusively; they can raise signals that warrant further investigation. Rigorous studies, such as controlled clinical trials or well-designed observational studies, are typically necessary to confirm causality.

The provided label does not mention GI bleeding in the sections for adverse reactions observed in clinical trials or warnings that would signify a known strong link between the drug and this adverse reaction observed prior to its approval. Thus, while there is some evidence from postmarketing surveillance, there seems to be a lack of detailed clinical trial data available in the provided text to quantify the risk or understand the circumstances under which GI bleeding might occur.

In summary, there is some evidence from postmarketing reports that suggest a possible association between propoxyphene use and GI bleeding, but causality is not established, and detailed evidence from controlled pre-marketing clinical studies are not provided. Health professionals should remain vigilant for this potential adverse reaction and consider it when prescribing and monitoring patients using propoxyphene.","NA

Based on the provided drug label sections, gastrointestinal bleed is listed as an adverse experience reported through postmarketing surveillance of propoxyphene. Thus, there is evidence suggesting a relationship between gi bleed and propoxyphene exposure, and no evidence refuting this relationship is provided in the information you have submitted."
gi bleed,quetiapine,,"Based on the extensive information provided from the drug label of quetiapine, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a known adverse reaction from the use of this medication. The sections provided detail the adverse reactions observed and discussed in various sections of the labeling, clinical trial experiences, postmarketing experience, and specific warnings and precautions. However, GI bleed is not listed among them.

The known adverse reactions of quetiapine, according to the label, include metabolic changes, tardive dyskinesia, hypotension, cataracts, seizures, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, potential cognitive and motor impairment, body temperature dysregulation, dysphagia, and anticholinergic effects. Postmarketing reports have identified several other rare but serious conditions, such as cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, yet GI bleed is not mentioned in this context either.

The lack of evidence in the drug label suggests that GI bleed has not been established as a common or well-known adverse effect of quetiapine. However, it is important to note that this does not entirely rule out GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction; it may occur rarely, or individual case reports might exist that have not been included in the broader postmarketing surveillance data or were not found to be statistically significant in clinical trials.

In conclusion, based on the drug label provided, which includes sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and postmarketing surveillance, there is no known evidence supporting a direct relationship between quetiapine use and the development of GI bleed. If such evidence existed, it would be expected to be described in the sections cited or through individual case studies and regulatory agency warnings, which are not indicated in the provided information. As with all drugs, the emergence of new evidence might change this understanding, and healthcare providers should remain vigilant for updates in the medication's safety profile.",NA
gi bleed,quinapril,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for quinapril, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GI bleed) is listed as an adverse event under the gastrointestinal adverse reactions. However, there is no specific incidence rate provided for this adverse event within the clinical trial data summary, which makes it difficult to ascertain the frequency or establish a strong causal relationship solely from this information.

Here are the relevant findings concerning gastrointestinal hemorrhage:

- ""Gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" is mentioned in the section detailing less frequent but clinically significant events seen in clinical trials or post-marketing experience. The listing in italics may indicate that it is a rarer event, but without incidence rates or specific study details, the exact frequency and causality cannot be concluded from the label alone.
 
Since the available sections do not provide detailed data on the incidence or the nature of the GI bleed events observed during the studies or post-marketing surveillance, further investigation into published clinical trials, case studies, or pharmacovigilance databases would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive evaluation and summary of evidence for gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse reaction to quinapril.

Based on the label information alone, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is recognized as a potential adverse reaction to quinapril, but the evidence to support a strong causal relationship is not provided in the label. Additional research would be necessary to obtain a more precise understanding of this relationship. If further information from additional scientific sources were available, it would be important to review that to provide a more thorough summary.",NA
gi bleed,ramucirumab,,"Ramucirumab, marketed as CYRAMZA, is a monoclonal antibody that acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which can inhibit the blood supply to tumors and is used in the treatment of various cancers.

Evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, including serious and fatal events occurring as an adverse reaction to ramucirumab, has been documented:

1. **Clinical Trials Experience**: In the clinical studies referenced in the drug label, which included a total of 2137 patients, hemorrhage was identified as a serious adverse reaction (Section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS). According to the label, the incidence of all-grade hemorrhage ranged from 13% to 55%, with Grade 3-5 hemorrhages (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) being reported from 2% to 5%. Specifically, ramucirumab studies REGARD and RAINBOW provided evidence of GI hemorrhage events with incidences of 16%/8% (all grades/Grade 3-4) and 10%/4% (all grades/Grade 3-4), respectively, when administered either as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel for gastric cancer.

2. **Warnings and Precautions (5.1 Hemorrhage)**: The warnings clarify an increased risk of hemorrhage and recommend discontinuing the drug in the case of severe bleeding. Both gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemorrhage related to GI perforation are mentioned.

3. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Study (REACH-2)**: Gastrointestinal hemorrhage events were documented in patients with HCC, with an incidence reported at 12% for all grades and 2% for Grade ≥ 3.

4. **Postmarketing Experience (6.3)**: The product label notes that, following the approval of CYRAMZA, additional hemorrhagic events have been reported. However, since these are voluntarily reported and from a population of uncertain size, it's more challenging to robustly estimate frequency or establish a direct causal relationship to the drug.

In conclusion, the relationship between GI bleeding and ramucirumab exposure is supported by evidence from clinical trials (REGARD, RAINBOW, and REACH-2), where cases of GI hemorrhage were observed and documented with varying incidences. The risk is also reflected in the product label's warnings and precautions section, which advises healthcare professionals to monitor for hemorrhagic events and consider discontinuation of the drug if severe bleeding occurs. Additional reports from postmarketing surveillance also indicate occurrences of hemorrhage, providing real-world data that aligns with the clinical trial findings.",NA
gi bleed,ramucirumab,,"The drug label for ramucirumab (CYRAMZA) provides substantial evidence supporting the relationship between ramucirumab exposure and the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which includes GI hemorrhage. Ramucirumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antagonist indicated for various cancers.

Evidence from clinical trials:
- In the RAINBOW trial, patients treated with ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel showed an all-grade adverse event rate for GI hemorrhage of 10% and a Grade 3-4 rate of 4.6%. Comparatively, in the placebo with paclitaxel arm, the rate was 6.2% for all grades and 1.2% for Grade 3-4 events (Table 3).

Warnings and Precautions sections of the label:
- Hemorrhage: There is a warning that ramucirumab increases the risk of hemorrhage, including serious GI hemorrhage. Patients with cancer receiving ramucirumab have an incidence of all-grade hemorrhage ranging from 13-55%, and Grade 3-5 hemorrhage between 2-5% across multiple clinical trials (Section 5.1).

- GI Perforations: Ramucirumab can increase the risk of GI perforation, which can be fatal, further indicating the potential for serious GI-related adverse events (Section 5.2).

Postmarketing Experience:
- While not specifically about GI bleeding, post-marketing surveillance does note the identification of blood and lymphatic system adverse reactions such as thrombotic microangiopathy (Section 6.3). This adds additional evidence of hemorrhage risk, though it does not directly specify GI bleeding.

The evidence from clinical trials, warnings, and precautious sections of the label as well as the postmarketing experience collectively provide a clear indication that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of ramucirumab. Clinicians should monitor patients for signs of bleeding and manage according to current clinical guidelines, including potentially discontinuing ramucirumab if a severe bleeding event occurs.",NA
gi bleed,rasagiline,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for rasagiline, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction observed during clinical trials or in the postmarketing experience. GI bleed is not listed in the adverse reactions (Section 6), warnings, or boxed warnings. Here is a summary of the key findings from the label:

**Clinical Trials Experience**:
- Rasagiline, both as monotherapy and adjunct therapy, commonly reported adverse reactions included flu syndrome, arthralgia, depression, dyspepsia, peripheral edema, fall, cough, insomnia, dyskinesia, accidental injury, weight loss, postural hypotension, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, rash, abnormal dreams, and tenosynovitis.
- No significant differences in safety profiles were noted based on age or gender.
- Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment included hallucinations, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, weight loss, and rash.

**Postmarketing Experience**:
- The label mentions skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (e.g., melanoma) identified in postmarketing surveillance but does not explicitly list GI bleeding.

**Warnings and Precautions**:
- Sections 5.1 to 5.10 discuss risks associated with blood pressure, serotonin syndrome, sleep episodes, orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations/psychotic-like behavior, impulse control/compulsive behaviors, and withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion.
- While there's a detailed discussion of potential cardiovascular events (such as hypertension and orthostatic hypotension), there's no specific warning or precaution listed for GI bleeding.

In conclusion, the provided sections of the rasagiline label do not provide evidence to support GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to the drug based on clinical trial data or post-marketing surveillance experience. However, absence of evidence in the label does not conclusively rule out the potential for this adverse event. It may occur less frequently or have been reported after the knowledge cutoff for the label content. For the most current information and for healthcare decisions, healthcare professionals should consult the most recent medical literature, safety databases, and respective health authorities' advisories.","NA
"
gi bleed,rezafungin,,"The provided drug label sections describe the safety profile of Rezafungin, marketed under the name REZZAYO, which is an antifungal medication used in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. However, within the cited information, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is not explicitly listed as a common or less common adverse reaction in the clinical trial data presented for rezafungin.

The most frequent adverse reactions (with an incidence of ≥ 5%) relate to gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and constipation, metabolic and nutrition disorders like hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, general disorders including pyrexia, and blood and lymphatic system disorders such as anemia. Less common adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions, tremor, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dysphagia, and others; however, GI bleeding is specifically categorized under gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients.

Adverse events leading to the discontinuation of the study medication were comparable between the rezafungin arm (9.3%) and caspofungin arm (9.0%). The label mentions gastrointestinal hemorrhage among selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than 5% of patients, which might involve GI bleeding, but it is not a prominent or common adverse effect of the drug according to the presented data.

Considering the provided contents of the drug label, it can be deduced that while there is a potential noted occurrence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, there isn't strong evidence directly linking rezafungin with GI bleed as a significant or common adverse reaction based on the clinical trials data summarized in the label. This adverse reaction is listed as occurring in less than 5% of patients, indicating that it is not one of the main reactions observed during the trials.

If additional post-marketing surveillance data or further studies become available, they would be necessary to establish a more definitive relationship between rezafungin and GI bleed, especially since post-marketing surveillance can sometimes reveal adverse reactions that were not detected during clinical trials due to the larger and more diverse patient population. As of the information provided, there is limited evidence to suggest a strong association between rezafungin and GI bleed. For thorough investigation and risk assessment, clinicians should consult the most updated resources and drug databases.","The information provided from the drug label regarding rezafungin does not report gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as either a common or infrequent adverse reaction observed in clinical trials. GI-related adverse reactions that were noted as common (incidence ≥ 5%) include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. Additionally, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as a less common adverse reaction (occurred in <5% of patients).

However, based on the presented drug label sections, there is no specific evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and rezafungin usage, just an absence of reported GI bleed as an adverse reaction during the clinical trials mentioned. This absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence. 

To categorically refute a relationship would require targeted research evaluating the incidence of GI bleed in patients exposed to rezafungin compared to an appropriate control group. Since this detailed analysis is not provided, one cannot conclusively state that there is evidence refuting the relationship, but it can be noted that GI bleed was not identified as a significant adverse reaction in the available clinical trial data for rezafungi."
gi bleed,ribavirin,,"The provided drug label information for Ribavirin for Inhalation Solution, USP, does not explicitly mention gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. The adverse reactions section of the drug label principally lists pulmonary-related events such as worsening of respiratory status, bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema, as well as other conditions like deaths (in some cases ""possibly related"" to drug use), cardiovascular events, hematologic effects like anemia and hemolytic anemia, and other miscellaneous effects including rash and conjunctivitis.

GI bleed is not among the various serious adverse events characterized in severely ill infants or the hematologic anomalies (mainly anemia) identified in most infants treated. Adverse events in health care workers also did not include GI bleed among the reported symptoms.

Given that GI bleed is not mentioned in any adverse reactions, warnings, or box warnings sections of the Ribavirin label information provided, and no specific studies or data are presented, I can state that based on the evidence provided, there is no known evidence to support a relationship between GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction to Ribavirin exposure. However, the absence of such evidence within the provided drug label information does not completely rule out the possibility. Further investigation into more comprehensive databases of clinical trials, case reports, and post-marketing surveillance might be needed to conclusively determine if a relationship has been observed in other studies or patient reports not encapsulated in the drug label.",NA
gi bleed,rilonacept,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for rilonacept (ARCALYST), there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials. The adverse reactions highlighted include injection-site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and changes in lipid profiles. Notably, one patient during the CAPS clinical program experienced a serious infection that included gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis; however, this instance is described as a component of a serious infection rather than as an isolated adverse reaction.

Serious Infections are mentioned under Warnings and Precautions, where treatment with ARCALYST has been associated with serious infections. Under Adverse Reactions (6.1), a serious infection involving Mycobacterium intracellulare included gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis. Additionally, the drug label advises healthcare professionals to avoid initiating treatment with ARCALYST in patients with active or chronic infections and to discontinue treatment if a patient develops a serious infection.

While this isolated report may suggest a possible association between ARCALYST and GI bleeding, it arises within the context of a severe infection rather than as an independent adverse reaction. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no substantial evidence to conclusively support a direct relationship between GI bleeding and ARCALYST usage. Furthermore, since the drug label represents a synthesis of data from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, it is reasonable to conclude that GI bleed is not a common or well-characterized adverse reaction of rilonacept. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor for adverse effects based on individual patient risk factors and to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate monitoring systems.",NA
gi bleed,rilonacept,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence indicating gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a commonly reported adverse reaction of rilonacept (ARCALYST). However, the label does mention a serious adverse event involving gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis reported in one patient during the Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) clinical program. This patient was involved in the CAPS clinical studies and had a serious infection involving Mycobacterium intracellulare, gastrointestinal bleeding, and colitis.

It is important to note that this case alone does not establish a direct and systematic relationship between rilonacept use and GI bleeding since it is mentioned alongside other serious conditions. Additionally, the incidence of this event is not provided in relation to the total number of patients exposed to the drug, making it difficult to evaluate the event's frequency and significance. Moreover, the label does not mention GI bleed as a typical adverse reaction.

Therefore, while there has been a report of GI bleeding in one patient during the clinical trial program for CAPS, there is insufficient evidence in the provided label to establish a firm causal relationship between rilonacept and GI bleeding as a typical adverse reaction. Further investigation, such as additional case studies or post-marketing surveillance, would be needed to draw more definitive conclusions about the potential association between rilonacept and the risk of GI bleed. Additionally, monitoring for GI symptoms in patients taking rilonacept, especially those with other risk factors for GI bleeding, may be advisable.",NA
gi bleed,ritonavir,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, is reported as one of the adverse reactions in the clinical trial experience for ritonavir. Specifically, GI hemorrhage was reported in 41 patients, corresponding to 2.3% of the 1,755 adult patients receiving ritonavir in combined Phase II/IV studies as indicated in Table 2 under the subsection ""Gastrointestinal disorders.""

The clinical trial evidence is supported by postmarketing surveillance, although GI bleed is not specifically mentioned. Adverse events reported during postmarketing surveillance are usually listed if they add new information on potential side effects not fully captured during clinical trials. The GI-related issues reported in the postmarketing experience are dehydration, associated gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension, syncope, or renal insufficiency, which could involve GI bleeding as an underlying factor or a concomitant event.

To clarify, the incidence rate and the causal relationship between ritonavir use and GI bleed specifically cannot be firmly established from postmarketing data because these reported reactions are voluntary with unknown incidence rates and are confounded by underlying disease, concurrent medications, and other factors. However, the relationship between ritonavir use and GI bleed is mentioned in the context of clinical trial experiences, denoting that this potential adverse reaction has been observed and reported in more than 1% of the patients in the studies cited.

In conclusion, while there may not be a detailed breakdown of the pathophysiology of ritonavir-induced GI bleed or data quantifying the relative risk of this particular adverse event, the evidence from clinical trials indicated in the drug label suggests that there is an association between ritonavir use and gastrointestinal bleeding. Health care providers should monitor patients on ritonavir for signs and symptoms of GI bleed and manage as clinically appropriate.","NA

The provided drug label sections on adverse reactions, warnings, and box warnings for ritonavir do not list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an observed adverse reaction. This suggests that there is no established evidence in these reports directly refuting or supporting the relationship between GI bleed and ritonavir exposure. However, without specific clinical studies or case reports investigating the absence of a relationship, the lack of mention in these sections does not categorically rule out the possibility. If GI bleed were a common or well-documented adverse effect, it would likely be included in these sections, but the absence of such documentation can also be due to underreporting or lack of evidence linking this outcome directly to ritonavir."
gi bleed,rivaroxaban,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is documented in several sections of the drug's label based on clinical trials and post-marketing experiences.

**Clinical Trials Evidence:**

1. **ROCKET AF Trial:** Particularly notable is the ROCKET AF trial, which is a pivotal phase III study comparing rivaroxaban to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Table 5 from the drug label indicates that GI bleeding events (which included upper GI, lower GI, and rectal bleeding) were more frequent in patients treated with rivaroxaban than with warfarin, with an incidence rate of 2.0% for rivaroxaban compared to 1.2% for warfarin (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.30-1.99).

2. **EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE Studies:** These studies pooled analysis reflects a comparison between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin/Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). Major bleeding events were reported with an incidence rate of 1.0% for rivaroxaban compared to 1.7% for enoxaparin/VKA.

3. **EINSTEIN CHOICE Study:** This study compared different doses of rivaroxaban and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Major bleeding was higher in the group receiving the 20 mg dose of rivaroxaban.

4. **RECORD Clinical Trials:** These trials evaluated prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery. They reported major bleeding events and any bleeding events, with major bleeding event rates being 0.3% in the Xarelto group for patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgeries.

5. **COMPASS Trial:** In patients with coronary artery disease, major GI bleeding occurred more frequently in patients treated with a lower dose of rivaroxaban versus placebo (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.7, 3.4).

**Post-marketing Surveillance:**

The drug's label also reports on post-marketing experience, where GI bleeding is an identified adverse reaction to rivaroxaban based on voluntary reports. Such surveillance supports the notion that GI bleeding is a recognized reaction post-marketing, though the label notes it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure due to the reporting mechanism.

In summary, evidence from large clinical trials and post-marking surveillance data substantiates the association between GI bleeding and the use of rivaroxaban. It is important to consider this risk when prescribing rivaroxaban, especially in patients with additional factors that may increase the risk of bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,rivaroxaban,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) primarily comes from clinical trials and post-marketing experience as documented in the drug label. Here is a concise summary:

1. Clinical Trials:
   - In the ROCKET AF trial, gastrointestinal bleeding events included upper, lower GI, and rectal bleeding. It was observed that GI bleeding occurred in 221 out of 7111 patients treated with rivaroxaban (2.0% per year) compared to 140 out of 7125 patients on warfarin (1.2% per year), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.99), indicating a higher incidence with rivaroxaban.
   - The EINSTEIN DVT and PE studies showed that major GI bleeding occurred in 40 (1.0%) patients on rivaroxaban compared to 72 (1.7%) patients on enoxaparin/Vitamin K antagonist (VKA).
   - Other major trials, such as the EINSTEIN CHOICE and COMPASS trials, also documented an increased risk of major GI bleeding in patients treated with rivaroxaban.

2. Postmarketing Experience:
   - Post-approval, GI bleed has been identified as an adverse reaction during the use of rivaroxaban. However, because post-marketing reports are voluntary and the population size is uncertain, the precise frequency and causal relationship cannot be established definitively.

3. Boxed Warnings:
   - While not specific to GI bleeding, the boxed warnings emphasize the serious risk of bleeding associated with the use of rivaroxaban and the availability of a reversal agent for rivaroxaban's anti-factor Xa activity.

4. Warnings and Precautions:
   - The drug label advises that rivaroxaban increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding events, including GI bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding should be carefully weighed against the benefits of anticoagulation.

In summary, clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance indicate that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of rivaroxaban. The risk of GI bleed appears to be higher with rivaroxaban compared to some other anticoagulants, notably warfarin, in specific clinical situations. These findings are reflected in the drug's warnings and precautions, informing the management of patients who are prescribed rivaroxaban.",NA
gi bleed,rivastigmine,,"Based on the drug label information provided, it does not explicitly list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an observed adverse reaction in controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine tartrate. However, the label does mention peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding under the section ""Other Adverse Reactions from Increased Cholinergic Activity,"" stating that ""Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity."" The label also advises monitoring for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in those at increased risk (e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

While the label notes that clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, it suggests there is a theoretical risk of GI bleeding based on the pharmacological action of the drug, which can increase gastric acidity and thus potentially predispose patients to gastrointestinal mucosal damage.

In conclusion, while explicit evidence from clinical trials linking rivastigmine to GI bleeding as a common adverse event is not provided in the label, there is a recognized potential risk for this adverse event based on the drug's pharmacologic profile and its effect on gastric acid secretion. Patients using rivastigmine should be monitored for gastrointestinal symptoms, and increased attention may be required for patients with risk factors for GI bleeding. It is also important to report any suspected adverse reactions to healthcare providers or through channels like the FDA’s MedWatch for further investigation and post-marketing surveillance.",NA
gi bleed,ropinirole,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for ropinirole, there is no mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial experience or the postmarketing experience. The most common adverse reactions reported from clinical trials that relate to gastrointestinal issues with ropinirole include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, and dysphagia. These are mentioned as treatment-emergent adverse reactions in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa), advanced Parkinson’s disease (with L-dopa), and patients with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) when compared to a placebo.

To summarize, there is no evidence listed in the provided sections of the drug label to support a relationship between ropinirole and GI bleed as an adverse reaction. This includes the absence of such a mention in the adverse reactions, clinical trials experience, or in the postmarketing experience. If there were reports or associations of ropinirole with GI bleed, it would be advisable to consult the most current medical literature, clinical trial databases, or post-marketing surveillance data to determine if any new evidence has emerged. However, based on the information provided, no known evidence supports this relationship.",NA
gi bleed,sapropterin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for sapropterin, there is explicit evidence indicating gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions, including esophagitis and gastritis, associated with the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets. Serious adverse reactions, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, have been reported in patients receiving sapropterin dihydrochloride in both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. These findings are mentioned in the 'Warnings and Precautions' (section 5.2) and 'Adverse Reactions' (section 6.2) of the drug label. It should be noted that GI adverse reactions can result in severe complications if left untreated, including bleeding. 

Specifically, the drug label under 'Safety Experience from Clinical Studies for Non-PKU Indications' states that, among approximately 800 subjects in various clinical trials using a different formulation of the same active ingredient, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported as a serious and severe reaction. Additionally, the 'Postmarketing Experience' section lists gastrointestinal reactions including gastritis, which may encompass or indicate instances of GI bleed.

However, the term ""GI bleed"" is not specifically mentioned in the sections provided. It is important to interpret GI bleeding as a broader category that could potentially include gastrointestinal bleeding of various severity, including, but not necessarily limited to, a GI bleed.

In conclusion, while there is documented evidence of serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal bleeding, with sapropterin dihydrochloride use, the evidence does not explicitly mention ""GI bleed"" as a term. Therefore, GI bleeding can be considered a related adverse reaction under the umbrella of reported GI issues associated with sapropterin dihydrochloride, and health care professionals should monitor patients for signs and symptoms accordingly.",NA
gi bleed,saquinavir,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for saquinavir (Invirase), there is evidence that gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, is an adverse event that has been observed in clinical trials. This information is listed under additional adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with saquinavir in the label section ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS."" However, it is important to note that the association between GI bleed and saquinavir use is not highlighted in either the ""warnings"" or ""boxed warnings"" sections, indicating that it may not be one of the most common or severe adverse reactions associated with saquinavir.

Regarding sources of evidence:

1. Clinical Trial Experience (Section 6.1): This section refers to the adverse reactions observed in clinical trials with adult subjects who were administered saquinavir, either alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs like zidovudine (ZDV), zalcitabine (ddC), or ritonavir. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, pneumonia, lipodystrophy, and abdominal pain. It does not explicitly mention GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction.

2. Additional Adverse Reactions Reported During Clinical Trials (Section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS): Gastrointestinal disorders are listed, which includes gastrointestinal hemorrhage among other GI-related events. This suggests that GI bleed has been observed in clinical trials, but the label does not provide specific data on incidence rates, severity, or causality.

3. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.3): This section includes adverse events identified during postmarketing use that are similar to those observed in clinical trials. Again, the label mentions gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but it does not provide incidence rates or establish a clear causal relationship to saquinavir exposure.

In summary, according to the drug label, GI bleeding has been documented as an adverse reaction in clinical trials involving saquinavity but the available information from the label does not detail the frequency or conclusively establish causality. If more detailed investigation is warranted, it would be important to consult individual clinical trial results, case studies, and more comprehensive postmarketing surveillance data.",NA
gi bleed,sargramostim,,"The provided drug label for sargramostim (brand name LEUKINE) does not directly list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction or in the boxed warnings. Upon reviewing the evidence presented in the clinical trial data provided in the label, GI bleed is mentioned within the context of post-transplant treatment: specifically, 27% of patients treated with LEUKINE following autologous bone marrow transplantation or peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation experienced GI hemorrhage (Table 1 of Section 6.1). The incidence of this adverse event was not directly compared to placebo in the summary provided, making it difficult to discern the drug’s specific contribution to this risk.

Additional evidence from other clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance particularly focusing on GI bleed as an adverse reaction to sargramostim is not given in the provided label text.

In summary, the evidence linking GI bleed as an adverse reaction to sargramostim is limited to an observed incidence in a clinical trial context (27% as per the drug label). However, without comparative placebo data and additional studies or surveillance reports, the strength of the evidence is limited. It is essential for healthcare providers to consider this potential risk among others and to monitor patients for signs of GI bleeding, especially in settings where the drug is administered post-transplant, as the drug label does suggest an elevated incidence in this context. 

For concrete assessments, further detailed investigation into trial data and vigilant post-marketing surveillance would be required to establish a more precise causal relationship between sargramostim treatment and the risk of GI bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,selegiline,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label for selegiline, gastrointestinal bleeding is mentioned as an adverse reaction that may exacerbate preexisting ulcer disease. This can be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, in patients using the drug. However, the label specifies that this adverse event occurred at doses greater than 10 mg/day, which suggests a possible dose-response relationship — higher doses may carry a greater risk of such side effects.

The evidence concerning GI bleed as an adverse reaction to selegiline comes from the following sources mentioned in the drug label:

1. **Clinical Trials**: In the placebo-controlled clinical trial data provided, gastrointestinal bleeding was not listed among the treatment-emergent adverse experiences that differed meaningfully in frequency between the selegiline and placebo groups. Nonetheless, GI bleed is specified as an adverse event under the gastrointestinal category, occurring specifically at higher doses.

2. **Case Studies and Post-Marketing Surveillance**: The drug label mentions GI bleed in the context of an exacerbation of pre-existing ulcer disease. While specific post-marketing reports are not detailed in the text excerpt provided, it is implied that gastrointestinal bleeding might have been observed in patients post-marketing, but causal relationships could not be established.

It is necessary to note that the drug label explicitly states that the information available from literature reports and foreign post-marketing reports does not provide the kind of detailed information needed to estimate the incidence of adverse events reliably.

In summary, while the drug label does mention gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential adverse event at higher doses of selegiline, especially in the context of pre-existing ulcer disease, there is no clear causal relationship established between standard doses of selegiline and GI bleeding. More detailed evidence from large-scale studies or databases would be needed to confirm such a relationship definitively.

For healthcare providers and patients, this information suggests a need for caution when prescribing or using selegiline, particularly at higher doses or in individuals with a history of ulcer disease or other risk factors for GI bleeding. Careful monitoring for GI symptoms in such contexts would be prudent.",NA
gi bleed,selpercatinib,,"Based on the provided drug label information for selpercatinib (RETEVMO), hemorrhagic events were identified as an adverse reaction in patients treated with this drug. Specifically, the section detailing adverse reactions (Section 6.1) reports that serious hemorrhagic events occurred in 9% of patients, with Grade ≥3 hemorrhagic events noted in 3.1% of patients. Fatal adverse reactions included hemorrhage in 4 (0.5%) patients, indicating a link between selpercatinib and serious hemorrhagic adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Hemorrhagic events were comprehensive and included various types of bleeding such as epistaxis, contusion, hematuria as well as more serious bleeding such as cerebral, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is specifically mentioned in the adverse reactions table under the ""Hemorrhage"" category, and these events spanned across the Grades 1-4 severity.

Permanent discontinuation of selpercatinib due to severe or life-threatening hemorrhage is recommended (Section 5.5). Although gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as a specific type of bleeding is not explicitly mentioned in the boxed warnings, warnings, or adverse reactions sections, it can be considered under the category of hemorrhagic events, which is broadly defined and includes gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Clinical trials experience in LIBRETTO-001, a pooled safety population analysis that included 796 patients, showed that selpercatinib can cause severe hemorrhagic events, with fatal outcomes in some cases. While not every hemorrhagic event can be classified as a GI bleed, the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the reported data implies that GI bleed is indeed an adverse reaction related to selpercatinib use. However, the available information does not detail the frequency of GI bleeds specifically versus other types of hemorrhagic events.

To conclude, the evidence from clinical trial data indicates a relationship between selpercatinib treatment and the risk of hemorrhagic events, including GI bleeding. Careful monitoring and appropriate clinical management are recommended to mitigate these risks. Health care professionals and patients are advised to report any suspected adverse reactions to the appropriate authorities for ongoing pharmacovigilance.",NA
gi bleed,sevelamer,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and sevelamer exposure comes from post-marketing surveillance data, as documented in the drug’s labeling, and includes bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers among the adverse reactions identified after approval (section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience). In this data, cases such as bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers are described as being voluntarily reported from a post-approval use population. While the exact frequency or direct causality to drug exposure cannot always be robustly established due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the uncertain size of the reporting population, the reports are taken into consideration because they suggest a possible association.

Furthermore, section 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and specifically subsection 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events highlight serious cases of GI complications including bleeding GI ulcers which have been associated with sevelamer use, with some cases requiring hospitalization and surgery. The section emphasizes the serious nature of these GI adverse reactions and their association with the use of the drug.

It is worth noting that typical adverse reactions observed in clinical trials with sevelamer (section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) include various gastrointestinal discomforts such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, flatulence, and constipation. Although GI bleed is not explicitly listed among the common adverse events observed in clinical trials, the range of GI side effects reported and later, more serious complications reported post-marketing, suggests a potential for GI bleeding as a rarer but severe adverse event.

The label also includes information that inflammatory disorders may resolve upon discontinuation of sevelamer carbonate tablets and advises that treatment with the drug should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms.

In summary, while gastrointestinal bleeding is not among the most commonly reported adverse events in clinical trials for sevelamer, there is evidence from post-marketing surveillance that suggests an association between sevelamer use and serious GI complications, including bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers. This information should be taken into account by healthcare professionals when evaluating the risks and benefits of sevelamer treatment for individual patients.",NA
gi bleed,sulindac,1.0,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as an adverse reaction and exposure to sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can be derived from multiple sources as mentioned in the drug label, predominantly from clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance reports.

1. **Clinical Trials Evidence:**
   - Adverse reactions related to sulindac have been documented in clinical trials that encompassed observations in 1,865 patients, including 232 monitored for at least 48 weeks.
   - Though not specified to be greater than 1%, gastrointestinal disturbances are significant enough to be noted in these trials, with adverse effects including GI pain, dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and anorexia. More severe GI adverse reactions were observed with an incidence of less than 1 in 100 patients but are explicitly reported as: peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding, GI perforation, and intestinal strictures.

2. **Post-marketing Surveillance:**
   - After sulindac was marketed, additional gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported. This implies that further evidence of GI bleeds associated with sulindac emerged beyond the context of controlled clinical trials and includes cases observed in a broader patient population under less controlled conditions.
   - Such reporting indicates that practitioners and patients have observed and attributed GI bleeding episodes to sulindac use during real-world clinical practice.

3. **Label Warnings:**
   - The drug label includes clear warnings regarding the increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, which include bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, potentially resulting in fatal outcomes.
   - The warnings emphasize that these serious GI events can happen at any time during the use of the drug and can manifest without prior symptoms.

4. **Boxed Warning:**
   - Sulindac, like other NSAIDs, carries a boxed warning highlighting the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events as well as the risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, such as GI bleeding, which supports the established relationship between NSAID use and increased risk of GI hemorrhage.

Based on the aforementioned points, there is a body of evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences, which supports a causal relationship between GI bleeding and the use of sulindac. Additionally, the drug label contains explicit warnings and precautions about the increased risk of GI adverse events, including bleeding, which are necessary to inform healthcare providers and patients of the potential risks associated with the drug's use.","Based on the provided sections of the drug label for sulindac, there is a reported association between the use of sulindac and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions, including GI bleed. The label explicitly states that ""Peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported"" under the section of adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1 in 100. Furthermore, the ""Gastrointestinal Risk"" section of the warnings indicates that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including sulindac, ""cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal.""

Given this information directly from the drug's labeling, which reflects data from clinical trials, case studies, and post-marketing surveillance, there is evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed and sulindac exposure, rather than refuting it. As a result, in this context, it is not applicable (NA) to provide evidence refuting the relationship between GI bleed and sulindac exposure because the evidence from the drug label supports the existence of such a relationship."
gi bleed,sumatriptan,,"The provided drug label sections concerning the drug sumatriptan (marketed as IMITREX) do not explicitly mention gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction observed in clinical trials, post-marketing experience, or specifically addressed under warnings and precautions. Adverse reactions that are discussed in detail in the prescribing information include myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, cerebrovascular events, other vasospasm reactions, medication overuse headache, serotonin syndrome, increases in blood pressure, hypersensitivity reactions, and seizures.

The most common adverse reactions observed at a frequency of ≥2% and greater than placebo were paresthesia, sensations of warmth/cold, chest pain/tightness/pressure, neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, other sensations of pressure/tightness/heaviness, vertigo, and malaise/fatigue. Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions are cited as a condition that should lead to discontinuation of sumatriptan, which suggests that ischemic events leading to conditions like GI bleed could theoretically occur within the context of a broader set of vasospasm reactions; however, a specific causal link to GI bleed is not delineated in the given sections of the label.

In the post-marketing experience section, adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain sizes, such as hypotension, palpitations, dystonia, and tremor, but no mention of GI bleed is made. It's important to note that post-marketing surveillance may not capture all adverse events due to underreporting or miscategorization.

Given the information provided, there is no explicit evidence supporting a relationship between sumatriptan exposure and the occurrence of a GI bleed in the available clinical trial data, warnings, or post-marketing surveillance as included in the prescribing information. To make a definitive statement about this potential adverse reaction, further investigation would be required, such as a review of broader pharmacovigilance databases, published case reports, or additional sources of scientific literature that go beyond the provided label sections. If such data were available, a more comprehensive assessment could be made. As of now, based on the labeling information given, there is no known evidence to establish a direct link between sumatriptan use and GI bleed as an adverse reaction.",NA
gi bleed,sunitinib,,"The provided drug label sections for sunitinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) indicate gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a potential adverse event. Specifically, based on the warning and precautions section (5.5 Hemorrhagic Events and Viscus Perforation) of the drug label, hemorrhagic events, some of which were fatal and include gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement, have been observed. The pooled safety population indicated that 30% of patients experienced some form of hemorrhagic event, with GI hemorrhage being a significant Grade 3-5 event. Notably, GI bleeds or hemorrhages are a serious adverse event associated with sunitinib therapy.

Evidence from clinical trials supports the relationship between sunitinib exposure and GI bleeding. For instance, in the provided clinical trial data (e.g., Tables 5 and 6 discussing adverse events in patients with renal cell carcinoma), bleeding events at all sites were reported in 37% of patients on sunitinib, including a case of Grade 5 gastric hemorrhage which is potentially indicative of a severe GI bleed.

Post-marketing surveillance (Section 6.2) supplements the clinical trial data, offering additional real-world evidence of the adverse reactions identified after the drug's approval. Significantly, it enumerates GI disorders as observed adverse reactions, further implicating sunitinib exposure in the incidence of GI bleeding, although specific references to GI bleed post-marketing are not provided in the text.

Given the clinical trial incidences of hemorrhagic events and the labeling which specifically includes hemorrhage as a warning, there is substantial evidence for a relationship between sunitinib use and the potential for adverse reactions including GI bleeding. This relationship is further supported by post-marketing surveillance that captures a wider range of patient experiences and real-world data. It is important to continue monitoring the safety profile of sunitinib through ongoing pharmacovigilance activities.",NA
gi bleed,temsirolimus,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for Temsirolimus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, is mentioned as a less frequently reported adverse reaction (observed in less than 10% of patients) during clinical trials. Specifically, the ""Gastrointestinal Disorders"" subsection under ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience"" states that gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 1% of patients and rectal hemorrhage in another 1% of patients who received 25 mg IV Temsirolimus injection in a randomized trial.

No additional information is provided about the severity, timing, or details of these outcomes in relation to the administration of Temsirolimus within the provided text. Moreover, the label does not explicitly include GI bleed as a part of warnings or precautions or in the most common adverse reactions. However, bowel perforation, which could potentially lead to GI bleeding, is discussed in the warnings and precautions section (5.7 Bowel Perforation), indicating the importance of evaluating patients who present with relevant symptoms such as abdominal pain or bloody stools.

Regarding post-marketing experience (section 6.2), while there is no explicit mention of GI bleed, ongoing surveillance can often identify less frequent adverse reactions that are not as apparent in clinical trial settings.

To concisely summarize, GI bleed is indeed mentioned as a potential adverse reaction to Temsirolimus in clinical trial data, albeit at a low frequency (1%). It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of this possible risk when prescribing Temsirolimus, and patients receiving the drug should be monitored for symptoms of GI bleed, particularly if they present with risk factors or concurrent medications that may increase their risk.

For healthcare providers and decision-makers, it's essential to consider this information within the broader context of the individual patient's condition, risk factors, and potential benefits of Temsirolimus treatment. It would be prudent to stay updated with the latest safety data and peer-reviewed literature to ensure comprehensive patient care.",NA
gi bleed,testosterone,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label, there is no direct evidence presented that explicitly lists gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction associated with testosterone gel, 1% use in either clinical trial experience (6.1), post-marketing experience (6.2), or within the warnings and precaution sections (5).

The adverse reactions observed in clinical trials and listed in the label include acne, application site reactions, abnormal lab tests, and prostatic disorders, among others detailed in the clinical trials (e.g., emotional lability, hypertension, gynecomastia). Specific serious adverse events, such as deep vein thrombosis and prostate disorder requiring surgery, were also noted in a 3-year flexible dose extension study. Additionally, increases in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were observed and are pertinent for monitoring prostate health (6.1).

The post-marketing experience section (6.2) lists a variety of adverse reactions identified through voluntary reports, including cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke), but does not mention GI bleed as a known side effect. Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that adverse events reported post-marketing are not always fully verified in terms of causality due to external factors and reporting biases.

Given the available information and the focus on hematocrit and the potential risk for thromboembolic events in sections 5.3 and 5.4, there may be an inferred risk for individuals who may be prone to bleeding due to underlying conditions. However, this inference does not equate to direct evidence of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to testosterone gel.

In conclusion, within the provided drug label sections for testosterone gel, 1%, there is no stated evidence supporting a direct relationship between testosterone exposure and GI bleed as an adverse reaction. It is possible that isolated cases can still occur or be reported, but such evidence would need to be identified in individual case studies or reported through post-marketing surveillance databases and then duly investigated to establish a causal link.",NA
gi bleed,thalidomide,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for thalidomide, specifically the ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS"" section and the ""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS,"" gastrointestinal bleeding, such as a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, is not explicitly listed as a known adverse reaction from thalidomide clinical trials or post-marketing experience. Adverse reactions that are closely related and reported include gastrointestinal disorders like constipation and dry mouth, but these are not equivalent to a GI bleed.

However, mention of gastrointestinal disorders, such as ""gastrointestinal perforations"" and ""stomach ulcer,"" is noted in the ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience"" section. These conditions can potentially lead to or present with GI bleeding, although the term ""GI bleed"" is not used directly. The evidence supporting these adverse effects comes from post-marketing surveillance data, which are instances reported by healthcare professionals and consumers after the drug has been approved and released on the market. Since these are voluntary reports, they do not always provide a clear or reliable estimate of frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure without further investigation.

In summary, while GI bleed is not specifically mentioned as an adverse reaction of thalidomide in the clinical trials, there are reports of related gastrointestinal issues like perforations and ulcers in the post-marketing experience that might present with a GI bleed. Thus, while there could be a potential association, the evidence does not conclusively establish GI bleed as a standard adverse reaction to thalidomide.

If further evidence from clinical trials, case studies, or systematic reviews becomes available in the future, it will be essential to reassess this potential relationship with updated information. For now, healthcare professionals should monitor patients on thalidomide for any signs of gastrointestinal disturbances that could suggest a GI bleed, particularly since the drug carries warnings for severe cutaneous reactions and has known risks of other adverse events.",NA
gi bleed,theophylline,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, gastrointestinal bleeding (gi bleed) is not listed among the common adverse reactions observed with therapeutic serum theophylline concentrations (< 20 mcg/mL). The reported adverse effects at these concentrations include nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, agitation, diarrhea, dizziness, fine skeletal muscle tremors, and other symptoms.

However, when examining the information on theophylline toxicity, which occurs at serum concentrations > 30 mcg/mL, the data from clinical toxicity studies (Shanon, Ann Intern Med 1993;119:1161-67 and Sessler, Am J Med 1990;88:567-76) demonstrate an array of adverse reactions, which includes vomiting and gastrointestinal distress. Notably, in these toxicity studies, hematemesis (vomiting of blood, which can be a result of a gi bleed) was reported, although it appears to be a rare event (reported in 0% of patients in Study #1 and only 2% in Study #2 following chronic overdosage).

It's important to differentiate between common and mild adverse reactions associated with therapeutic theophylline use and those adverse effects occurring from toxic overdose levels. The evidence from clinical toxicity studies implies that gi bleed may be associated with high serum theophylline concentrations encountered in overdose situations rather than with therapeutic use.

In conclusion, there is no explicit evidence from the provided drug label sections indicating that gastrointestinal bleeding is a common adverse reaction of theophylline at therapeutic levels. However, rare instances of gi bleeding (specifically, hematemesis) have been reported in cases of theophylline toxicity due to serum concentrations significantly exceeding the therapeutic range. These findings suggest the relationship between gi bleeding and theophylline exposure may be associated with toxic, supratherapeutic serum concentrations.",NA
gi bleed,thiotepa,,"Based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction in the sections describing the adverse reactions and warnings for thiotepa. Thiotepa is an alkylating chemotherapy agent known for its use in the treatment of various cancers and as conditioning treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. The drug label does detail a range of potential adverse reactions and warnings, which include:

1. Hematological toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) is a major concern with thiotepa use, potentially leading to infection or bleeding as a consequence of severe myelosuppression.
2. It lists common gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and mucositis. However, gastrointestinal bleeding or GI bleed is not explicitly mentioned in either the clinical trials experience (section 6.1) or the post-marketing experience (section 6.2).

Post-marketing surveillance does report various gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., ascites, dysphagia, enterocolitis, gastritis, palatal disorder), but none include GI bleed specifically. 

It's important to note that hemorrhage is listed among the common adverse reactions (greater than 10% incidence), but it is not specifically attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemorrhage could potentially occur in various forms and at different sites, and without the term ""GI bleed"" being explicitly mentioned, we cannot conclusively link thiotepa to this specific adverse event.

To adequately conclude whether GI bleed is a known adverse reaction to thiotepa, further investigation into relevant clinical trial data, case reports, and post-marketing records would be necessary. If this information were available, it might provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between thiotepa and GI bleeding events. However, based on the current drug label information provided here, GI bleed is not identified as a recognized adverse reaction to thiotepa.",NA
gi bleed,tiagabine,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for tiagabine HCl (Gabitril), which include adverse reactions, warnings, and post-marketing reports, there is no specific mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction to tiagabine. The sections presented contain comprehensive lists of adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, but GI bleed is not among them.

Although some digestive system-related adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are reported, gastrointestinal hemorrhage is mentioned as infrequent in the context of all clinical trials, it is not highlighted as a specifically known adverse reaction to tiagabine in the summarized sections on adverse reactions, warnings, or boxed warnings.

The post-marketing reports section also does not list GI bleed as an identified adverse reaction during postapproval use of tiagabine HCl.

In conclusion, based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence to suggest that GI bleed is a recognized adverse reaction of tiagabine. Clinical data and post-marketing surveillance have not indicated a clear causative link between tiagabine exposure and GI bleed as an adverse event. It is important to consult medical literature for any newly identified adverse reactions and to report any suspected adverse reactions to health authorities for further evaluation.",NA
gi bleed,ticlopidine,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and ticlopidine exposure is suggested by the safety information provided in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data.

From the provided drug label sections:

1. **Clinical Trials Data:**
  - The adverse reaction sections indicate that gastrointestinal complaints were relatively common in stroke patients taking ticlopidine. Between 30% to 40% of patients experienced adverse effects involving the gastrointestinal tract. Though the table of adverse events does not explicitly list ""GI bleed"" as a side effect, it does mention adverse events such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, GI pain, which can sometimes be associated with or precede a GI bleed. 
  - The warnings section of the label references bleed-related adverse effects, including GI bleeding (""gastrointestinal bleeding"") under the ""Hemorrhagic"" subsection. This adds to the evidence that ticlopidine has been associated with increased bleeding, and given its context, this includes GI bleeding.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance:**
  - The post-marketing experience, which includes data collected after the drug is approved and marketed, has reported serious and potentially fatal events associated with ticlopidine use. Though GI bleed is not mentioned by name, the warning on peptic ulcer, which can cause GI bleeding, is relevant. When considered alongside the hemorrhagic warnings from clinical trials, this suggests a relationship between ticlopidine use and potential GI bleeding.

3. **Conclusions:**
  - Clinically, the association between ticlopidine and GI bleed is supported by the general category of increased bleeding risk, including gastrointestinal bleeding as noted in the warnings section. The incidence of hemorrhagic adverse reactions (such as intracerebral bleeding) in clinical trials is compared to aspirin and placebo, with incidences reported as rare and at a similar rate to comparator agents. GI bleeding is thus implicitly suggested as a potential risk of therapy with ticlopidine due to its association with increased bleeding events.
  
It's important to note that while the risk of GI bleeding is indicated, the drug label also specifies that most adverse effects, including GI-related issues, are mild and reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. However, the severity and the presence of serious conditions following ticlopidine administration, such as peptic ulcers revealed in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea, underscores the potential for serious GI bleeding events. 

In summary, while not explicitly listed in the provided table of adverse events from clinical trials, the relationship between ticlopathy exposure and gi bleed is substantiated through a combination of clinical-trial-based evidence and incidences reported via post-marketing surveillance. This is particularly evident in the hematological and gastrointestinal warning sections of the drug label.",NA
gi bleed,tinzaparin,,"The available evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as an adverse reaction of tinzaparin is based on clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and the pharmacological properties of the drug.

Clinical Trials:
In clinical trials, bleeding events, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, are among the most common adverse reactions associated with INNOHEP® (tinzaparin sodium injection), which is an anticoagulant used for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE). The definition of major bleeding in the trials included criteria such as bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 grams/dL, requiring transfusion of 2 or more units of blood products, or bleeding at critical sites (intracranial, retroperitoneal, or into a prosthetic joint). Major bleeding events occurred in 0.8% of the patients treated with INNOHEP® compared to 2.7% in the group treated with unfractionated heparin.

There are specific examples of GI bleeding reported in clinical trials, such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage listed under the 'bleeding-related' section of serious adverse events associated with INNOHEP® in clinical trials (Table 6). This indicates direct evidence of GI bleed as an adverse event attributed to tinzaparin sodium use in a controlled clinical context.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
From post-marketing surveillance data (Table 7), other bleeding-related adverse events such as rectal bleeding and hemoptysis have been reported. Although the specific term ""GI bleed"" isn't used, rectal bleeding falls under the category of GI bleeding, being part of the lower gastrointestinal tract. The reported bleeding events in the post-marketing setting support the evidence that hemorrhagic complications are a known risk when using tinzaparin.

Pharmacological Properties:
As an anticoagulant, tinzaparin inhibits the formation of blood clots by thinning the blood. This pharmacological action inherently increases the risk of bleeding, including GI bleeding, as a potential adverse reaction. Understanding the pharmacological basis of anticoagulation aids in recognizing the plausibility of GI bleed being related to tinzaparin use.

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance to support the association between GI bleed as an adverse reaction to tinzaparin, along with a pharmacological rationale for this relationship. Patients treated with tinzaparin are at a known risk for bleeding complications, including those in the gastrointestinal system. These findings are consistent with the drug's labeling, which highlights the possibility of hemorrhage in anticoagulated patients and cites instances of gastrointestinal bleeding.","NA

Based on the information provided, gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is listed as a potential serious adverse event (gastrointestinal hemorrhage) associated with the use of INNOHEP® (tinzaparin sodium injection). It is included in the clinical trial data (Table 6) as one of the bleeding-related serious adverse events. As such, there is evidence linking GI bleed as an adverse reaction to tinzaparin, and there is no available evidence refuting this relationship in the provided drug label sections."
gi bleed,tirofiban,,"Evidence from the provided drug label suggests that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction of Tirofiban, an antiplatelet medication commonly used in the setting of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The drug label highlights bleeding as the most commonly reported adverse reaction to Tirofiban Hydrochloride Injection. Here is a summary of the evidence derived from the clinical trials and post-marketing experience:

Clinical Trials:
According to the PRISM-PLUS study, the incidence of major and minor bleeding was higher in patients who received Tirofiban Hydrochloride Injection in combination with heparin compared to heparin alone:
- Major bleeding (which could include GI bleeding): 1.4% with Tirofiban + Heparin vs. 0.8% with Heparin alone
- Transfusion requirement (often a result of significant bleeding such as GI bleeding): 4.0% with Tirofiban + Heparin vs. 2.8% with Heparin alone

Furthermore, the rates of major bleeding events, which may encompass GI bleeding, were consistent in other sections of the population treated with the recommended Tirofiban regimen, comparable to the rates observed in the PRISM-PLUS regimen.

Post-Marketing Surveillance:
Although the drug label does not specify the incidences of GI bleeding in the post-marketing experience section, it emphasizes that bleeding is the most common adverse event reported. GI bleeding would fall under the category of serious bleeding complications which necessitate discontinuation of the drug as mentioned under Warnings (5.1) in the drug label.

No quantitative data on the specific incidence of GI bleeds after Tirofiban exposure in the post-marketing setting is provided in the document.

In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials indicates a relationship between Tirofiban use and an increased incidence of bleeding events, which could include GI bleeding. The higher rates of major and minor bleeding, as well as transfusion requirements in patients receiving Tirofiban, support the relationship between the drug and potential GI bleeds. However, specific quantitative data on GI bleeding as a distinct category within these incidences is not provided in the document excerpts shared. Additional clinical studies and more detailed post-marketing data would be required to quantify the specific risk of GI bleeding associated with Tirofiban.",NA
gi bleed,tivozanib,,"Based on the information provided, tivozanib (FOTIVDA) has been associated with several adverse reactions and specific warnings and cautions are listed on its label, including hemorrhagic events. It is indicated that hemorrhagic events occurred in 11% of patients treated with tivozanib, and fatal hemorrhagic events occurred in 0.2% of patients. Hemorrhagic events of various types are listed, including but not limited to hematuria, epistaxis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and cerebral hemorrhage.

The label specifically includes gastrointestinal hemorrhage within the broader category of hemorrhagic events, which suggests that gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) is recognized as a potential adverse reaction of tivozanib. This information is derived from clinical trial experiences, specifically the TIVO-3 trial, which evaluated the safety of tivozanib in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who received two or more prior systemic treatments. The adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in the TIVO-3 trial are well documented in the supplied drug label sections.

Therefore, the evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed and tivozanib comes from clinical trial data, with the TIVO-3 trial explicitly providing this information. Furthermore, the drug label’s ""WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS"" section also advises close monitoring of patients who are at risk for or have a history of bleeding, indicating that the risk of bleeding, including GI bleed, is taken into consideration for patient management.

In summary, the evidence from clinical trials, as reflected in the product labeling, supports the relationship between GI bleed and tivozanib exposure. This evidence is primarily based on the adverse reactions reported in the context of the TIVO-3 trial and is incorporated into the label's warnings and precautions to inform healthcare providers and patients.",NA
gi bleed,tizanidine,,"The drug label information provided for tizanidine does not list gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a reported adverse reaction from clinical trials or postmarketing experience. Tizanidine, based on the label sections provided, primarily shows a propensity for adverse reactions such as dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, liver function abnormalities, and hypotension, among others.

Clinical Trials Experience:
The adverse reactions described for tizanidine from clinical trials are primarily related to its expected pharmacological action as a central alpha-2-adrenergic agonist. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the clinical trials, which involved both multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury patients, included dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia, and dizziness.

Postmarketing Experience:
The postmarketing experience for tizanidine lists additional adverse reactions not observed in the clinical trials. These adverse events are voluntarily reported and include, but are not limited to, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, exfoliative dermatitis, ventricular tachycardia, hepatitis, convulsion, depression, arthralgia, paresthesia, rash, and tremor. Notably, GI bleeding is not mentioned in the postmarketing experience section either.

Based on the drug label information provided, there is no known evidence to support a relationship between tizanidine exposure and the potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to note that this conclusion is specific to the details presented in the label and that such labels can be updated if new evidence arises. Therefore, it is advisable to consult the latest drug label or medical literature for the most current information. Additionally, healthcare professionals should report any observed adverse reactions to the appropriate bodies, such as the FDA, to continuously update the safety profile of medications.",NA
gi bleed,tolcapone,,"The provided drug label for tolcapone, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, contains detailed information about various adverse reactions observed in patients during clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. However, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse reaction directly attributable to tolcapone in the sections provided. 

The label does mention ""gastrointestinal hemorrhage"" as an infrequent event observed in the digestive system during trials, without specifying whether this is directly related to tolcapone use or not. Infrequent events are defined as those occurring in between 1/100 and 1/1000 patients. It's important to note that the presence of this adverse event does not confirm a causal relationship with the medication, as clinical trials and post-marketing experiences often report events without establishing causality.

It is worth mentioning that many patients with Parkinson's disease are concurrently treated with other medications including levodopa/carbidopa, which might also contribute to the risk of adverse reactions such as gastrointestinal issues. This complexity underscores the difficulty of attributing GI bleed specifically to tolcapone without further investigational data.

In summary, based on the provided sections of the drug label, there is not a clearly established relationship between tolcapone use and GI bleeding. The evidence does not specifically cite GI bleed as a common adverse reaction to tolcapone, though gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported infrequently. It's crucial to consider the entire clinical context, including concomitant medication use and patient history, when evaluating the risk of GI bleeding in patients taking tolcapone. 

For the most accurate evaluation, clinicians should refer to the complete label, the latest medical literature, and pharmacovigilance resources to fully assess the risk of GI bleed in relation to tolcapone exposure. If such data becomes available, it would provide a more robust basis for understanding any potential association.",NA
gi bleed,tolmetin,1.0,"Based on the drug label information provided, there is evidence to support the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and the use of tolmetin, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The specific evidence can be summarized as follows:

1. Clinical Trials: GI bleeding is recognized as an adverse reaction with a probable causal relationship to tolmetin, occurring in less than 1% of patients in controlled clinical trials. Additionally, GI complaints such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and peptic ulcer were also significantly frequent, with nausea occurring in 11% of patients. About 10% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events that were mostly gastrointestinal in nature.

2. Post-Marketing Surveillance: The occurrence of GI bleeding has been reported since the marketing of the drug. Tolmetin's label lists gastrointestinal bleeding both with and without evidence of peptic ulcer as probable adverse reactions that are less frequent but causally related to the medication. The frequency of these events during post-marketing is not provided, but their inclusion indicates that further cases have been observed following the approval of the drug.

3. Boxed Warnings: Tolmetin, like other NSAIDs, carries a boxed warning indicating a heightened risk of serious GI adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, the severity of which can be fatal. No specific incidence rate for GI bleeding related to tolmetin is provided in the boxed warning; however, it highlights the serious nature of this risk with NSAID use.

The clinical trials data, post-marketing surveillance, and the boxed warnings collectively provide evidence that GI bleeding is an adverse reaction associated with the use of tolmetin. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or those concurrently using other anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids, might have an increased risk for GI bleeding while on tolmetin. Elderly patients are indicated to be at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events, but a direct incidence rate of these effects specifically related to tolmetin is not detailed in the information provided.

gi bleed,tolvaptan,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for tolvaptan, there is evidence that gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically including gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, can be an adverse reaction to tolvaptan in a certain patient population. This conclusion is drawn from clinical trials observations reported in the label. The relevant information can be summarized as follows:

1. **Clinical Trials Evidence:**
   - In a subgroup of patients with hyponatremia due to cirrhosis who participated in clinical trials of tolvaptan, gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 6 out of 63 (10%) tolvaptan-treated patients. In contrast, only 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo-treated patients reported this adverse reaction. This data suggests a higher incidence of GI bleeding in patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan compared to placebo.
   - The trials included 607 hyponatremic patients treated with tolvaptan. While the specific mention of GI bleed is in relation to the subset with cirrhosis, the broader safety profile from these trials informs about other potential gastrointestinal disturbances and adverse reactions that have been recorded more frequently with tolvaptan than placebo.

2. **Post-Marketing Surveillance Evidence:**
   - There is no specific mention of GI bleed in the post-marketing experience section provided. This section only notes that osmotic demyelination syndrome and hypernatremia have been reported after the drug was approved, among other adverse reactions. While post-marketing data can often provide additional insights into rare or long-term adverse reactions, in this case, it does not add to the evidence concerning GI bleed.

3. **Summary of Evidence:**
   - There is evidence from controlled clinical trials indicating that GI bleed is a potential adverse reaction to tolvaptan in patients with cirrhosis. The data shows a statistically significant difference in the incidence of GI bleeding between tolvaptan-treated patients (10%) versus those receiving placebo (2%) in this subgroup.
   - No evidence of GI bleed being an adverse reaction has been explicitly stated in the general population treated with tolvaptan based on the provided label information. However, it is important to note that clinical trial environments are controlled settings and may not capture all adverse reactions seen in the wider patient population post-marketing.

4. **Limitations and Considerations:**
   - The provided label information is specific to patients with the condition of hyponatremia, a segment of which had underlying cirrhosis. It is not clear if the higher incidence of GI bleed is related to tolvaptan itself or the underlying cirrhosis, or a combination of both.
   - Without detailed data on individual case reports or more extensive epidemiological studies, it is difficult to establish a causal relationship of tolvaptan with GI bleed outside the cirrhotic population.
   - It is always necessary to consider the full clinical context, patient history, and concomitant medications when evaluating any reported adverse reaction to determine causality.

In conclusion, there is evidence supporting an increased risk of GI bleed as an adverse reaction to tolvaptan in patients with hyponatremia and cirrhosis based on clinical trials. However, this information may not necessarily extend to all populations taking tolvaptan, and the causality in individuals without cirrhosis is not clearly supported by the provided information.","There is evidence refuting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and tolvaptan use in hyponatremic patients without cirrhosis. Specifically, in several trials and studies mentioned in the provided drug label sections, GI bleeding is not listed as one of the common adverse reactions in patients with hyponatremia treated with tolvaptan. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were thirst, dry mouth, asthenia, constipation, pollakiuria or polyuria, and hyperglycemia.

However, within a subgroup of hyponatremic patients with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in the clinical trials, GI bleeding was observed at a higher frequency (6 out of 63 patients, or 10%) in those treated with tolvaptan compared to placebo-treated patients (1 out of 57 patients, or approximately 2%). It should be noted that this information pertains specifically to the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis, which is a known risk factor for GI bleeding due to complications such as portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Thus, the available evidence suggests that in the general population of patients with hyponatremia without cirrhosis, GI bleeding is not a common adverse reaction associated with tolvaptan based on the clinical trials data presented in the drug label.

Regarding postmarketing experience, the label does not list GI bleeding as an observed adverse reaction in the population of unknown size taking tolvaptan. However, due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reports and the potentially limited scope of these reports, the absence of reported GI bleeding does not conclusively rule out a possible relation but indicates that such adverse events are either not occurring at a frequency warranting specific mention in this context or have not been recognized as associated with the drug.

To summarize, while there is some evidence of an increased occurrence of GI bleeding in a specific subgroup of tolvaptan-treated patients with hyponatremia and cirrhosis, there is no evidence in the provided drug label sections indicating that GI bleeding is a common adverse reaction in the broader population of patients without cirrhosis treated with tolvastan.

Sources: 
- Drug label sections provided by the user (Adverse Reactions [6], Warnings and Precautions [5], Postmarketing Experience [6.2])."
gi bleed,tolvaptan,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for tolvaptan, the evidence for a potential adverse reaction of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, specifically in the context of cirrhosis, is noted in the clinical trial experience. 

In the Clinical Trials Experience section (6.1), the drug label reports gastrointestinal bleeding events in patients with cirrhosis who were treated with tolvaptan. Out of 63 tolvaptan-treated patients with cirrhosis, 6 (10%) experienced GI bleeding, in comparison to 1 out of 57 (2%) placebo-treated patients. This suggests an association between tolvaptan use and an increased incidence of GI bleeding in this specific patient population. 

The report does not provide a detailed mechanism by which tolvaptan may induce GI bleeding, nor does it mention GI bleed as a common adverse effect in the general population of patients treated with tolvaptan. It is specific to the subgroup of patients with hyponatremia and cirrhosis. The warnings and precautions sections do not list GI bleed as a common adverse effect or as one requiring a box warning. 

It is essential to note that this information is drawn from controlled clinical trials and may not reflect rates observed in broader clinical practice. However, these controlled trials provide some basis for identifying adverse events potentially related to drug use. 

In summary, there is evidence from clinical trials indicating an association between tolvaptan and the occurrence of GI bleeding in a subset of patients with cirrhosis. This evidence is based on the observed higher incidence of GI bleeding in tolvaptan-treated cirrhotic patients compared to those receiving placebo during clinical studies. 

For a comprehensive assessment of this potential adverse effect, healthcare professionals should also consider additional information from continued post-marketing surveillance, as the drug label encourages reporting of suspected adverse reactions to Otsuka (the pharmaceutical company) or the FDA.",NA
gi bleed,torsemide,,"Based on the sections provided from the drug label of torsemide, there is no explicit evidence mentioned that directly associates torsemide with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction in either clinical trial data (section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience) or post-marketing experience (section 6.2 Postmarketing Experience).

The sections provided focus on various other potential adverse reactions and risks, such as:

- Excessive urination (most common adverse reaction mentioned)
- Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia)
- Hypotension and worsening renal function
- Ototoxicity (risk of tinnitus and hearing loss)
- Laboratory parameter changes (increases in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid)
- Postmarketing reports of pancreatitis, abdominal pain (though not specifically GI bleed), increases in liver transaminases, and other adverse reactions affecting multiple systems

It is essential to note that while abdominal pain is listed in the postmarketing experience, it is not synonymous with GI bleed and could represent a variety one of conditions unrelated to bleeding. Therefore, from the information you provided, there is no known evidence within these sections of the drug label to support a relationship between torsemide and GI bleed as an adverse reaction.

If there are suspicions or hypotheses about a potential adverse reaction like GI bleed with torsemide, it would be important to look into more data sources or conduct post-marketing surveillance and pharmacoepidemiological studies to establish any potential links. Health professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to regulatory authorities to facilitate the identification of such potential relationships.",NA
gi bleed,tramadol,,"The provided sections of the drug label for tramadol hydrochloride tablets dive into various adverse reactions, warnings, and boxed warnings, which are essential for understanding the risks associated with the medication. However, the extensive sections do not mention gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding directly as a common adverse reaction in the clinical trials subsection 6.1 or as a labeled warning.

In the clinical trials experience subsection (6.1), GI-related adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia are mentioned. Table 1 in this section suggests that gastrointestinal adverse reactions are among the most frequently reported events, with constipation, nausea, and vomiting being quite common, although it does not specifically mention GI bleeding.

In the postmarketing experience subsection (6.2), GI bleeding is listed under the ""Other Adverse Experiences, Causal Relationship Unknown."" It indicates that gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported with postmarketing experience, but a causal relationship with tramadol hydrochloride tablets has not been determined. Therefore, the evidence regarding tramadol directly causing GI bleed seems to come from the postmarketing phase, rather than controlled clinical trials, and the causal relationship remains unclear.

The warnings and precautions section (5), particularly 5.16, addresses the risks associated with tramadol use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions, indicating that tramadol is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction. However, it does again not explicitly address GI bleeding.

Given the information provided, there seems to be a recognition of gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential adverse event in patients taking tramadol based on postmarketing reports, but no solid established causal relationship from clinical trial data. Health care professionals are often advised to monitor for such reactions and report them to the relevant regulatory bodies, such as the FDA. Patients who exhibit symptoms suggestive of GI bleeding should seek immediate medical attention, and healthcare providers should consider these risks when prescribing tramadol.",NA
gi bleed,trametinib,,"Based on the provided drug label information, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (which includes events such as GI bleed) is listed as an adverse reaction under the Warnings and Precautions (5.2) for patients taking trametinib (known by the brand name MEKINIST), particularly when it is used in combination with the drug dabrafenib. This suggests that there is evidence for gi bleed as a potential adverse reaction of trametinib. The evidence stems from multiple sources in the clinical development program:

1. Clinical Trials Experience (Section 6.1):
   - Hemorrhagic events, including GI bleed, are reported in adult patients as an adverse reaction in the pooled safety population from clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib (17% of patients experienced hemorrhagic events).
   - Specific incidences of GI hemorrhage are documented in 3% of adult patients, and there were fatal cases (0.5%).
   - Pediatric pooled safety population also shows hemorrhagic events in 25% of patients with types of bleeding such as epistasis (nosebleeds) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
   - Major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ resulted in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST for all Grade 4 hemorrhages and for Grade 3 events that do not improve.

2. Warnings and Precautions (Sections 5.2, 5.4, and 5.5):
   - A warning is provided for increased risk of hemorrhages with the use of trametinib, with advice to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding.
   - Recommendations for dose adjustments (interruption, reduction, or discontinuation) are provided for patients who experience Grade 3 or higher hemorrhagic events.
   - Increased risk for other adverse cardiovascular effects like cardiomyopathy (including cardiac failure) is also cited, which can co-occur with hemorrhagic events.

3. Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2):
   - Adverse reactions identified during post-approval use are listed based on reports from trametinib users after the drug has entered the market.

The labeling information clearly states that healthcare professionals should monitor patients for signs of GI bleeding when receiving trametinib and that fatal hemorrhages have been reported. Moreover, recommendations for managing these adverse reactions, including treatment discontinuation and dose adjustments, are outlined, reflecting the risk and clinical importance of this potential adverse effect.

Lastly, it's important to note that while the information provided in the drug label supports an association between trametinib and GI bleed, the exact incidence rates and strength of the causal relationship could be further understood by reviewing the original clinical trial data, specific case reports, and larger epidemiological studies from post-marketing surveillance. However, the label information does not include these detailed data.",NA
gi bleed,trametinib,,"The provided drug label for trametinib (MEKINIST) includes substantial information on its safety profile and potential adverse reactions based on clinical trials and postmarketing experience. There is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a distinct adverse event. However, the label provides data on related adverse events of interest:

1. **Hemorrhage**: 
   - **Adult Safety Pool**: Hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients, with gastrointestinal hemorrhage specifically occurring in 3%. Additionally, intracranial hemorrhage was reported in 0.6%, with some instances (0.5%) being fatal due to cerebral and brainstem hemorrhages. These figures suggest a relationship between trametinib exposure and bleeding risks, which could potentially include GI bleeding.
   - **Pediatric Safety Pool**: Hemorrhagic events were reported in 25% of pediatric patients. While the most common bleeding type was epistaxis (nosebleed), serious bleeding events like gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 1.2% of pediatric patients. This suggests that GI bleeding is a potential risk in this population as well.

2. **Warnings and Precautions**:
   - The label warns of major hemorrhagic events and includes instructions to monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. The recommendation to permanently discontinue trametinib for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for certain Grade 3 hemorrhagic events, which may encompass GI bleeds, indicates that there is a clinically significant risk of severe bleeding.

3. **Clinical Trials and Postmarketing Experience**:
   - In clinical trials, adverse events related to hemorrhage and colitis were documented, which are clinical manifestations consistent with GI bleeding.
   - In postmarketing surveillance, no additional specific data on GI bleeding were provided, but serious cutaneous and non-cutaneous adverse reactions, including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have been reported. DRESS has been known to be associated with GI complications, although these complications are not specifically described in the label.

In conclusion, while GI bleeding is not explicitly mentioned as a discrete adverse event in the drug label for trametinib, there is documented evidence of hemorrhagic events and gastrointestinal hemorrhage that is described under the broader category of hemorrhage in both the adult and pediatric safety populations. The label recommendations to monitor for and potentially discontinue trametinib in the event of serious hemorrhagic events suggest a recognized risk that is relevant to clinical practice.

Healthcare professionals prescribing MEKINIST should carefully assess the risk of bleeding and educate patients about the signs and symptoms of severe hemorrhage, including GI bleeding, and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention should these arise.",NA
gi bleed,tretinoin,,"Based on the information provided from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance detailed in the drug label for tretinoin, gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, which includes GI bleeding, was identified as one of the adverse reactions to tretinoin. In clinical trials evaluating the safety of tretinoin capsules in patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), one of the common adverse reactions reported in more than 30% of patients was gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Table 1 within the drug label specifies that gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 34% of patients treated with tretinoin capsules.

Post-marketing experience, which draws upon voluntary reports from healthcare professionals and patients, cannot always reliably estimate the frequency of adverse reactions or establish a definitive causal relationship to drug exposure because of the uncertain size of the reporting population. Within the post-marketing experience section, there is no direct mention of GI bleeding as an observed adverse event distinct from those reported in clinical trial data.

In summary, evidence for GI bleeding as an adverse reaction to tretinoin comes from clinical trial data, as gastrointestinal hemorrhage was reported in a significant proportion of treated patients. However, no specific frequency or causality has been clearly established from post-marketing surveillance due to the nature of voluntary reporting and the lack of detailed data on this particular adverse event in that section.",NA
gi bleed,valproate,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction specifically attributed to valproate use. The label does list several gastrointestinal system-related adverse reactions observed in clinical trials, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, constipation, anorexia, and hemorrhagic pancreatitis, but GI bleeding is not directly listed under common adverse reactions (section 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS).

However, it is mentioned in the ""Warnings and Precautions"" section (5.8 Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders) that valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia, a condition that can affect clotting and potentially increase the risk of bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, an explicit connection between valproate and GI bleeding is not made in this section of the label either.

Furthermore, valproate's effects on coagulation parameters are noted, as it may cause inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation and result in abnormalities, such as low fibrinogen or acquired von Willebrand's disease. These coagulation abnormalities could theoretically increase the risk of bleeding, including GI bleeding.

In the ""Postmarketing Experience"" section (6.2), there's acknowledgment of reported adverse reactions following valproate use based on voluntary submissions from an uncertain population size. However, it is not explicitly stated if GI bleeding has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Therefore, based on this label information alone, we cannot confirm a known, reported incidence of GI bleeding attributed directly to valproate use.

To conclude, there is no direct evidence in the provided sections of the valproate drug label that GI bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction to valproate. The label mentions thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities, which may theoretically increase the risk of bleeding, but the connection to GI bleeds as a specific adverse reaction is not made. Therefore, if GI bleeding is suspected to be associated with valproate use in practice, it might be based on postmarketing reports or clinical experience not explicitly detailed in the label, or it may be an extrapolation from valproate's known effects on the hematopoietic system and coagulation. One should review detailed postmarketing surveillance data and clinical study reports for more specific evidence linking valproate to GI bleeding incidents.",NA
gi bleed,varenicline,,"Based on the provided drug label sections, there is no direct evidence to support a relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the use of varenicline. The adverse reactions section and post-marketing experience of the drug label do not list GI bleeding as a reported adverse event. The listed gastrointestinal disorders primarily include nausea, constipation, flatulence, vomiting, and in some infrequent cases, dyspepsia, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is mentioned; however, it is categorized as ""infrequent,"" with no specific mention of GI bleed.

Clinical trials experience with varenicline did not yield a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events beyond those commonly associated with the drug, such as nausea. Postmarketing experience indicates reports of several adverse events but does not directly implicate GI bleed as a common or well-characterized outcome of varenicline treatment.

It's imperative to note that individual patient experiences and reports may vary, and not all adverse reactions may be captured in clinical trials or postmarketing surveillance due to underreporting or the specificity of the data collected.

In summary, based on the information within the drug label, there is no substantiated evidence linking varenicline to GI bleed as an adverse reaction. Clinicians prescribing varenicline should continue to monitor for adverse events as recommended in the label and consider the individual patient's risk factors and clinical history. If new evidence becomes available or regulatory agencies provide updated information, assessments and recommendations may change accordingly.",NA
gi bleed,venetoclax,,"Based on the provided sections from the drug label for venetoclax, there are no explicit mentions of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction or warning. The sections describe various studies that show the most frequent adverse reactions for different conditions in which venetoclax is used, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Notably, among the listed common adverse reactions (≥20% for CLL/SLL; ≥30% for AML), GI bleeding is not specifically mentioned. However, hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, is cited as a common adverse reaction (≥30% in any AML trial).

In the clinical trial data of venetoclax (specifically Section 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience and Table 15 Adverse Reactions in the VIALE-A trial for AML), hemorrhage, which encompasses not only GI bleeding but also other forms of bleeding, is reported. It is important to note that ""hemorrhage"" is a broad term that can refer to bleeding in various parts of the body, and GI bleed could potentially be a part of this broader category.

Post-marketing surveillance is a tool for identifying adverse events that might not have been captured during clinical trials due to various reasons, including the limited size of clinical trials, their shorter duration, or because certain adverse events are rare. For venetoclax, the label mentions the option to report suspected adverse reactions to either the manufacturer AbbVie Inc. or the FDA. Since the label does not explicitly report post-marketing surveillance data suggesting an association between venetoclax and GI bleeding, it can be concluded that up to the knowledge cutoff date, there is no direct, substantial evidence from post-marketing surveillance specifically linking venetoclax with GI bleeding.

To summarize, while hemorrhage of any type is a recognized adverse event of venetoclax, particularly in the treatment of AML, the provided drug label sections do not specifically cite GI bleed as a common adverse reaction. For a definitive association of venetoclax and GI bleeding, further detailed analysis of clinical trial data, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data would be required, beyond the scope of the information provided here.

gi bleed,venlafaxine,,"The provided drug label sections outline various adverse reactions and safety concerns associated with the use of venlafaxine, an antidepressant medication. However, the specific adverse reaction in question—gastrointestinal bleeding or gi bleed—is not explicitly mentioned in these sections.

In the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials cited, 19% of venlafaxine patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, but there is no direct mention of gi bleed as a cause. The most commonly observed adverse events related to the gastrointestinal system included nausea, constipation, anorexia, and vomiting, none of which is gi bleed.

Postmarketing reports listed various other adverse events temporally associated with venlafaxine, including hemorrhage, but it specifically mentions eye and gastrointestinal bleeding, but without explicit referral to gi bleed as a distinct category.

The section about ""Digestive system"" under ""Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Venlafaxine"" lists gastrointestinal ulcer, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and hematemesis among infrequent to rare events. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage can be interpreted as including gi bleeds. However, due to its classification as an infrequent to rare event, the evidence does not suggest a strong or consistent relationship between venlafaxine use and gi bleed.

Laboratory changes indicate increases in serum cholesterol and ECG changes in heart rate but give no indication of blood parameters that would suggest a prevalent risk of bleeding disorders.

Overall, while there is some mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an infrequent to rare event, the provided label sections do not establish a clear, strong relationship between venlafaxine and the specific adverse reaction of gi bleed. For a definitive assessment, information from peer-reviewed studies, larger patient population data, or comprehensive meta-analyses would be needed. Additionally, when evaluating the risk of gi bleed with venlafaxine, it would also be important to consider patient-specific factors, such as concurrent medication use (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants) or pre-existing conditions that may contribute to an increased risk of bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,vigabatrin,,"Based on the provided drug label sections for vigabatrin (SABRIL), there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance data. The detailed adverse reactions described in the sections focus mainly on neurological and visual side effects, metabolic alterations, and systemic symptoms.

In the clinical trial experience (section 6.1), gastrointestinal-related adverse events such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, stomach discomfort, and abdominal pain are reported; however, GI bleed is not specifically listed among them. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% over placebo) documented for different patient groups (adults, pediatric patients, and infants) do not include GI bleed.

The postmarketing experience (section 6.2) mentions gastrointestinal hemorrhage as an adverse reaction observed after approval but does not provide frequency data or establish a causal relationship between this event and vigabatrin exposure. It is also important to note that post-marketing surveillance data relies on voluntary reporting, which can make it harder to estimate the actual incidence or establish causality of adverse reactions.

Therefore, while gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been mentioned in the postmarketing context, the evidence to strongly support a causal relationship between GI bleed and vigabatrin based on the provided sections of the drug label is limited. Health care providers might consider this potential risk in the context of postmarketing voluntary reports without specific frequency data or a clear causative link. Further analysis or research might be necessary to better understand the relationship between vigabatrin and the risk of GI bleed. 

It is recommended that health care professionals report any suspected adverse reactions to Lundbeck at 1-800-455-1141 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch to help gather more data and better understand potential side effects of the medication.",NA
gi bleed,vigabatrin,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for vigabatrin, there is no mention or evidence in the described adverse reactions, warnings, or post-marketing surveillance of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction to the use of vigabatrin. The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with vigabatrin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) include headache, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, convulsion, nasopharyngitis, weight gain, upper respiratory tract infection, visual field defect, depression, tremor, nystagmus, nausea, diarrhea, memory impairment, insomnia, irritability, abnormal coordination, blurred vision, diplopia, and others.

GI-related adverse reactions that are listed include diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, and other abdominal related issues. However, GI bleed is not specifically mentioned as an observed adverse event in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance based on the information provided.

Moreover, the box warnings and other warnings focus primarily on the risk of permanent vision loss, the requirement for a restricted distribution program due to this risk, and various other precautions regarding MRI abnormalities, neurotoxicity, suicidal behavior, withdrawal of AEDs, anemia, somnolence, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, weight gain, and edema.

In conclusion, there is no known evidence from the clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance detailed in the provided drug label sections to suggest a relationship between vigabatrin and gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction. It is important to review the complete drug label and consult newer sources or pharmacovigilance data for any updates on adverse reactions that could emerge after the knowledge cutoff date.",NA
gi bleed,vorapaxar,,"The evidence supporting the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and exposure to the drug vorapaxar (marketed as ZONTIVITY) is drawn from clinical trial data, specifically the TRA 2°P TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events) Phase 3 study. As outlined in the drug's label, vorapaxar has been associated with increased bleeding risks, which include GI bleeding as an adverse reaction.

Here is a concise summary of the evidence, drawn from the sections of the drug label you provided:

1. Clinical Study (TRA 2°P TIMI 50):
   - The safety of vorapaxar was evaluated in a large population of 13,186 patients.
   - In this study, GI bleeding was reported in 4.0% of patients taking vorapaxar compared to 3.0% of patients taking placebo, presenting a hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.18-1.59).
   - The study showed that vorapaxar increased the total number of GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) moderate or severe bleeding incidents by 55%. GUSTO classification is a scale used to measure bleeding severity.
   - The findings were based on patients with post-myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) without a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

2. Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions:
   - The drug label contains a boxed warning, the most stringent warning from the FDA, which highlights the increased risk of bleeding, including GI bleeding.
   - In the warnings section, it is advised that the risk of bleeding, including GI hemorrhage, is augmented by vorapaxar and especially in the presence of other risk factors for bleeding. Antiplatelet agents, like vorapaxar, are known to generally increase the risk of bleeding complications.

3. Post-Marketing Surveillance:
   - While no specific data from post-marketing surveillance is provided in the sections you've included, it is noted that adverse reactions, including bleeding, should be reported. This suggests that ongoing surveillance is being conducted and that further data may be contributed from real-world use outside of controlled clinical trial conditions.

Based on the above evidence from the TRA 2°P TIMI 50 study, vorapaxar has been associated with an increased risk of GI bleeding compared to placebo, with a higher percentage of patients experiencing GI bleeding when on the medication. The available data from clinical trials clearly support the relationship between vorapaxar exposure and the potential adverse reaction of GI bleeding.",NA
gi bleed,vorapaxar,,"Evidence from clinical trials indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a recognized adverse reaction associated with the use of vorapaxar (marketed as ZONTIVITY), particularly in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (post-MI) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) without a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The supporting data come from the Phase 3 study TRA 2°P TIMI 50, which evaluated vorapaxar's safety in 13,186 patients. The trial showed that vorapaxar increased the risk of GI bleeding by 37% compared to placebo (hazard ratio of 1.37, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.18-1.59). Specifically, 4.0% (400 out of 10,059) of patients treated with vorapaxar experienced GI bleeding, versus 3.0% (297 out of 10,049) in the placebo group. This result is included in the adverse events table within the drug's prescribing information.

Additionally, the medication's box warning and warnings/precautions sections underline the increased risk of bleeding in general, including both fatal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is consistent with the known risk profile of antiplatelet agents, but do not specifically mention GI bleeding.

The summary on the adverse reactions of vorapaxar (ZONTIVITY) from the drug label clearly supports the relationship between the drug exposure and potential adverse reaction of GI bleed. It is based on data from a large-scale, controlled clinical trial and is corroborated by the emphasis on bleeding risk in the drug's warnings.

If we had access to post-marketing surveillance reports or case studies, we could provide further evidence. Nonetheless, the clinical trial data articulates a clear association, which is reflected in the prescribing information of the medication.

gi bleed,voriconazole,,"Voriconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections. The provided drug label sections detail a variety of adverse reactions observed in patients treated with voriconazole but do not explicitly mention gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as an adverse reaction.

Evidence supporting the relationship between GI bleed and voriconazole exposure is as follows:

**Clinical Trials:** The provided drug label sections including ""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS,"" ""6.1 Clinical Trials Experience,"" and ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience in Adult and Pediatric Patients"" do not describe GI bleed as a reported adverse reaction in the clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance. Adverse reactions listed predominantly include visual disturbances, skin reactions, and hepatic toxicity, among others.

**Case Reports and Studies:** As GI bleed is not specifically mentioned in the clinical trial evidence or labeled adverse reactions, any significant association would need to be sought in individual case reports, observational studies, or pharmacovigilance databases that are not provided in this excerpt.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:** The ""6.2 Postmarketing Experience in Adult and Pediatric patients"" section describes various adverse reactions identified during the post-approval use of voriconazole. Although there is mention of different dermatological, skeletal, and endocrine disorders, GI bleed is not specifically listed as an observed adverse reaction post-marketing.

In summary, based on the content in the provided sections of the voriconazole drug label, there is no cited evidence of an association between voriconazole and GI bleed either from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance. To draw any conclusions outside of this provided information, a search of the broader medical literature, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), or other pharmacovigilance databases would be necessary to ascertain if any case reports or observational studies have noted GI bleed as a potential adverse reaction to voriconazole. 

Given the absence of direct evidence linking voriconazole to GI bleed in the provided label sections, it is possible that if such a relationship exists, it may be rare or underreported. Always consider consulting the full prescribing information, up-to-date medical literature, or reporting databases for the most comprehensive assessment of adverse drug reactions.",NA
gi bleed,vorinostat,,"Based on the provided drug label information, gastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, has been reported as one of the serious adverse reactions in clinical trials associated with vorinostat (ZOLINZA) therapy (see Warnings and Precautions 5.3 and Adverse Reactions 6). Additionally, under Serious Adverse Reactions, there is a mention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which can encompass various conditions, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 

However, the term 'GI bleed' does not explicitly appear in the sections provided. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is listed as a single event in the Serious Adverse Reactions section, suggesting that it occurred in at least one patient, but without further details on the incidence rate or the circumstances under which this adverse reaction occurred, such as whether it was mild, moderate or severe, related to a known risk factor, or preventable with appropriate medical management.

Severe thrombocytopenia, which is a known risk factor for bleeding, has been reported both as an adverse reaction to vorinostat and with concomitant use with other HDAC inhibitors (see Warnings and Precautions 5.6), suggesting a potential mechanism whereby GI bleed could occur--though the direct correlation to actual GI bleed events is not detailed in the information provided.

In the absence of explicit data and incidence rates from clinical trials, case studies, or post-marketing surveillance specifically linking vorinostat to GI bleeding as a common adverse reaction, it can only be inferred that while gastrointestinal hemorrhage has occurred in patients taking vorinostat, the evidence does not allow for a conclusive or quantitative assessment of this risk.

Healthcare providers considering vorinostat (ZOLINZA) should monitor patients closely for signs of gastrointestinal toxicity and manage any emerging symptoms promptly, while being aware of the potential for serious gastrointestinal events such as GI bleeding, particularly in patients with risk factors for bleeding or when used in combination with other drugs that may increase the risk of hemorrhage.",NA
gi bleed,ziprasidone,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for ziprasidone, there is no explicit mention of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a common adverse reaction. The adverse reactions outlined for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder trials include somnolence, respiratory tract infection, extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, akathisia, abnormal vision, asthenia, and vomiting, among others.

The clinical trials data presented does not list GI bleed as an observed adverse reaction, and it is not enumerated in the summary of treatment-emergent adverse reactions in short-term, oral, placebo-controlled trials. The postmarketing experience section, which can sometimes capture rarer complications detected after a drug has been approved, also does not mention GI bleed as a reported adverse reaction.

GI bleed or related symptoms (e.g., hematemesis, melena) are documented under the ""digestive system"" subsection of adverse reactions, yet these are marked as rare, and it is explicitly noted that these events were reported during treatment with ziprasidone but were not necessarily caused by the medication. Without more compelling and direct evidence from the adverse reactions, warnings, and postmarketing sections of the label, we cannot establish a conclusive link between GI bleed and ziprasidone exposure. 

The absence of GI bleed from commonly observed adverse reactions and the lack of evidence from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance, as per provided drug label sections, indicate that there is no substantiated relationship between GI bleed and the standard therapeutic use of ziprasidone at the time of the knowledge cutoff. Healthcare providers should nonetheless remain vigilant for any new information or studies that may suggest otherwise. If GI bleed is suspected in the context of ziprasidone use, further investigation into the patient's history, concomitant medications, and underlying health conditions would be warranted to assess potential causality.",NA
gi bleed,zolmitriptan,,"Based on the information provided from the drug label, there is no direct evidence cited in the clinical trials or post-marketing experience sections that indicates gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) as a recognized adverse reaction specifically related to the exposure of zolmitriptan.

Zolmitriptan is a medication used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches and its adverse reactions as listed in clinical trial data (section 6.1) primarily include atypical sensations, pain and pressure sensations, digestive issues, neurological symptoms, and others, such as asthenia and sweating. GI-related adverse reactions were primarily limited to dry mouth, dyspepsia, dysphagia, and nausea.

In post-marketing experience (section 6.2), additional adverse reactions have been identified; however, GI bleed was not mentioned among these reactions. Therefore, based on the sections provided, there is no documented evidence connecting zolmitriptan to GI bleed.

Section 5.5 acknowledges the possibility of gastrointestinal ischemic reactions, which presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, but does not specifically mention GI bleed. It's important to differentiate that ischemic reactions can lead to tissue damage due to reduced blood flow, while a GI bleed is a more general term that can result from various etiologies, including but not limited to ischemia. 

Therefore, GI bleed is not listed among the common or rare adverse reactions observed during clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance of zolmitriptan, based on the drug label information provided. If there are incidents of GI bleed in patients taking zolmitriptan that are encountered outside of this data, it may require further investigation to establish a causal relationship. Health professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the FDA’s MedWatch program or corresponding regulatory bodies in other countries.",NA
gi bleed,zonisamide,,"Based on the provided sections of the drug label for zonisamide, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as a common adverse reaction. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials were somnolence, anorexia, dizziness, ataxia, agitation/irritability, difficulty with memory and/or concentration, and others as listed in the extensive breakdown provided. The digestive adverse reactions that were noted in at least 2% of patients and were more common in the zonisamide-treated group than in the placebo-treated group included anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, constipation, and dry mouth.

However, in some infrequent and rare cases, zonisamide was associated with digestive system issues such as vomiting, flatulence, gingivitis, gum hyperplasia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, stomatitis, cholelithiasis, glossitis, melena (dark stools indicative of bleeding in the stomach or intestines), rectal hemorrhage, ulcerative stomatitis, gastro-duodenal ulcer, and other serious conditions. While these do indicate potential concerns related to GI distress, the specific incidence of GI bleeding as a direct side effect is not emphasized. Melena and rectal hemorrhage are the most closely related to GI bleeding but are classified as infrequent events, occurring in 1:100 to 1:1,000 patients.

The post-marketing experience section does not list GI bleeding among the serious adverse reactions that have been reported since the approval and worldwide use of zonisamide. Nonetheless, because post-marketing reports are based on voluntary reporting and the population size is uncertain, it is possible that not all adverse reactions are captured, and the frequency or a causal relationship to drug exposure cannot be fully established.

In summary, while there is evidence suggesting that zonisamide can be associated with a range of digestive system adverse reactions, which may include conditions indicative of potential bleeding such as melena and rectal hemorrhage, these are infrequent and there is no clear, direct evidence in the provided label sections indicating that GI bleeding is a commonly recognized or well-characterized adverse reaction of zonisamide. Due to the nature of spontaneous reporting, a definitive causal link between zonisamide and GI bleeding cannot be established based on the information provided.",NA
