", there is no direct link established between acute kidney injury and cefaclor exposure. Clinical trials and studies have not shown a causal relationship between cefaclor and acute kidney injury."
"Based on the available information, there is no evidence suggesting a causal relationship between acute kidney injury and erythromycin exposure. NA."
", there is no direct causal relationship between acute kidney injury and liraglutide exposure. Animal studies and clinical trials have not shown liraglutide to be nephrotoxic. However, postmarketing reports have indicated cases of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure in some patients treated with liraglutide, but these events were often associated with other factors like dehydration or concomitant medications affecting renal function. Reversal of altered renal function has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide."
" from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, there is no evidence suggesting a causal relationship between telavancin and acute kidney injury. In both the HABP/VABP trials and the cSSSI trials, renal adverse events were more likely to occur in patients with baseline comorbidities predisposing them to kidney dysfunction, and no specific evidence links telavancin directly to acute kidney injury."
" from clinical trials and studies, there is no evidence suggesting a causal relationship between telavancin and acute kidney injury."
", there is evidence refuting a causal relationship between acute liver injury and acarbose. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance data show that treatment-emergent elevations of liver enzymes with acarbose were similar to placebo, and there were no significant differences in serum transaminase elevations between acarbose-treated patients and placebo-treated patients."
The evidence does not establish a causal relationship between acute liver injury and haloperidol exposure.
"Based on clinical trials involving over 7,000 patients, there is no evidence of serious drug-associated hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, with levofloxacin exposure. Severe hepatotoxicity cases reported post-marketing were not detected in these trials."
", a causal relationship between acute liver injury and peginterferon alfa-2a cannot be definitively established. However, chronic hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis treated with alpha interferons, including PEGASYS, may be at risk of hepatic decompensation and death, indicating a potential association with liver-related adverse events."
", there is no clear causal relationship between acute liver injury and pioglitazone. Postmarketing reports mention hepatic effects, but controlled clinical trials of pioglitazone hydrochloride have not shown evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity."
", there is no known causal relationship between acute liver injury and rivastigmine exposure. Clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance have not shown a significant association between rivastigmine use and acute liver injury."
The evidence refutes a causal relationship between acute liver injury and sildenafil use. Post-marketing reports and observational studies do not support this association. NA.
"The available data from observational studies and controlled clinical trials show inconsistency, and evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of myocardial infarction is inconclusive."
"Based on the provided context, there have been postmarketing reports of acute myocardial infarction in patients on therapy with acitretin. However, no causal relationship has been established between acute myocardial infarction and acitretin exposure."
" from clinical trials and warnings, a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and alvimopan has not been established. In short-term trials with alvimopan, no increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed. However, there was a greater incidence of myocardial infarction in alvimopan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients in a 12-month clinical trial, but the causal relationship remains unestablished."
The evidence refutes a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and avanafil.
The evidence refutes a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and avanafil use.
"Clinical trials and epidemiologic studies have not definitively established a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and methyltestosterone use in men. The evidence regarding major adverse cardiovascular events with testosterone replacement therapy, including myocardial infarction, remains inconclusive."
" from well-controlled, randomized trials, immediate-release nifedipine did not show any benefit in patients who had just sustained myocardial infarctions. In fact, in some trials, patients who received immediate-release nifedipine had significantly worse outcomes. Therefore, there is evidence refuting a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and nifedipine exposure."
" from clinical trials (Study 5) and the SSc-ILD study (Study 4), there were no cases of myocardial infarction in patients treated with OFEV compared to placebo-treated patients. Therefore, there is evidence refuting a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and nintedanib exposure."
" from clinical trials (Study 5) and the SSc-ILD study (Study 4), there were no cases of myocardial infarction in patients treated with OFEV compared to placebo-treated patients. Therefore, there is evidence refuting a causal relationship between acute myocardial infarction and nintedanib exposure."
" from seven controlled trials, there were six serious adverse events of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with repaglinide tablets plus NPH-insulin, suggesting a potential association. However, it is important to note that repaglinide tablets are not indicated for use in combination with NPH-insulin, indicating a lack of direct evidence refuting the relationship between acute myocardial infarction and repaglinide alone."
", a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of an oral JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, in RA patients showed a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to TNF blockers. This included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke. Patients with a history of these events or who are smokers are at additional risk. Lipid elevations have also been associated with ruxolitinib treatment. Therefore, evidence supports a potential relationship between ruxolitinib exposure and adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction."
", some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with the use of testosterone replacement therapy. Therefore, there is evidence suggesting a potential relationship between acute myocardial infarction and testosterone exposure."
"There is evidence that the concurrent use of aspirin and celecoxib increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events. However, there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use."
"Clinical studies of galantamine have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, there is evidence refuting a causal relationship between gastrointestinal bleeding and galantamine exposure."
"There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious GI thrombotic events associated with NSAID use, including piroxicam. The concurrent use of aspirin and piroxicam increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal events."
