0,Acute liver injury,lamotrigine,1,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting the causal association between lamotrigine and acute liver injury. However, they do suggest that dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, indicating a recognition of the drug's hepatic metabolism and potential impact on liver function. Clinical pharmacology studies recommend reducing the initial, escalation, and maintenance doses by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and by 50% in those with severe liver impairment with ascites."
1,Acute liver injury,nefazodone,1,"Evidence suggests a causal association between nefazodone and acute liver injury, with reported cases of life-threatening hepatic failure in patients, occurring at a rate approximately 3 to 4 times higher than the estimated background rate of liver failure. The risk of liver failure with nefazodone treatment is likely underestimated due to underreporting, and liver injury typically manifests within 2 weeks to 6 months of therapy initiation. Despite a large cohort study finding no cases of liver failure leading to death or transplant among nefazodone users, the data does not provide a precise risk estimate, and patients with signs of liver dysfunction are advised to discontinue nefazodone immediately."
2,Acute liver injury,tolcapone,1,"The evidence supporting the causal association between tolcapone and acute liver injury includes postmarketing reports of severe hepatocellular injury, including fulminant liver failure resulting in death, with an incidence potentially 10- to 100-fold higher than the background incidence in the general population. These severe adverse events were primarily reported within the first six months of treatment initiation. Consequently, monitoring liver enzymes (SGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST) is strongly recommended before and periodically during treatment, with immediate discontinuation of tolcapone if levels exceed twice the upper limit of normal or if clinical signs of liver dysfunction emerge."
3,Acute liver injury,Neostigmine,0,"Current evidence does not directly link neostigmine with acute liver injury; however, the pharmacokinetics of neostigmine in patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied, and it is metabolized by liver enzymes, suggesting that its concentration may increase in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, while no dosing adjustments are recommended for hepatic insufficiency, careful monitoring is advised due to the potential for prolonged effects, especially when used with hepatically cleared neuromuscular blocking agents."
4,Acute liver injury,Nortriptyline,1,I don't know.
5,Acute liver injury,Interferon beta-1a,1,"Evidence from postmarketing reports indicates that severe liver injury, including hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation, has been rarely reported in patients taking Interferon beta-1a (REBIF). Symptoms of liver dysfunction typically emerged one to six months after treatment initiation, and immediate discontinuation of REBIF is recommended if jaundice or other liver dysfunction symptoms appear. Asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases is common, and caution is advised when initiating treatment in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those on potentially hepatotoxic medications."
6,Acute liver injury,Phentermine,0,I don't know.
7,Acute liver injury,Disulfiram,1,I don't know.
8,Acute liver injury,Droperidol,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between Droperidol and acute liver injury. The adverse reactions detailed primarily concern QT prolongation, serious arrhythmias like torsade de pointes, and other cardiovascular and neurological effects. There is no mention of hepatotoxicity or liver injury in the context of Droperidol use."
9,Acute liver injury,Carbamazepine,1,"Carbamazepine has been associated with hepatic side effects, and its use may lead to newly occurring or worsening liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, particularly in the context of active liver disease. Clinical judgment dictates discontinuation of the drug if liver-related adverse reactions are evident. Monitoring liver function tests is recommended to detect potential liver injury in patients on carbamazepine therapy."
10,Acute liver injury,orlistat,1,"There have been rare postmarketing reports of severe liver injury, including hepatocellular necrosis or acute hepatic failure, in patients treated with orlistat (XENICAL), with some cases resulting in liver transplant or death. Patients are advised to report symptoms of liver dysfunction and discontinue orlistat if such symptoms occur, with immediate liver function tests to be conducted. However, a definitive causal relationship between orlistat and acute liver injury has not been established."
11,Acute liver injury,Valproate,1,"Valproate has been associated with acute liver injury, as indicated by the presence of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in the boxed warnings and precautions sections of its labeling. Clinical trials and post-marketing experiences have identified liver injury, including fatal cases, particularly in children under the age of two and in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The causal association is supported by the drug's labeling, reported adverse reactions, and the known hepatotoxic potential of valproate."
12,Acute liver injury,Primidone,0,I don't know.
13,Acute liver injury,lithium citrate,0,I don't know.
14,Acute liver injury,felbamate,1,"The evidence suggests a strong causal association between felbamate and acute liver injury, with approximately 67% of reported cases resulting in death or liver transplantation, often within 5 weeks of symptom onset. The earliest severe hepatic dysfunction was observed 3 weeks after felbamate initiation, and while prodromal symptoms like dark urine, anorexia, and malaise were reported in some cases, their presence was not consistent across all reports. Monitoring of serum transaminase levels is recommended to detect drug-induced hepatic injury early, and felbamate should be discontinued if liver enzyme levels significantly increase or clinical signs of liver failure are observed."
15,Acute liver injury,Clozapine,1,"Clozapine has been associated with eosinophilia, which can occur during the first month of treatment and has been linked to hepatitis, among other organ-specific diseases, suggesting a potential causal relationship with acute liver injury. This association may be indicative of a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), warranting prompt evaluation and possible discontinuation of clozapine if systemic disease is suspected. However, the provided context does not offer direct evidence of a causal link between clozapine and acute liver injury, but rather an association with eosinophilia that can accompany liver involvement."
16,Acute liver injury,Methenamine,0,"There is limited evidence suggesting a potential causal association between methenamine and acute liver injury, as indicated by a report of slightly elevated serum transaminase levels in a few instances during treatment with methenamine hippurate, which normalized while patients continued the medication. It is recommended that liver function studies be performed periodically on patients taking methenamine, especially those with pre-existing liver dysfunction."
17,Acute liver injury,Miconazole,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between Miconazole and acute liver injury. However, caution is advised when administering Miconazole, particularly in the form of ORAVIG, to patients with hepatic impairment due to its metabolism by the liver. The documents focus on Itraconazole, which has been associated with serious hepatotoxicity, but this information cannot be directly extrapolated to Miconazole without specific clinical data."
18,Acute liver injury,oxybutynin,0,"There is no direct information provided in the context regarding the causal association between oxybutynin and acute liver injury. The documents provided discuss pioglitazone hydrochloride and its potential link to bladder cancer and liver test abnormalities, as well as the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors, but they do not mention oxybutynin or its association with liver injury. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to summarize the evidence supporting the causal association between oxybutynin and acute liver injury."
19,Acute liver injury,Nitrofurantoin,1,"Nitrofurantoin has been associated with rare occurrences of acute liver injury, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, with some cases being fatal. The onset may be insidious, and monitoring for liver function changes is recommended; if hepatitis occurs, immediate withdrawal of the drug and appropriate measures are necessary. This information is supported by clinical trial data, postmarketing experience, and warnings included in medical documentation."
20,Acute liver injury,Hyoscyamine,0,I don't know.
21,Acute liver injury,Dicyclomine,0,I don't know.
22,Acute liver injury,Acetazolamide,1,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between acetazolamide and acute liver injury. They focus on acetazolamide's potential to cause electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, and its interactions with other drugs, as well as its teratogenic effects in animals and potential hematologic reactions. Acute liver injury is not mentioned as an adverse event in the context of acetazolamide treatment."
23,Acute liver injury,infliximab,1,"Postmarketing data suggest a causal association between infliximab and acute liver injury, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis, as these adverse events have been identified in adult and pediatric patients during post-approval use of infliximab products. However, due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reports and the uncertain size of the population, the exact frequency and a definitive causal relationship are challenging to establish. Additionally, methodological limitations in studies, such as uncontrolled concomitant medication use and lack of disease severity assessment, hinder the interpretation of these findings."
24,Acute liver injury,Flavoxate,0,"There is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to Flavoxate in the provided documents. The listed adverse reactions include gastrointestinal, CNS, hematologic, cardiovascular, allergic, ophthalmic, and renal effects, but liver injury is not described, suggesting a lack of sufficient data to establish a causal association between Flavoxate and acute liver injury."
25,Acute liver injury,Scopolamine,0,I don't know.
26,Acute liver injury,Ketotifen,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Ketotifen, specifically ACUVUE® Theravision™ with Ketotifen, and acute liver injury. The provided documents focus on the lack of systemic absorption of ocularly administered Ketotifen, its use during pregnancy and lactation, and pediatric and geriatric use, without mentioning liver injury. Additionally, the context includes information on pioglitazone hydrochloride and its potential liver-related adverse effects, which is not related to Ketotifen."
27,Acute liver injury,Lactulose,0,I don't know.
28,Acute liver injury,Sucralfate,0,"The provided documents do not report acute liver injury as an adverse reaction to sucralfate. Adverse reactions in clinical trials were minor and rarely led to discontinuation of the drug, with constipation being the most frequent complaint. Post-marketing cases include hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, but there is no mention of acute liver injury in the context provided."
29,Acute liver injury,Tetrahydrocannabinol,0,I don't know.
30,Acute liver injury,Tolmetin,1,"The evidence for a causal association between Tolmetin and acute liver injury is suggested by reports of hepatitis and liver function abnormalities occurring in less than 1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or post-marketing, with a probable causal relationship. However, the exact incidence and mechanism remain less clear due to the low frequency of these events."
31,Acute liver injury,almotriptan,0,"The available postmarketing data and clinical trial information do not provide a direct causal association between almotriptan and acute liver injury; adverse reactions identified post-approval include various cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neurological events, but acute liver injury is not explicitly mentioned. The evidence for adverse reactions comes from voluntary reports with uncertain frequency and without established causality due to the spontaneous nature of reporting."
32,Acute liver injury,zafirlukast,1,"Evidence from post-marketing adverse event surveillance indicates a causal association between zafirlukast and acute liver injury, with reports of life-threatening hepatic failure, symptomatic hepatitis, and elevated liver enzymes in patients treated with the recommended dose. While most cases resolved after discontinuation of zafirlukast, there have been rare instances of fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver transplantation, and death. Liver function monitoring is advised, and zafirlukast should be discontinued if hepatic dysfunction is suspected."
33,Acute liver injury,Naproxen,1,"The evidence for a causal association between Naproxen and acute liver injury includes postmarketing reports of hepatitis and abnormal liver function tests, with some cases being fatal. However, due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertain size of the population, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of these adverse events or establish a definitive causal relationship to Naproxen exposure."
34,Acute liver injury,oxaprozin,1,"The evidence suggests a potential causal association between oxaprozin and acute liver injury, as indicated by the recommendation to monitor liver function in patients on long-term NSAID treatment, including oxaprozin, due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. Postmarketing experience has identified hepatitis as an adverse reaction, although the frequency and causal relationship to oxaprozin exposure are not reliably estimated. Patients are advised to discontinue oxaprozin if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop."
35,Acute liver injury,celecoxib,1,"Clinical trials and postmarketing reports indicate that celecoxib use is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity, with up to 15% of patients experiencing mild elevations in liver enzymes (ALT or AST less than three times ULN) and about 0.2% of patients showing notable elevations. Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver injury, are rare but have been reported. Patients should be informed of hepatotoxicity symptoms and celecoxib should be discontinued immediately if signs consistent with liver disease develop."
36,Acute liver injury,benzonatate,0,I don't know.
37,Acute liver injury,Ketorolac,1,"Evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicates that ketorolac tromethamine can lead to elevated liver enzymes and, in rare instances, liver failure. The causal association between ketorolac and acute liver injury is supported by its inclusion in adverse reactions and severe complications, which practitioners are cautioned to monitor, especially at higher doses and with inappropriate use."
38,Acute liver injury,salmeterol,0,"Clinical trials and postmarketing experience with salmeterol have reported transient elevations in hepatic enzymes in ≥1% of subjects, but these were not associated with clinically relevant changes or discontinuation from the trials. There is no direct evidence or specific mention of acute liver injury as an adverse event causally associated with salmeterol in the provided documents."
39,Acute liver injury,Ergotamine,0,"The provided context does not contain information about ergotamine and its association with acute liver injury. Instead, it discusses adverse reactions related to entecavir and pioglitazone hydrochloride, including exacerbations of hepatitis, lactic acidosis, and hepatomegaly with steatosis. Therefore, based on the given documents, there is no evidence to summarize regarding the causal association between ergotamine and acute liver injury."
40,Acute liver injury,Piroxicam,1,"Clinical trials have reported that approximately 1% of patients treated with NSAIDs, including piroxicam, experienced elevations in liver enzymes (ALT or AST) at three or more times the upper limit of normal. Additionally, rare cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, have been associated with piroxicam use. Patients should be informed of hepatotoxicity symptoms and piroxicam should be discontinued immediately if signs and symptoms of liver disease develop."
41,Acute liver injury,fluticasone,0,"The provided context does not contain information regarding the causal association between fluticasone and acute liver injury. Instead, it discusses pioglitazone hydrochloride and its potential liver-related adverse effects, as well as bladder cancer risks. Additionally, it mentions serious hepatotoxicity associated with itraconazole. Therefore, based on the given documents, there is no evidence to summarize regarding fluticasone and acute liver injury."
42,Acute liver injury,Allopurinol,1,"The evidence for a causal association between allopurinol and acute liver injury includes documented cases of reversible hepatotoxicity, with some patients experiencing asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminases. Patients are advised to monitor liver function and discontinue allopurinol if signs of liver injury, such as anorexia, weight loss, or pruritus, develop."
43,Acute liver injury,Ibuprofen,1,"There is a recognized risk of acute liver injury associated with ibuprofen use, as evidenced by the recommendation to discontinue ibuprofen in patients who develop clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease or abnormal liver test values. The causal relationship is supported by postmarketing surveillance and clinical studies, which necessitate monitoring liver function during ibuprofen therapy, especially in cases where systemic manifestations like eosinophilia and rash occur, indicating a more severe hepatic reaction."
44,Acute liver injury,Indomethacin,1,"Clinical trials have reported that approximately 1% of patients treated with NSAIDs, including indomethacin, experienced elevations of liver enzymes (ALT or AST) to more than three times the upper limit of normal, with rare cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Additionally, up to 15% of patients may experience lesser elevations of liver enzymes. These findings, along with the recommendation to discontinue indomethacin immediately if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop, support a causal association between indomethacin and acute liver injury."
45,Acute liver injury,Etodolac,1,"The evidence for a causal association between Etodolac and acute liver injury is suggested by postmarketing reports of elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic failure, and liver necrosis. However, these adverse reactions have an incidence of less than 1% and are not commonly observed in clinical trials, indicating that while there is a potential risk, it is rare and the causal relationship is not fully established."
46,Acute liver injury,Sulindac,1,"Evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing reports indicates that sulindac, like other NSAIDs, can cause hepatic side effects ranging from mild liver test abnormalities to rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice, fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Borderline elevations of liver enzymes occur in up to 15% of patients taking sulindac, with less than 1% experiencing significant elevations. Patients presenting with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction while on sulindac therapy should be evaluated for more severe hepatic reactions, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if liver test abnormalities persist or worsen."
47,Acute liver injury,imatinib,1,"The evidence supporting the causal association between imatinib and acute liver injury includes reports of hepatotoxicity, occasionally severe, with both short-term and long-term use of imatinib mesylate. Cases of fatal liver failure and severe liver injury requiring liver transplants have been reported, and monitoring of liver function is recommended before and during treatment, with management involving imatinib mesylate interruption and/or dose reduction as needed. Increased liver enzymes (ALT and AST) were also observed in clinical trials, indicating potential liver injury."
48,Acute liver injury,Methotrexate,1,"Methotrexate has been associated with hepatotoxicity, which may manifest as fibrosis or cirrhosis, particularly in patients with psoriasis and those with heavy alcohol consumption. The risk of acute liver injury increases with the total cumulative dose, especially after a cumulative dose of 1.5 g or more. Liver function should be monitored regularly, and methotrexate should be withheld or discontinued if severe liver toxicity is observed."
49,Acute liver injury,Methyldopa,1,"Methyldopa has been associated with liver disorders, including hepatitis and jaundice, as well as abnormal liver function tests, which are listed under the WARNINGS section of its documentation. These hepatic adverse reactions are considered significant, though infrequent, and can potentially lead to fatal complications if not properly recognized and managed. The causal association is supported by the recommendation for periodic liver function tests during methyldopa therapy and the need for careful monitoring, with the implication that methyldopa may be discontinued if Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia or liver disorders occur."
50,Acute liver injury,Lisinopril,1,"Evidence suggests a causal association between Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, and acute liver injury, as ACE inhibitors have been linked to a syndrome that may start with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progress to fulminant hepatic necrosis, potentially leading to death. The exact mechanism of this syndrome is not fully understood, but patients who develop jaundice or significant elevations in hepatic enzymes while on Lisinopril are advised to discontinue the medication and seek medical treatment."
51,Acute liver injury,Adenosine,0,"There is no explicit mention of acute liver injury as an adverse event associated with adenosine in the provided documents. The adverse reactions listed for adenosine primarily involve cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal systems, with post-marketing experiences including arrhythmias and bronchospasm, but acute liver injury is not reported in the context of adenosine administration."
52,Acute liver injury,moexipril,1,"Evidence for the causal association between moexipril and acute liver injury is not explicitly established in the provided context. However, there are reports of elevated liver enzymes associated with moexipril hydrochloride administration, although these occurrences are rare and the causal relationship is unknown. The incidence of laboratory abnormalities, including those related to liver function, was similar between moexipril-treated patients and those receiving placebo."
53,Acute liver injury,Dacarbazine,1,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the causal association between Dacarbazine and acute liver injury. The documents focus on pioglitazone hydrochloride and its association with bladder cancer and liver test abnormalities, as well as adverse reactions to didanosine, including pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a summary of the evidence supporting the causal association between Dacarbazine and acute liver injury."
54,Acute liver injury,gemcitabine,1,"The evidence from clinical trials suggests that gemcitabine, particularly when used in combination with cisplatin, can lead to hepatic adverse events such as increased transaminases and increased alkaline phosphatase, which are indicative of liver injury. These hepatic laboratory abnormalities occurred in a significant proportion of patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin, with increased transaminases observed in 22% and increased alkaline phosphatase in 19% of patients. However, the documents provided do not explicitly establish a direct causal relationship between gemcitabine and acute liver injury, and further investigation into the frequency and causality of such adverse events is warranted."
55,Acute liver injury,Nifedipine,1,I don't know.
56,Acute liver injury,bosentan,1,"Clinical studies and postmarketing surveillance indicate that bosentan (TRACLEER) is associated with hepatotoxicity, evidenced by at least a 3-fold upper limit of normal (ULN) elevation of liver aminotransferases (ALT and AST) in approximately 11% of patients, with some cases also presenting elevated bilirubin levels. Rare instances of unexplained hepatic cirrhosis and liver failure have been reported, particularly after prolonged use, where the contribution of bosentan could not be excluded. Monitoring liver aminotransferases prior to and monthly during treatment is recommended, and discontinuation of bosentan is advised if elevations are accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction or injury, or if bilirubin levels increase to ≥2×ULN."
57,Acute liver injury,Diltiazem,1,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting the causal association between Diltiazem and acute liver injury. Instead, they discuss adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities related to other drugs, such as didanosine and entecavir, with mentions of pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, and hepatic toxicity, but not specifically linking Diltiazem to acute liver injury. Therefore, based on the provided context, a causal association between Diltiazem and acute liver injury cannot be established."
58,Acute liver injury,quinapril,1,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence of a causal association between quinapril and acute liver injury. However, they mention that ACE inhibitors, the class of drugs to which quinapril belongs, have been rarely associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, sometimes resulting in death. Patients who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes while on ACE inhibitors should discontinue the medication and receive appropriate medical follow-up."
59,Acute liver injury,Busulfan,1,"Evidence indicates that high busulfan area under the curve (AUC) values are associated with an increased risk of Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease (HVOD), a form of acute liver injury, particularly in patients with prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplants. HVOD was diagnosed in 8% of patients treated with Busulfan Injection in a transplantation setting, with a 40% fatality rate among those cases, suggesting a significant causal association between busulfan and acute liver injury."
60,Acute liver injury,Ramipril,1,"Evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggests that ramipril administration can be associated with elevations of liver enzymes and rare cases of hepatic failure, indicating a potential causal relationship with acute liver injury. However, the exact causal relationships remain uncertain, with less than 0.2% of patients discontinuing treatment due to abnormal liver-function tests, and the context does not provide a definitive incidence rate or risk assessment for acute liver injury specifically."
61,Acute liver injury,Phentolamine,0,I don't know.
62,Acute liver injury,bortezomib,1,"The provided documents indicate that cases of acute liver failure, hepatitis, increases in liver enzymes, and hyperbilirubinemia have been reported in patients treated with bortezomib, particularly in those receiving multiple concomitant medications and with serious underlying medical conditions. Bortezomib therapy should be interrupted to assess reversibility of hepatic toxicity, with limited information available on the outcomes of rechallenging such patients. This suggests a potential causal association between bortezomib and acute liver injury, warranting close monitoring and caution in patients with pre-existing hepatic conditions or those on multiple medications."
63,Acute liver injury,Captopril,1,"The evidence suggests a rare but serious causal association between Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, and acute liver injury, characterized by a syndrome that may start with cholestatic jaundice and progress to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The exact mechanism of this adverse event is not well understood, and patients who develop jaundice or significant elevations in hepatic enzymes while on Captopril should discontinue the drug and receive prompt medical evaluation and follow-up."
64,Acute liver injury,Enalaprilat,1,"The evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors, including enalaprilat, have been rarely associated with a syndrome that may start with cholestatic jaundice and progress to fulminant hepatic necrosis, potentially leading to death. The exact mechanism of this adverse hepatic reaction is not well understood. Patients on enalaprilat who develop jaundice or significant elevations in hepatic enzymes should discontinue the drug and receive prompt medical evaluation and follow-up."
65,Acute liver injury,trandolapril,1,"The evidence suggests a potential causal association between trandolapril and acute liver injury, as indicated by occasional elevation of transaminases in 0.8% of patients and persistent increase in bilirubin in 0.2% of patients, with some cases leading to discontinuation of treatment due to elevated liver enzymes. These findings are consistent with known adverse effects of ACE inhibitors, which include hepatic side effects such as jaundice and hepatitis."
66,Acute liver injury,Flutamide,1,I don't know.
67,Acute liver injury,Tamoxifen,1,"Tamoxifen has been associated with various liver abnormalities, including changes in liver enzyme levels and, on rare occasions, severe liver issues such as fatty liver, cholestasis, hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, with some cases resulting in fatalities. The causal relationship between tamoxifen and acute liver injury is uncertain, but there have been instances of positive rechallenges and dechallenges reported, suggesting a potential link. In clinical trials, such as the NSABP P-1, few severe changes in liver function were observed in patients treated with tamoxifen compared to placebo."
68,Acute liver injury,Thioguanine,1,"Evidence supports a causal association between thioguanine and acute liver injury, particularly when used in maintenance or long-term continuous therapy, as it is associated with a high risk of liver toxicity manifesting as hepatic veno-occlusive disease or portal hypertension. Histopathological features of this toxicity include hepatoportal sclerosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, peliosis hepatitis, and periportal fibrosis, with reversal of symptoms upon drug withdrawal. Liver enzyme elevations are also reported but are not consistent indicators of toxicity."
69,Acute liver injury,Methimazole,1,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting the causal association between methimazole and acute liver injury. However, they do mention severe complications such as vasculitis, which can involve various organs, and the need for close monitoring of patients for signs of illness. Methimazole is also noted as the preferred antithyroid drug over propylthiouracil in pediatric patients due to reports of severe liver injury with the latter, suggesting a relative safety profile regarding hepatic effects."
70,Acute liver injury,Niacin,1,I don't know.
71,Acute liver injury,pioglitazone,1,"There is no strong evidence of a causal association between pioglitazone and acute liver injury in the provided clinical trial database; a specifically designed 3-year trial showed only 0.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone had ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, with no cases exhibiting the combination of ALT and bilirubin levels predictive of severe drug-induced liver injury. However, caution is advised when initiating pioglitazone in patients with abnormal liver tests, and treatment should be interrupted if patients develop liver test abnormalities indicative of liver injury during therapy."
72,Acute liver injury,Propylthiouracil,1,"Evidence from voluntary reports and clinical documentation indicates that propylthiouracil is associated with severe liver injury, including hepatitis, liver failure necessitating liver transplantation, or resulting in death, particularly within the first six months of therapy. These adverse reactions have been observed in both adult and pediatric patients, with some cases being fatal or requiring liver transplantation, and are acknowledged in the drug's warnings, although a precise frequency or causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the nature of voluntary reporting."
73,Acute liver injury,sitagliptin,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting the causal association between sitagliptin and acute liver injury. Instead, they discuss the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin in pediatric use, its excretion in lactating rats, and considerations for use in geriatric patients and those with renal impairment. Additionally, there is extensive information on pioglitazone hydrochloride, including its potential association with bladder cancer and liver test abnormalities, but this is not relevant to sitagliptin and acute liver injury. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no known knowledge of a causal association between sitagliptin and acute liver injury."
74,Acute liver injury,Tinidazole,0,I don't know.
75,Acute liver injury,Itraconazole,1,"Clinical trials and post-marketing reports have associated itraconazole with rare but serious hepatotoxicity, including cases of liver failure and death, some of which occurred in patients without pre-existing liver disease or significant underlying medical conditions. Abnormal hepatic function was reported in 3% of patients in clinical trials for systemic fungal infections, and elevated liver enzymes led to discontinuation of therapy in 4% of patients in toenail onychomycosis trials. Given these findings, monitoring liver function is recommended during itraconazole treatment, and the drug should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of liver disease develop."
76,Acute liver injury,posaconazole,1,"Clinical trials have reported hepatic reactions, including mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes and clinical hepatitis, associated with posaconazole use, which were generally reversible upon discontinuation. More severe hepatic reactions, such as cholestasis and hepatic failure sometimes resulting in death, have been observed, particularly in patients with serious underlying conditions and those receiving higher doses (800 mg daily) of Noxafil® oral suspension. Monitoring of liver tests is recommended at the start and during posaconazole therapy, with consideration for drug discontinuation if signs and symptoms of liver disease develop."
77,Acute liver injury,Lamivudine,1,"The evidence suggests that lamivudine, a nucleoside analogue, has been associated with lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, which can be fatal and are more frequently reported in women, with female sex and obesity as potential risk factors. Clinical or laboratory findings indicative of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, including hepatomegaly and steatosis even without significant transaminase elevations, warrant suspension of lamivudine treatment. Additionally, postmarketing experiences have identified lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis as adverse reactions potentially linked to lamivudine, although causality is difficult to establish due to voluntary reporting from an unknown population size."
78,Acute liver injury,Zidovudine,1,"The use of zidovudine has been associated with hematologic toxicity, including severe anemia and neutropenia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, and there are reports of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, which can be fatal. Zidovudine is metabolized by the liver, and concentrations may be increased in patients with impaired hepatic function, potentially increasing the risk of hematologic toxicity; however, there are insufficient data to recommend dose adjustments in these patients. Acute liver injury is not explicitly listed among the adverse events following zidovudine overdose, but the drug's association with severe hepatomegaly with steatosis suggests a potential for hepatotoxicity."
79,Acute liver injury,voriconazole,1,"Clinical trials and post-marketing data suggest a causal association between voriconazole and acute liver injury, with evidence of increased transaminase levels (>3x ULN) in 17.7% of adult subjects in pooled clinical trials. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with serious hepatic toxicity, including jaundice, hepatitis, and rare cases of hepatic failure leading to death, particularly in patients with serious underlying conditions. Monitoring of liver function tests is recommended at the start and during therapy, with consideration for discontinuation if signs and symptoms of liver disease attributable to voriconazole develop."
80,Acute liver injury,gemifloxacin,1,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between gemifloxacin and acute liver injury. However, they do mention increased liver enzymes (ALT and AST) as infrequent drug-related adverse events, which could suggest potential hepatotoxicity at a low frequency. Clinical monitoring for liver-related adverse effects is implied in the precautions due to the potential for increased liver enzymes."
81,Acute liver injury,Caspofungin,1,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the causal association between Caspofungin and acute liver injury. Instead, it discusses adverse reactions and hepatotoxicity related to Itraconazole and Posaconazole, which are different antifungal medications. Therefore, based on the given documents, I cannot provide a summary of the evidence supporting the causal association between Caspofungin and acute liver injury."
82,Acute liver injury,Didanosine,1,"There is a documented causal association between didanosine and acute liver injury, including lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, which can be fatal. These adverse events have been reported in patients using didanosine alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals, with an increased risk in women, obese individuals, and those with prolonged nucleoside exposure. Cases of hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure, and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have also been reported, leading to recommendations for cautious use, monitoring, and potential discontinuation of didanosine in patients with liver disease or signs of liver injury."
83,Acute liver injury,Paromomycin,0,I don't know.
84,Acute liver injury,Penicillin V,0,"The provided documents do not contain information on Penicillin V and its association with acute liver injury. Instead, they discuss adverse reactions related to other drugs, such as didanosine and entecavir, with mentions of pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, and hepatomegaly with steatosis, but not acute liver injury specifically linked to Penicillin V. Therefore, based on the provided context, a causal association between Penicillin V and acute liver injury cannot be established."
85,Acute liver injury,abacavir,1,"The provided documents do not contain specific information regarding the causal association between abacavir and acute liver injury. However, they do mention that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, which can include liver-related adverse events, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues like abacavir. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for these conditions in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues, and treatment with abacavir should be suspended if clinical or laboratory findings suggest lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity."
86,Acute liver injury,tipranavir,1,"Clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including fatalities, have been reported with tipranavir (APTIVUS) co-administered with ritonavir, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and multiple medications, though a causal relationship has not been established. Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C or elevated transaminases are at increased risk for hepatotoxicity, with studies showing a significant percentage developing Grade 3 or 4 hepatic transaminase elevations. Tipranavir is metabolized by the liver, and caution is advised when prescribing to patients with hepatic impairment due to potential increased drug concentrations."
87,Acute liver injury,efavirenz,1,"Evidence from clinical trials suggests a causal association between efavirenz and acute liver injury, particularly in patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C. Elevations in liver enzymes (AST and ALT) were observed more frequently in patients treated with efavirenz-containing regimens compared to control arms, with some patients discontinuing due to liver or biliary system disorders. This association is supported by postmarketing experiences, although the exact frequency and causal relationship are harder to establish due to voluntary reporting from an unknown population size."
88,Acute liver injury,terbinafine,1,"The evidence supporting the causal association between terbinafine and acute liver injury includes documented cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, in patients with and without preexisting liver disease, as well as reports of hepatitis, cholestasis, and increased hepatic enzymes. Terbinafine tablets are contraindicated for patients with chronic or active liver disease, and liver function tests are recommended before and during treatment, with the advice to discontinue use if liver injury develops. The severity of hepatic events may be worse in patients with underlying liver disease, and patients are warned to report symptoms indicative of liver injury immediately."
89,Acute liver injury,Levofloxacin,1,"Evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing experience indicates that severe hepatotoxicity, which can lead to acute liver injury, has been reported with the use of levofloxacin, particularly in the geriatric population aged 65 years or older. The causal association is supported by these reports, but the exact frequency and mechanism remain less clearly defined due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reports and the presence of confounding factors."
90,Acute liver injury,Erythromycin,1,I don't know.
91,Acute liver injury,Fluconazole,1,"The evidence suggests a rare but serious causal association between fluconazole and acute liver injury, with clinical trials and post-marketing experience reporting instances of mild transient elevations in liver enzymes, clinical hepatitis, cholestasis, and fulminant hepatic failure, sometimes resulting in fatalities. These adverse hepatic reactions were more frequently observed in patients with severe underlying conditions, such as AIDS or cancer, and were often taking multiple concomitant medications. Liver function typically returned to baseline upon discontinuation of fluconazole."
92,Acute liver injury,darunavir,1,"There is evidence of drug-induced hepatitis, including acute hepatitis and cytolytic hepatitis, associated with darunavir/ritonavir use, with a reported incidence of hepatitis in 0.5% of patients during clinical trials. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, some fatal, have been reported, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, co-morbidities such as hepatitis B or C co-infection, or those experiencing immune reconstitution syndrome; however, a direct causal relationship with darunavir/ritonavir therapy has not been definitively established. Monitoring liver function before and during therapy is recommended, especially in patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction or elevated transaminases."
93,Acute liver injury,Rifampin,1,"Clinical studies and postmarketing reports have associated the use of rifampin with hepatotoxicity, including transient abnormalities in liver function tests, hepatitis, hepatic involvement with a shock-like syndrome, and cholestasis. However, due to the voluntary nature of many of these reports and the uncertain size of the population, it is challenging to reliably estimate the frequency of these adverse events or establish a definitive causal relationship to rifampin exposure."
94,Acute liver injury,Griseofulvin,0,"Post-marketing reports and the provided documentation indicate that griseofulvin use has been associated with severe hepatic adverse events, including hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and jaundice, which may necessitate hospitalization or lead to death. Patients on griseofulvin should be monitored for hepatic adverse events, and the drug should be discontinued if serious hepatotoxicity is suspected."
95,Acute liver injury,Stavudine,1,"Evidence from postmarketing surveillance indicates that stavudine use, particularly in combination with hydroxyurea and didanosine, is associated with hepatotoxicity and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, especially in HIV-infected patients with preexisting liver dysfunction or significant underlying liver disease. The coadministration of stavudine with didanosine is contraindicated due to the risk of fatal hepatic events, and the combination with hydroxyurea should be avoided. Monitoring for liver function abnormalities is recommended, and treatment discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of worsening liver disease."
96,Acute liver injury,isoniazid,1,"Evidence indicates a causal association between isoniazid and acute liver injury, with increased risk factors including daily alcohol use, chronic liver disease, and certain demographics such as women, particularly black and Hispanic women in the postpartum period. Hepatitis associated with isoniazid can be severe and sometimes fatal, with the risk of liver damage being age-related and higher among those with pre-existing liver conditions or certain lifestyle factors. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended, and if significant abnormalities are detected, discontinuation of isoniazid should be strongly considered."
97,Acute liver injury,gatifloxacin,0,I don't know.
98,Acute liver injury,Ciprofloxacin,1,"Evidence from clinical trials and postmarketing experience suggests a causal association between ciprofloxacin and acute liver injury, as hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has been reported. Laboratory changes indicative of hepatotoxicity, such as elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and serum bilirubin, have been observed in patients on ciprofloxacin. However, due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reports, the exact frequency and establishment of a causal relationship to drug exposure are not always reliable."
99,Acute liver injury,Cyclosporine,1,"The evidence from clinical studies and adverse reaction reports suggests that acute liver injury is a rare but recognized adverse event associated with cyclosporine use, occurring in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials involving kidney, heart, and liver transplants. Routine monitoring of liver function is recommended in patients receiving cyclosporine, indicating a known risk of hepatotoxicity. The causal association is supported by the need for dosage adjustments in the presence of liver function impairment and the drug's extensive metabolism by hepatic enzymes."
100,Acute liver injury,Penicillamine,1,"The evidence from clinical trials and reported adverse reactions indicates that penicillamine therapy can lead to hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, intraheptic cholestasis, and toxic hepatitis, although these events are considered rare. The association between penicillamine and acute liver injury is supported by isolated cases and reports of hepatic enzyme alterations, but the overall incidence is not quantified in the provided documents."
101,Acute kidney injury,Thiothixene,0,"The provided documents do not report acute kidney injury as an adverse reaction to thiothixene. They detail various other side effects, including cardiovascular, CNS effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, and hematologic effects, but there is no mention of acute kidney injury specifically associated with thiothixene use. Therefore, based on the given context, there is no evidence supporting a causal association between thiothixene and acute kidney injury."
102,Acute kidney injury,Methocarbamol,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between methocarbamol and acute kidney injury; instead, they list various adverse reactions such as anaphylactic reactions, dyspepsia, jaundice, leukopenia, and hypersensitivity reactions, among others. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned as a known adverse reaction in the context of methocarbamol administration according to the available documents."
103,Acute kidney injury,Neostigmine,0,"Current evidence does not directly associate neostigmine with acute kidney injury (AKI); however, its elimination half-life is prolonged in patients with renal impairment, suggesting that neostigmine concentrations may increase in such individuals. No specific dosing adjustments are recommended for renal function impairment, but close and extended monitoring is advised, particularly to ensure that the effects of any neuromuscular blocking agents, especially those cleared by the kidneys, do not outlast those of neostigmine."
104,Acute kidney injury,Nortriptyline,0,I don't know.
105,Acute kidney injury,Phentermine,0,"Current evidence suggests that phentermine is substantially excreted by the kidneys, and its exposure increases in patients with renal impairment, warranting caution in dose selection and administration, especially in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m^2). However, there is no direct mention of acute kidney injury as an adverse event in the provided documents, indicating a lack of established causal association between phentermine and acute kidney injury in the available literature."
106,Acute kidney injury,Disulfiram,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between Disulfiram and acute kidney injury. They focus on hepatic toxicity, including hepatic failure, and other adverse reactions such as optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, and the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned as a known adverse event in the context of Disulfiram use."
107,Acute kidney injury,orlistat,0,"Current evidence does not establish a direct causal relationship between orlistat and acute kidney injury; however, orlistat has been associated with oxalate nephrolithiasis and oxalate nephropathy, which can lead to renal failure. Patients treated with orlistat who are at risk for renal insufficiency should have their renal function monitored, and orlistat should be discontinued if oxalate nephropathy develops."
108,Acute kidney injury,Primidone,0,I don't know.
109,Acute kidney injury,Prochlorperazine,0,I don't know.
110,Acute kidney injury,Imipramine,0,I don't know.
111,Acute kidney injury,metaxalone,0,I don't know.
112,Acute kidney injury,ramelteon,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between ramelteon and acute kidney injury. The documents focus on the effects of ramelteon on balance, mobility, memory, and respiratory parameters in various populations, including those with COPD and sleep apnea, and mention that no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment, indicating no significant renal effects were observed."
113,Acute kidney injury,Chlorazepate,0,I don't know.
114,Acute kidney injury,Clozapine,0,"Clozapine has been associated with acute interstitial nephritis, which can lead to renal failure, as documented in the provided context. This adverse event is part of the spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions and organ-specific toxicities that can occur with clozapine treatment, and it may necessitate discontinuation of the medication and appropriate medical intervention."
115,Acute kidney injury,Temazepam,0,I don't know.
116,Acute kidney injury,Methenamine,0,"The provided documents do not contain specific information regarding the causal association between Methenamine and acute kidney injury. They primarily discuss the renal effects and interactions of ketorolac tromethamine with other drugs, as well as its potential adverse effects on renal function when used during pregnancy or with certain medications. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a summary of the evidence supporting the causal association between Methenamine and acute kidney injury."
117,Acute kidney injury,Urea,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between urea and acute kidney injury (AKI); instead, they report that increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, which are markers of renal function, were observed in a small percentage of patients treated with ACE inhibitors like quinapril and lisinopril, particularly when used in conjunction with diuretic therapy. These increases were often reversible upon continuation of therapy or adjustment of diuretic dosage, suggesting a potential for renal function compromise, which could lead to AKI under certain circumstances, rather than a direct causative relationship between urea itself and AKI."
118,Acute kidney injury,Miconazole,0,"There is evidence of a causal association between voriconazole and acute kidney injury, as acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole, particularly those who may also be receiving nephrotoxic medications or have pre-existing conditions affecting renal function. Monitoring of renal function, including serum creatinine, is recommended during voriconazole therapy."
119,Acute kidney injury,darifenacin,0,I don't know.
120,Acute kidney injury,Hyoscyamine,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between hyoscyamine and acute kidney injury. However, they do mention that hyoscyamine sulfate is substantially excreted by the kidney and that the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, indicating a need for cautious dose selection and potential monitoring of renal function in such patients."
121,Acute kidney injury,Dicyclomine,0,"The available evidence does not establish a direct causal relationship between dicyclomine and acute kidney injury; however, caution is advised when administering dicyclomine to patients with renal impairment, as the drug is substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in this population. Clinical trials and postmarketing experiences have not specifically reported acute kidney injury as an adverse event associated with dicyclomine."
122,Acute kidney injury,infliximab,0,"The provided documents primarily discuss the immunogenicity of infliximab, including the development of anti-drug antibodies and their potential impact on drug efficacy and infusion reactions, but do not directly address the causal association between infliximab and acute kidney injury. Therefore, based on the given context, there is no evidence presented here to support a causal relationship between infliximab and acute kidney injury. Additional research and clinical data would be required to establish such an association."
123,Acute kidney injury,Prilocaine,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between prilocaine and acute kidney injury. They focus on the risk of methemoglobinemia, systemic toxicity, and interactions with other drugs that may lead to methemoglobinemia when used concurrently with prilocaine. There is mention of prilocaine potentially increasing creatine phosphokinase levels, which could interfere with diagnostic tests for acute myocardial infarction, but no direct link to acute kidney injury is provided in the context."
124,Acute kidney injury,Flavoxate,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between Flavoxate and acute kidney injury. The adverse reactions listed for Flavoxate include dysuria, but acute kidney injury is not mentioned. Additionally, there are no data on the frequency of the observed adverse reactions, which limits the ability to establish a causal relationship."
125,Acute kidney injury,Scopolamine,0,I don't know.
126,Acute kidney injury,Hydrochlorothiazide,1,"Hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with renal adverse reactions such as renal failure, renal dysfunction, and interstitial nephritis, which may manifest in patients with impaired renal function and could potentially precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI). The drug's cumulative effects may develop in such patients, leading to azotemia, especially when there is pre-existing renal disease. This causal association is supported by postmarketing experience and warnings in the medical literature, although the exact frequency of AKI related to hydrochlorothiazide use is not reliably estimated due to voluntary reporting."
127,Acute kidney injury,Ketoconazole,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between Ketoconazole, specifically in its topical cream form, and acute kidney injury. The adverse reactions listed for Ketoconazole Cream 2% mainly include severe irritation, pruritus, stinging, and rare reports of contact dermatitis, with no mention of acute kidney injury. Hepatitis and effects on hormone levels have been observed with oral administration, but these are not linked to the topical application of the drug."
128,Acute kidney injury,Ketotifen,0,"The provided context discusses the use of NSAIDs, specifically ketorolac tromethamine, and its potential adverse effects on fetal and neonatal renal function when used during pregnancy, particularly after 20 weeks gestation. However, there is no direct evidence or mention of ketotifen, a different medication, being associated with acute kidney injury in the provided documents. Therefore, based on the given context, a causal association between ketotifen and acute kidney injury cannot be established."
129,Acute kidney injury,Lactulose,0,"Current evidence does not directly associate lactulose with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, excessive dosage leading to diarrhea can result in complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia, which are conditions that can indirectly contribute to AKI. Regular monitoring of serum electrolytes is recommended for elderly, debilitated patients on long-term lactulose therapy to prevent such complications."
130,Acute kidney injury,Chlorothiazide,1,"The provided documents do not directly address the causal association between Chlorothiazide and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). However, they mention that Chlorothiazide is substantially excreted by the kidney and that the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, suggesting a potential for renal adverse effects. Additionally, renal dysfunction and interstitial nephritis are listed as possible adverse reactions to hydrochlorothiazide, a related thiazide diuretic, which may imply a class effect that could include AKI. Monitoring renal function is advised, especially in the elderly or those with existing renal impairment."
131,Acute kidney injury,Tetrahydrocannabinol,0,I don't know.
132,Acute kidney injury,almotriptan,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided context that establishes a causal relationship between almotriptan and acute kidney injury. The documents focus on the treatment of almotriptan overdose, postmarketing adverse reactions without frequency estimation or established causality, and warnings about cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and gastrointestinal events, but do not mention acute kidney injury as a known adverse event."
133,Acute kidney injury,zafirlukast,0,I don't know.
134,Acute kidney injury,Naproxen,1,"Long-term use of NSAIDs like naproxen can lead to renal papillary necrosis and other renal injuries, particularly in patients with existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, or dehydration. Naproxen may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation, leading to decreased renal blood flow and potential acute kidney injury, with the greatest risk in vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those on diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy typically results in recovery to the pretreatment state, but there is no controlled clinical study data on the use of naproxen in patients with advanced renal disease."
135,Acute kidney injury,oxaprozin,1,"Postmarketing experiences with oxaprozin have identified acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and acute renal failure as adverse reactions, but due to the voluntary nature of these reports, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a definitive causal relationship to oxaprozin exposure. Additionally, the prescribing information warns of potential renal toxicity, advising monitoring renal function in at-risk patients and cautioning against use in those with advanced renal disease unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Therefore, while there is evidence suggesting an association between oxaprozin and acute kidney injury, causality is not conclusively established."
136,Acute kidney injury,Diflunisal,1,I don't know.
137,Acute kidney injury,benzonatate,0,I don't know.
138,Acute kidney injury,Ketorolac,1,"The provided documents do not directly address the causal association between Ketorolac and acute kidney injury. However, they do indicate that NSAIDs, including Ketorolac, can lead to renal impairment and should be used with caution in patients with compromised renal function or heart failure, conditions which are risk factors for acute kidney injury. Additionally, the documents mention that Ketorolac can affect renal prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a role in kidney function, suggesting a potential mechanism by which Ketorolac could contribute to acute kidney injury."
139,Acute kidney injury,bromfenac,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between bromfenac and acute kidney injury. Bromfenac, as a topical ophthalmic NSAID, is primarily associated with adverse reactions such as anterior chamber inflammation, headache, vitreous floaters, iritis, eye pain, and ocular hypertension, with no mention of systemic renal effects in the context provided."
140,Acute kidney injury,Ergotamine,0,I don't know.
141,Acute kidney injury,Piroxicam,1,"The evidence suggests a causal association between Piroxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with risk factors such as impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, and the elderly. Piroxicam can cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation leading to decreased renal blood flow and potential renal decompensation, with renal effects that may worsen preexisting renal disease. Monitoring of renal function is advised when using Piroxicam, especially in patients with underlying renal disease or risk factors, and its use should be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits outweigh the risks."
142,Acute kidney injury,meloxicam,1,"The evidence supporting the causal association between meloxicam and acute kidney injury includes documented renal toxicity such as renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure with long-term NSAID use, including meloxicam. Patients with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, and the elderly are at increased risk. Recovery is typically seen upon discontinuation of NSAID therapy, but meloxicam can exacerbate preexisting renal disease, and monitoring for worsening renal function is advised, especially in patients with advanced renal disease or other risk factors."
143,Acute kidney injury,Fenoprofen,1,"The evidence suggests that long-term use of fenoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can lead to renal papillary necrosis and other forms of renal injury, particularly in patients with existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, or dehydration. Fenoprofen may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and renal blood flow, potentially leading to acute kidney injury, especially in high-risk populations such as the elderly or those on diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy typically results in recovery to the pretreatment state."
144,Acute kidney injury,rizatriptan,0,"The provided documents do not report acute kidney injury as an observed adverse event associated with the administration of rizatriptan benzoate. The adverse events listed are categorized by frequency and body system, with no mention of renal or kidney-related side effects, suggesting that there is no direct evidence from these sources supporting a causal association between rizatriptan and acute kidney injury."
145,Acute kidney injury,Allopurinol,1,"Evidence from medical literature and product labeling indicates that treatment with allopurinol tablets may result in acute kidney injury, particularly due to the formation of xanthine calculi or precipitation of urates, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those receiving concomitant uricosuric agents. Patients at increased risk, such as those with chronic kidney disease or a history of kidney stones, should be closely monitored for kidney function, and adequate hydration should be maintained to minimize the risk."
146,Acute kidney injury,Ibuprofen,1,"The provided documents do not directly address the causal association between ibuprofen and acute kidney injury (AKI). However, they do mention that long-term use of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can lead to renal toxicity, particularly in patients with compromised renal function or those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy typically results in recovery to the pretreatment state, suggesting a potential reversible effect on renal function."
147,Acute kidney injury,Ketoprofen,1,"The evidence supporting the causal association between ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and acute kidney injury includes documented renal effects such as elevation of plasma lithium levels and reduction in renal lithium clearance due to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs. Additionally, NSAIDs like ketoprofen can increase the risk of renal impairment, especially when used concomitantly with medications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or in conditions like pregnancy where they may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and neonatal renal impairment."
148,Acute kidney injury,frovatriptan,0,"The provided documents do not report acute kidney injury as an observed adverse event associated with the administration of frovatriptan. The adverse events listed in clinical trials and postmarketing experience primarily include central and peripheral nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal issues, and cardiovascular reactions, but there is no mention of frovatriptan causing acute kidney injury. Therefore, based on the available documents, there is no evidence supporting a causal association between frovatriptan and acute kidney injury."
149,Acute kidney injury,eletriptan,0,"The provided documents do not contain any direct evidence or reports linking eletriptan to acute kidney injury. The adverse events associated with eletriptan, as mentioned in the documents, include cerebrovascular events, vasospasm reactions, medication overuse headache, serotonin syndrome, increased blood pressure, anaphylactic reactions, and various cardiac events, but acute kidney injury is not listed among the identified adverse reactions during post-approval use of eletriptan hydrobromide."
150,Acute kidney injury,Etodolac,1,"The evidence suggests that long-term use of NSAIDs like etodolac can lead to renal papillary necrosis and other renal injuries, particularly in patients with existing renal function impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Etodolac may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation, leading to decreased renal blood flow and potential acute kidney injury. Use of etodolac is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease, and if initiated, close monitoring of renal function is advised."
151,Acute kidney injury,Mefenamate,1,"The evidence suggests that mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can cause acute renal failure, which is a form of acute kidney injury (AKI), although such occurrences are rare. This association is supported by documented cases of renal effects following acute NSAID overdose, including mefenamic acid, where hypertension and acute renal failure have been observed. Additionally, NSAIDs can lead to a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in reduced renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation, particularly in patients with existing renal impairment or other risk factors."
152,Acute kidney injury,darbepoetin alfa,0,"The evidence from clinical trials does not directly associate darbepoetin alfa with acute kidney injury; instead, it highlights an increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia, particularly in those with a history of stroke or cancer. The TREAT trial showed nearly a two-fold increase in stroke risk with darbepoetin alfa treatment compared to placebo, but the primary endpoints related to renal outcomes, such as progression to end-stage renal disease, were not significantly affected by the drug."
153,Acute kidney injury,Lisinopril,1,"Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) as evidenced by symptomatic hypotension that may lead to oliguria, progressive azotemia, and acute renal failure, particularly in patients with risk factors such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or those on high dose diuretic therapy. Increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation, have been observed in patients with hypertension and heart failure treated with lisinopril, especially when used concomitantly with diuretics. Monitoring renal function is recommended, and caution is advised when initiating treatment in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those undergoing major surgery or anesthesia."
154,Acute kidney injury,Adenosine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents linking adenosine to acute kidney injury. The adverse reactions listed for adenosine in controlled U.S. clinical trials and post-marketing experience primarily involve cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal effects, without mention of renal complications such as acute kidney injury."
155,Acute kidney injury,moexipril,1,"Evidence suggests a causal association between moexipril, an ACE inhibitor, and acute kidney injury, particularly in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis. Increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, indicative of kidney injury, have been observed in some patients on moexipril, although these effects are typically reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Monitoring of renal function is recommended during the initial weeks of moexipril therapy, especially in patients with compromised renal function or those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy."
156,Acute kidney injury,Dacarbazine,0,I don't know.
157,Acute kidney injury,telmisartan,1,"The ONTARGET trial, which included patients with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, found that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) with telmisartan and ramipril led to an increased incidence of renal dysfunction, including acute renal failure, compared to monotherapy with either drug alone. Therefore, there is evidence supporting a causal association between telmisartan, particularly when used in combination with another RAS inhibitor, and acute kidney injury. It is recommended to avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors and to closely monitor renal function in patients on telmisartan."
158,Acute kidney injury,Phentolamine,0,I don't know.
159,Acute kidney injury,Captopril,1,"Clinical evidence suggests that the use of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, can be associated with acute kidney injury, particularly in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have compromised renal function, especially when used in combination with NSAIDs or other agents that affect the renin-angiotensin system. These adverse renal effects are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, and close monitoring of renal function is recommended in at-risk patients."
160,Acute kidney injury,Enalaprilat,1,"Clinical evidence suggests that enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, can cause changes in renal function, leading to oliguria, progressive azotemia, and in rare cases, acute renal failure, particularly in patients with severe heart failure or pre-existing renal impairment. These adverse effects are often reversible upon discontinuation of the drug and are more likely when enalaprilat is administered with a diuretic. Monitoring of renal function is recommended during the first few weeks of therapy, especially in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis or those with compromised renal function."
161,Acute kidney injury,candesartan,1,"Clinical evidence indicates that candesartan cilexetil, an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system, can lead to impaired renal function, including acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly in patients with conditions that make their renal function dependent on the renin-angiotensin system, such as those with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion. In the CHARM program, the incidence of abnormal renal function was higher in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil compared to placebo, and a similar trend was observed in the CHARM-Added program, suggesting a causal association between candesartan use and the development of AKI."
162,Acute kidney injury,Flutamide,0,I don't know.
163,Acute kidney injury,Chlorambucil,0,I don't know.
164,Acute kidney injury,Acarbose,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between acarbose and acute kidney injury; however, they do indicate that acarbose treatment resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of renal tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats at high doses. Long-term clinical trials in diabetic patients with significant renal dysfunction have not been conducted, and therefore, treatment with acarbose in patients with serum creatinine levels above 2.0 mg/dL is not recommended."
165,Acute kidney injury,Tinidazole,0,I don't know.
166,Acute kidney injury,Acyclovir,1,"The provided documents do not contain information on the causal association between Acyclovir and Acute kidney injury. They focus on voriconazole and celecoxib, discussing their potential renal side effects and monitoring recommendations, but do not mention Acyclovir. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot summarize the evidence for a causal association between Acyclovir and Acute kidney injury."
167,Acute kidney injury,entecavir,0,"The evidence for a causal association between entecavir and acute kidney injury is suggested by clinical trial data showing a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL in 11% of subjects treated with entecavir through Week 48, indicating potential renal impairment. Additionally, dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with renal impairment, and renal function must be monitored in liver transplant recipients receiving entecavir, especially when concomitant immunosuppressants known to affect renal function are used."
168,Acute kidney injury,Nelfinavir,0,"The provided documents do not contain direct evidence supporting a causal association between Nelfinavir and acute kidney injury. The adverse reactions detailed for Nelfinavir include diarrhea, peripheral neurologic symptoms/neuropathy, nausea, headache, rash, vomiting, and pancreatitis, but there is no mention of acute kidney injury in the context of Nelfinavir use."
169,Acute kidney injury,Paromomycin,0,I don't know.
170,Acute kidney injury,Penicillin V,0,I don't know.
171,Acute kidney injury,darunavir,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between darunavir and acute kidney injury; however, they mention renal and urinary disorders such as crystal nephropathy and crystalluria as potential adverse events. The evidence for a causal relationship with darunavir/ritonavir therapy in these renal conditions is not explicitly stated, and no specific mention of acute kidney injury is made in the context of darunavir use."
172,Acute kidney injury,Griseofulvin,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between griseofulvin and acute kidney injury; however, they do mention rare reports of proteinuria and nephrosis, which can be related to kidney function. These renal adverse events are occasionally associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, and the documents advise periodic monitoring of organ system function, including renal, during prolonged therapy with griseofulvin."
173,Acute kidney injury,gatifloxacin,0,I don't know.
174,Acute kidney injury,Mebendazole,0,"The provided documents do not report a clear association between mebendazole and acute kidney injury. They focus on the risk of birth defects and miscarriages in pregnant women, adverse developmental effects in animal studies, and other adverse reactions such as hematologic effects, hypersensitivity, and skin reactions. Acute kidney injury is not mentioned as an observed adverse event in the context of mebendazole use."
175,Acute kidney injury,Vitamin A,0,I don't know.
176,Acute kidney injury,Cyclosporine,1,"Clinical trials and postmarketing experience have demonstrated that cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive agent, is associated with renal toxicity, including acute kidney injury (AKI), with renal toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation in 5.4% of kidney transplant patients. Renal biopsies in rheumatoid arthritis patients revealed cyclosporine nephropathy in 10% of patients after an average treatment duration of 19 months, with serum creatinine improvement upon discontinuation in most cases. The risk of AKI increases with the dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy, necessitating frequent monitoring of renal function and adjustment of dosage to mitigate potential nephrotoxic effects."
177,Acute myocardial infarction,Thiothixene,0,I don't know.
178,Acute myocardial infarction,Methocarbamol,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between methocarbamol and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The listed adverse reactions for methocarbamol include various cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, flushing, hypotension, syncope, and thrombophlebitis, but AMI is not explicitly mentioned. Additional research and clinical data would be required to establish a link between methocarbamol use and the occurrence of AMI."
179,Acute myocardial infarction,Amoxapine,1,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between Amoxapine and Acute myocardial infarction (AMI); however, they do note that myocardial infarction has been reported with drugs in the same class as Amoxapine (tricyclic antidepressants). Patients with cardiovascular disorders are advised to be closely monitored when on tricyclic antidepressants due to potential cardiac side effects, including arrhythmias and changes in conduction time, which could theoretically contribute to the risk of AMI."
180,Acute myocardial infarction,Desipramine,1,"The provided documents do not directly link desipramine to acute myocardial infarction (AMI); however, they mention that seizures can precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in patients with a history of seizure disorder taking desipramine. Additionally, desipramine can block the antihypertensive effects of certain compounds, potentially increasing cardiovascular risk, and hypertensive episodes have been observed during surgery in patients on desipramine. These factors suggest a possible, albeit indirect, pathway through which desipramine might contribute to cardiovascular adverse events, including AMI, particularly in predisposed individuals."
181,Acute myocardial infarction,Nortriptyline,1,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between nortriptyline and acute myocardial infarction (AMI); however, they list myocardial infarction as a potential adverse reaction without specifying its frequency or establishing causality. The documents focus more on the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant serotonergic drugs, the unmasking of Brugada syndrome, and angle-closure glaucoma as concerns with nortriptyline use. Additional research and postmarketing surveillance data would be required to determine a definitive causal relationship between nortriptyline and AMI."
182,Acute myocardial infarction,Bromocriptine,1,I don't know.
183,Acute myocardial infarction,Droperidol,0,"Current evidence does not directly link droperidol to acute myocardial infarction; however, droperidol has been associated with QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmias like torsade de pointes, which can be fatal and may indirectly increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Cases have been reported even at or below recommended doses and in patients without known risk factors for QT prolongation. Therefore, a 12-lead ECG is recommended prior to administration to assess for prolonged QT intervals, and continuous ECG monitoring is advised if treatment is deemed necessary despite potential risks."
184,Acute myocardial infarction,Primidone,0,I don't know.
185,Acute myocardial infarction,Prochlorperazine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that establishes a causal association between Prochlorperazine and Acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the documents do mention cardiac arrest and nonspecific EKG changes as possible adverse events, and there are reports of increased mortality, particularly from cardiovascular causes, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs, which includes Prochlorperazine. The causal link between Prochlorperazine and AMI specifically would require further investigation beyond the provided context."
186,Acute myocardial infarction,lithium citrate,0,I don't know.
187,Acute myocardial infarction,Imipramine,1,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Imipramine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the documents mention that tricyclic antidepressants, which include Imipramine, should be discontinued prior to elective surgery due to possible cardiovascular effects, and hypertensive episodes have been observed during surgery in patients taking desipramine hydrochloride, a related compound. This suggests a potential for cardiovascular risks, which could theoretically include AMI, but specific evidence linking Imipramine to AMI is not provided in the provided text."
188,Acute myocardial infarction,metaxalone,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that supports a causal association between metaxalone and acute myocardial infarction. The documents focus on the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly when metaxalone is used in higher than recommended doses or in conjunction with serotonergic drugs, and other adverse reactions such as CNS depression, but do not mention acute myocardial infarction as a known adverse event."
189,Acute myocardial infarction,ramelteon,0,I don't know.
190,Acute myocardial infarction,Chlorazepate,0,I don't know.
191,Acute myocardial infarction,Temazepam,0,"Current evidence from controlled clinical studies does not establish a direct causal association between temazepam and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The provided documents list common adverse reactions to temazepam, including drowsiness, headache, and fatigue, but do not mention AMI. Cardiovascular adverse events reported at a lower frequency include dyspnea and palpitations, but not AMI."
192,Acute myocardial infarction,Methenamine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding a causal association between Methenamine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on the cardiovascular risks associated with NSAIDs, particularly ketorolac tromethamine, and do not mention Methenamine. Therefore, based on the provided documents, a causal relationship between Methenamine and AMI cannot be established."
193,Acute myocardial infarction,Urea,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that supports a causal association between urea and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on the side effects and risks associated with ACE inhibitors like quinapril and enalapril, including hypotension and renal impairment, which could theoretically contribute to cardiovascular events, but urea itself is not mentioned in relation to AMI."
194,Acute myocardial infarction,Miconazole,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context to support a causal association between Miconazole and acute myocardial infarction. The documents focus on Itraconazole, a different antifungal medication, and its contraindications, including potential cardiac effects such as congestive heart failure and ventricular dysfunction, but do not mention Miconazole or acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the provided documents, a causal relationship between Miconazole and acute myocardial infarction cannot be established."
195,Acute myocardial infarction,darifenacin,0,I don't know.
196,Acute myocardial infarction,oxybutynin,0,I don't know.
197,Acute myocardial infarction,Hyoscyamine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that establishes a causal association between hyoscyamine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on hyoscyamine's excretion in human milk, its use in different populations, overdose symptoms, and management, without mentioning AMI as an adverse reaction. However, acute and prolonged hypotensive episodes, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as adverse reactions, which could theoretically contribute to cardiac events in susceptible individuals."
198,Acute myocardial infarction,Dicyclomine,0,"Current evidence does not explicitly establish a causal association between dicyclomine and acute myocardial infarction. Adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine primarily include anticholinergic effects such as cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., palpitations, tachyarrhythmias), but acute myocardial infarction is not specifically mentioned in the provided documents. These adverse effects are generally dose-related and reversible upon discontinuation of the drug."
199,Acute myocardial infarction,Acetazolamide,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Acetazolamide and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on the cardiovascular risks associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction, particularly in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors, and in the early weeks of treatment. However, Acetazolamide is not an NSAID and is not specifically mentioned in the context of these cardiovascular risks."
200,Acute myocardial infarction,Prilocaine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided context that establishes a causal association between prilocaine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the context does mention that the intramuscular injection of prilocaine may increase creatine phosphokinase levels, which could potentially interfere with the diagnosis of AMI, as elevated levels of this enzyme are used as a biomarker for the condition. It is important to note that this does not imply prilocaine causes AMI, but rather that it may affect the diagnostic process for it."
201,Acute myocardial infarction,Flavoxate,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between Flavoxate and acute myocardial infarction. The adverse reactions listed for Flavoxate include cardiovascular effects such as tachycardia and palpitation, but acute myocardial infarction is not mentioned. Additional research and data would be required to establish any potential link."
202,Acute myocardial infarction,Sulfasalazine,0,I don't know.
203,Acute myocardial infarction,Scopolamine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided context to support a causal association between Scopolamine and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents primarily discuss adverse reactions and warnings related to Phentolamine Mesylate, with no mention of Scopolamine's direct link to AMI. However, cardiovascular effects such as tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias are noted, which could theoretically contribute to myocardial infarction risk. Further investigation into medical literature and databases would be required to establish a definitive causal relationship."
204,Acute myocardial infarction,Ketoconazole,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Ketoconazole and Acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the related antifungal drug Itraconazole has documented adverse cardiac effects, including congestive heart failure and negative inotropic effects, which could theoretically increase the risk of AMI, especially when coadministered with other drugs affecting cardiac function. It is important to note that Ketoconazole and Itraconazole are different drugs, and specific evidence for Ketoconazole's association with AMI would require separate investigation."
205,Acute myocardial infarction,Ketotifen,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that specifically links Ketotifen to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the documents discuss the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, associated with the use of NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine. Observational studies and clinical trials indicate that NSAID use, particularly at higher doses and in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors, may elevate the risk of AMI and other cardiovascular events."
206,Acute myocardial infarction,Lactulose,0,I don't know.
207,Acute myocardial infarction,Chlorothiazide,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that establishes a causal association between chlorothiazide and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on the teratogenic effects, nonteratogenic effects, and general adverse reactions of chlorothiazide, including electrolyte imbalances and potential risks in specific populations, but do not mention AMI as a known adverse event."
208,Acute myocardial infarction,Clindamycin,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between clindamycin and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The listed adverse reactions for clindamycin include various gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, skin, liver, renal, hematopoietic, immune system, and local reactions, as well as cardiopulmonary arrest and hypotension with rapid intravenous administration, but AMI is not mentioned."
209,Acute myocardial infarction,Sucralfate,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between sucralfate and acute myocardial infarction. The documents focus on drug interactions, adverse reactions, and precautions related to sucralfate, with the most common adverse effect being constipation, and no mention of acute myocardial infarction as a known adverse event."
210,Acute myocardial infarction,Tetrahydrocannabinol,0,I don't know.
211,Acute myocardial infarction,Tolmetin,1,"The evidence suggests a potential causal association between tolmetin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and acute myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses and registry studies indicate that NSAID use, including tolmetin, is associated with an increased risk of MI, heart failure, and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Additionally, tolmetin may interfere with the cardiovascular protective effects of certain medications, further contributing to the risk of adverse cardiac events."
212,Acute myocardial infarction,almotriptan,1,"There is evidence of a temporal association between almotriptan use and acute myocardial infarction, as serious cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, have been reported shortly after administration. However, due to the rarity of these events and the presence of confounding factors such as pre-existing cardiac risk factors, a definitive causal relationship has not been established. The drug's ability to cause coronary vasospasm, documented in at least one patient without prior cardiac history, suggests a possible mechanism for these adverse events, but postmarketing data's uncontrolled nature limits the ability to conclusively determine causation."
213,Acute myocardial infarction,zafirlukast,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents that establishes a causal association between zafirlukast and acute myocardial infarction. The documents focus on other adverse reactions such as hepatic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric events, and eosinophilic conditions, but do not mention acute myocardial infarction as a known adverse reaction to zafirlukast."
214,Acute myocardial infarction,nabumetone,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies suggest an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like nabumetone, particularly at higher doses and in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The risk may manifest early in treatment and persists with longer use, leading to recommendations for caution in patients with recent myocardial infarction and for monitoring signs of cardiac ischemia if nabumetone is used in such patients."
215,Acute myocardial infarction,zolmitriptan,1,"There is evidence of a causal association between zolmitriptan and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), as rare reports indicate serious cardiac adverse reactions, including AMI, occurring within a few hours of zolmitriptan administration, sometimes in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). Zolmitriptan can cause coronary artery vasospasm, which may lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction, and is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended before administering zolmitriptan to patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, and it should not be given if there is evidence of CAD or vasospasm."
216,Acute myocardial infarction,oxaprozin,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies indicate an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including acute myocardial infarction (MI), associated with the use of nonselective NSAIDs like oxaprozin, particularly at higher doses and in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The risk may arise early in treatment and increase with duration of use, and oxaprozin is contraindicated post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery and advised against in patients with a recent MI unless benefits outweigh risks."
217,Acute myocardial infarction,naratriptan,1,"Evidence suggests a causal association between naratriptan and acute myocardial infarction, as there have been rare reports of such cardiac adverse reactions occurring within a few hours of naratriptan administration, some in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). Naratriptan can induce coronary artery vasospasm, which may lead to myocardial infarction, prompting contraindications for its use in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD and the recommendation for cardiovascular evaluations before prescribing naratriptan to those with multiple cardiovascular risk factors."
218,Acute myocardial infarction,Diflunisal,1,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided context to support a causal association between Diflunisal and acute myocardial infarction. The documents primarily discuss adverse reactions associated with Fluconazole and Frovatriptan, including various cardiovascular events, but do not mention Diflunisal in relation to myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the given documents, a causal relationship cannot be established."
219,Acute myocardial infarction,benzonatate,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents linking benzonatate to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on the risk of overdose, particularly in children, and various adverse reactions such as CNS depression, convulsions, and cardiac arrest, which are primarily associated with overdose rather than routine therapeutic use. The documents also mention hypersensitivity reactions, but there is no specific mention of AMI as a known adverse event related to benzonatate."
220,Acute myocardial infarction,Ketorolac,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies suggest an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), associated with the use of nonselective NSAIDs like ketorolac, particularly at higher doses or in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The risk may begin within the first weeks of treatment and is higher for patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, where ketorolac use should be avoided unless benefits outweigh risks. Monitoring for cardiac ischemia is advised if ketorolac is used post-AMI."
221,Acute myocardial infarction,Salsalate,1,"The evidence supporting the causal association between Salsalate, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and acute myocardial infarction (MI) includes warnings of serious cardiovascular side effects such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Clinical trials and observational studies of NSAIDs have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including MI, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. Patients are advised to be vigilant for symptoms of cardiovascular events and to seek medical advice if such symptoms occur."
222,Acute myocardial infarction,salmeterol,0,"The available evidence does not establish a direct causal relationship between salmeterol and acute myocardial infarction. Postmarketing experience with salmeterol has identified cardiovascular adverse events such as arrhythmias, but due to the voluntary nature of these reports and the uncertain size of the population, it is challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal link to the drug. Clinical trials and postmarketing data have primarily highlighted an increased risk of asthma-related death when salmeterol is used as monotherapy without inhaled corticosteroids."
223,Acute myocardial infarction,bromfenac,0,"Current evidence suggests that NSAIDs, including bromfenac, may be associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), particularly at higher doses and in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors. Clinical trials and observational studies indicate that this risk may manifest early in treatment and persist over time, with recommendations to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to mitigate this risk. However, specific data on bromfenac directly causing MI is not provided in the provided context, which focuses on NSAIDs in general and ketorolac tromethamine in particular."
224,Acute myocardial infarction,Sumatriptan,1,"The evidence for a causal association between Sumatriptan and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on postmarketing reports and the known pharmacological effects of triptans, which include coronary vasospasm. While serious adverse cardiac events, including AMI, have been reported following the administration of triptans, the incidence is extremely low considering their widespread use. A definitive causal relationship has not been established due to the uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, but the possibility cannot be excluded, especially in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease."
225,Acute myocardial infarction,Piroxicam,1,"Evidence from clinical trials and observational studies suggests an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with the use of nonselective NSAIDs, including piroxicam. The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis and Danish National Registry studies indicate that NSAID use, particularly at higher doses and in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors or disease, is associated with a heightened risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including MI. Therefore, caution is advised when prescribing piroxicam, especially in patients with a history of heart failure or recent MI, and monitoring for cardiac ischemia is recommended if piroxicam is used in such individuals."
226,Acute myocardial infarction,fluticasone,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the supplied documents linking fluticasone to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The adverse reactions listed for fluticasone primarily concern local effects such as epistaxis, nasal irritation, and systemic effects like hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, with no mention of AMI. Therefore, based on the available context, a causal association between fluticasone and acute myocardial infarction cannot be established."
227,Acute myocardial infarction,Fenoprofen,1,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Fenoprofen and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the documents discuss an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in general, which may occur early in treatment and increase with the duration of use. Observational studies have also indicated an increased risk of reinfarction and cardiovascular-related death in NSAID users post-myocardial infarction."
228,Acute myocardial infarction,rizatriptan,1,"Current evidence does not establish a direct causal relationship between rizatriptan and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While rizatriptan, a 5-HT1 agonist, has been associated with various cardiovascular effects such as palpitations, tachycardia, and increased blood pressure, the provided documents do not specifically report AMI as a frequent adverse event. The role of rizatriptan in causing cardiovascular adverse events cannot be reliably determined due to limitations in adverse event reporting and the lack of quantitative frequency estimates for AMI."
229,Acute myocardial infarction,Flurbiprofen,1,"There is an established increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like flurbiprofen. This risk may occur early in treatment and increase with the duration of use, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. Observational studies have also indicated that NSAID use post-myocardial infarction can lead to a higher incidence of reinfarction and cardiovascular-related mortality."
230,Acute myocardial infarction,Indomethacin,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including acute myocardial infarction (MI), associated with the use of NSAIDs like indomethacin, particularly at higher doses and in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The risk may begin early in treatment and increases with duration of use, with indomethacin contraindicated post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery and advised against in patients with a recent MI unless benefits outweigh risks."
231,Acute myocardial infarction,Ketoprofen,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies indicate an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including acute myocardial infarction (MI), associated with the use of nonselective NSAIDs like ketoprofen, particularly at higher doses and in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The risk may manifest early in treatment and persists with prolonged use. Patients with recent MI are advised to avoid ketoprofen unless benefits outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events, and if used, they should be monitored for cardiac ischemia."
232,Acute myocardial infarction,frovatriptan,1,"There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of frovatriptan, some in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). Frovatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, which can lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction, even in patients without a history of CAD, particularly in those with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, a cardiovascular evaluation is recommended before administering frovatriptan to patients with risk factors, and its use is contraindicated in individuals with evidence of ischemic or vasospastic CAD."
233,Acute myocardial infarction,eletriptan,1,"There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of eletriptan hydrobromide, some of which occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). Eletriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, even in patients without a history of CAD, necessitating a cardiovascular evaluation in patients with multiple risk factors before administration. However, due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing surveillance, establishing a definitive causal relationship between eletriptan use and myocardial infarction is challenging."
234,Acute myocardial infarction,Etodolac,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies suggest an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with the use of nonselective NSAIDs, including etodolac, particularly at higher doses and in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The risk may manifest early in treatment and persists with prolonged use. Etodolac should be used with caution in patients with recent MI, and the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration to minimize cardiovascular thrombotic risks."
235,Acute myocardial infarction,Sulindac,1,"Clinical trials and observational studies suggest an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including Sulindac, particularly at higher doses and with longer duration of use. Sulindac is contraindicated in patients post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery due to an elevated risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events, and caution is advised in patients with a recent myocardial infarction, as NSAID use in this group has been associated with an increased risk of reinfarction and cardiovascular-related death."
236,Acute myocardial infarction,Epoetin Alfa,1,"Clinical trials, including the CHOIR study, have demonstrated an increased risk of major cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction, in patients with chronic kidney disease treated with Epoetin Alfa to achieve higher versus lower hemoglobin targets (hazard ratio 1.34). This association suggests a causal relationship between Epoetin Alfa therapy and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, particularly when used to maintain higher hemoglobin concentrations."
237,Acute myocardial infarction,darbepoetin alfa,1,"Clinical trials, including CHOIR and TREAT, have indicated an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, such as stroke, in patients treated with darbepoetin alfa, particularly among those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis, anemia, and type 2 diabetes, or with a history of cancer. However, these trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in acute myocardial infarction (MI) specifically associated with darbepoetin alfa treatment compared to control groups. The evidence suggests caution in using darbepoetin alfa due to the potential for increased cardiovascular risks, but a direct causal association with acute MI is not clearly established based on the provided documents."
238,Acute myocardial infarction,moexipril,1,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that establishes a causal association between moexipril and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the documents indicate that moexipril, like other ACE inhibitors, can cause symptomatic hypotension, particularly in patients with conditions like congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, aortic stenosis, or cerebrovascular disease, where an excessive decrease in blood pressure could potentially result in a myocardial infarction. Therefore, while a direct causal link is not established, there is a plausible mechanism by which moexipril could contribute to the risk of AMI under certain circumstances."
239,Acute myocardial infarction,Nifedipine,1,I don't know.
240,Acute myocardial infarction,Dipyridamole,1,"The evidence from a study of 3911 patients indicates that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a rare but serious adverse event associated with intravenous Dipyridamole, occurring in 0.1% of patients, with both fatal and non-fatal cases documented. This causal association is further supported by the inclusion of myocardial infarction in the warnings section of the drug's literature, although the overall incidence is low and should be weighed against the potential diagnostic benefits of the drug when used as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging."
241,Acute myocardial infarction,Amlodipine,1,"The evidence suggests that worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can occur after initiating or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, as indicated in the warnings and precautions section of the drug's labeling. This association is based on postmarketing experience and clinical trial data, although the exact frequency and causal relationship are less clear due to the voluntary nature of postmarketing reports and the complexity of patient conditions."
242,Acute myocardial infarction,Enalaprilat,1,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context that supports a causal association between Enalaprilat and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The documents focus on the effects of Enalaprilat on renal function, blood pressure, and potassium levels, with no mention of AMI as an adverse event."
243,Acute myocardial infarction,Factor VIIa,1,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding Factor VIIa and its association with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Instead, it discusses the cardiovascular risks associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The documents highlight that this risk may be present early in treatment, increase with duration of use, and is most consistently observed at higher doses. NSAIDs are contraindicated post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore, based on the provided documents, a causal association between Factor VIIa and AMI cannot be established."
244,Acute myocardial infarction,Flutamide,0,I don't know.
245,Acute myocardial infarction,Chlorambucil,0,I don't know.
246,Acute myocardial infarction,Methimazole,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents linking methimazole to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, methimazole has been associated with vasculitis, which can lead to severe complications, and since vasculitis can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular system, it is theoretically possible that vasculitis could contribute to an increased risk of AMI. Most cases of vasculitis with methimazole were associated with ANCA-positive vasculitis and improved upon drug discontinuation or with additional treatments."
247,Acute myocardial infarction,estropipate,1,I don't know.
248,Acute myocardial infarction,Acarbose,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between acarbose and acute myocardial infarction. The documents focus on gastrointestinal side effects, elevated serum transaminase levels, and other adverse reactions, but do not mention acute myocardial infarction as a known adverse event. Clinical studies have not established conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with acarbose, which includes outcomes like myocardial infarction."
249,Acute myocardial infarction,Estradiol,1,"The provided documents do not specifically address the causal association between estradiol and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, they do indicate an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in women receiving estrogen therapy, which could theoretically contribute to cardiovascular events. The documents focus on risks of VTE, endometrial and breast cancer, and other conditions associated with estrogen use, but do not provide direct evidence linking estradiol to AMI."
250,Acute myocardial infarction,"Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)",1,"The provided context does not contain specific information regarding the causal association between Estrogens, Conjugated (USP) and Acute myocardial infarction (MI). The documents focus on the cardiovascular risks associated with NSAIDs, particularly celecoxib, and other drug interactions with enalapril, but do not mention Estrogens, Conjugated (USP). Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a summary of the evidence for the association between Estrogens, Conjugated (USP) and Acute myocardial infarction."
251,Acute myocardial infarction,sitagliptin,0,"Current evidence does not establish a direct causal association between sitagliptin and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While postmarketing reports and observational studies have raised concerns about the cardiovascular safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin, clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated a significant increase in the risk of AMI with sitagliptin use compared to placebo. It is recommended to consider the risks and benefits before initiating treatment with sitagliptin in patients at risk for heart failure, a condition that can be related to AMI, and to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy."
252,Acute myocardial infarction,Tinidazole,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between Tinidazole and acute myocardial infarction. The postmarketing experience mentions adverse reactions such as severe acute hypersensitivity, seizures, neuropathy, and blood dyscrasias, but acute myocardial infarction is not listed among the identified adverse reactions.

315,GI bleed,Ketoprofen,1,"The evidence supports a causal association between ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, particularly in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or previous GI bleeding. NSAID use, including ketoprofen, is associated with a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed, especially in high-risk groups such as the elderly, those with concomitant use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and patients with poor general health status. To mitigate this risk, the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration is recommended, and physicians should monitor for signs of GI ulceration and bleeding during therapy."
316,GI bleed,Etodolac,1,"Clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance studies indicate that gastrointestinal bleeding is a probable adverse event associated with etodolac use, occurring in approximately 1 to 10% of patients. The risk of GI ulcers, bleeding, and perforation can occur at any time during treatment with NSAIDs like etodolac, with the incidence increasing with longer duration of use and in patients with a history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding."
317,GI bleed,Mefenamate,1,"The evidence indicates that the use of NSAIDs, including mefenamic acid (though not explicitly mentioned, it is a member of the NSAID class), is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding. This risk is further amplified by factors such as longer NSAID therapy duration, concurrent use of other medications like corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and certain patient characteristics including advanced age and poor general health. The provided context emphasizes the importance of using the lowest effective NSAID dosage for the shortest duration to minimize GI bleeding risks."

331,GI bleed,Itraconazole,0,"Current evidence does not explicitly list gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as an adverse event associated with itraconazole in the provided documents. However, adverse events such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and ulcerative stomatitis, which could be related to GI disturbances, have been reported. It is important to consider that adverse drug reactions can vary among individuals and may not always be predictable based on clinical trials or post-marketing reports alone."
332,GI bleed,Lamivudine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided documents to support a causal association between lamivudine and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The documents discuss adverse events such as lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, pancreatitis, and immune reconstitution syndrome, but GI bleed is not mentioned as a known adverse reaction or side effect of lamivudine in the context given."
333,GI bleed,Zidovudine,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the provided context to support a causal association between Zidovudine and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The documents focus on hematologic toxicity, such as anemia and neutropenia, and other adverse events like lactic acidosis and myopathy, but do not mention GI bleeding as a recognized adverse event. Monitoring for hematologic toxicities is advised, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function or advanced HIV-1 disease."
334,GI bleed,entecavir,0,"The provided clinical trial data and postmarketing experience do not establish a direct causal relationship between entecavir and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, but liver-related deaths including upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reported among subjects treated with entecavir. The majority of deaths in the entecavir group during the first 48 weeks of therapy were due to liver-related causes, which included upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, the frequency of GI bleed specifically as an adverse event cannot be reliably estimated from the available data."
335,GI bleed,Paromomycin,0,I don't know.
336,GI bleed,Penicillin V,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Penicillin V and GI bleed. The provided documents focus on the risks associated with NSAIDs, particularly in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, and do not mention Penicillin V. Therefore, based on the given context, a causal relationship between Penicillin V and GI bleed cannot be established."
337,GI bleed,abacavir,0,"The provided documents do not contain any direct evidence or mention of a causal association between abacavir and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The information focuses on the risk of myocardial infarction, hypersensitivity reactions, and other adverse events related to abacavir, but GI bleed is not discussed in the context of abacavir use."
338,GI bleed,terbinafine,0,"The provided context primarily discusses the risk factors and management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and does not specifically address the causal association between terbinafine and GI bleed. Therefore, based on the given documents, there is no direct evidence presented to support a causal relationship between terbinafine and GI bleeding. To determine such an association, one would need to review terbinafine-specific clinical data and post-marketing surveillance reports."
339,GI bleed,Griseofulvin,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Griseofulvin and GI bleed. The documents focus on the risks of GI bleeding associated with NSAIDs, the myelosuppressive effects of thioguanine, and other drug interactions, but do not mention Griseofulvin. Therefore, based on the provided context, a causal relationship between Griseofulvin and GI bleed cannot be established."
340,GI bleed,Stavudine,0,"The provided documents do not establish a direct causal association between stavudine and GI bleed. However, stavudine has been associated with serious adverse events such as pancreatitis, which can present with abdominal pain and could potentially lead to secondary complications including GI bleeding. Postmarketing reports and clinical trials indicate a range of adverse effects, but GI bleed is not explicitly mentioned as a known adverse event directly linked to stavudine."
341,GI bleed,Mebendazole,0,"The provided documents do not report a clear association between mebendazole and GI bleed as an adverse event. The adverse reactions listed in clinical trials and postmarketing experiences primarily include gastrointestinal disorders such as anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting, but do not specifically mention GI bleed. Therefore, based on the available data, there is no evidence to support a causal association between mebendazole and GI bleed."
342,GI bleed,Vitamin A,0,"There is no direct evidence provided in the context regarding the causal association between Vitamin A and GI bleed. The documents focus on the risks associated with NSAIDs, including factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding, such as the use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and do not mention Vitamin A. Therefore, based on the provided context, a causal relationship between Vitamin A and GI bleed cannot be established."
343,GI bleed,Potassium Chloride,1,I don't know.
