6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
  


Clinical Trials in Adult Patients with HIV-1 Infection



More than 12,000 subjects have been treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets alone or in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for periods of 28 days to 215 weeks in clinical trials and expanded access programs. A total of 1,544 subjects have received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets 300 mg once daily in clinical trials; over 11,000 subjects have received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in expanded access programs.
  

The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, Grades 2 to 4) identified from any of the 3 large controlled clinical trials include rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, asthenia, and nausea.
  

Treatment-Naïve Patients


Study 903 - Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Reactions: The most common adverse reactions seen in a double-blind comparative controlled trial in which 600 treatment-naïve subjects received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (N=299) or stavudine (N=301) in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz for 144 weeks (Study 903) were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness.
 
Mild adverse reactions (Grade 1) were common with a similar incidence in both arms and included dizziness, diarrhea, and nausea. Selected treatment-emergent moderate to severe adverse reactions are summarized in Table 4.

Study 934 – Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets + EMTRIVA 
  ® administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254). Adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with those seen in previous studies in treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects (Table 6).
  

Changes in Bone Mineral Density


In HIV-1 infected adult subjects in Study 903, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets + lamivudine + efavirenz (-2.2% ± 3.9) compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz (-1% ± 4.6) through 144 weeks. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups (-2.8% ± 3.5 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group vs. -2.4% ± 4.5 in the stavudine group). In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24 to 48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through Week 144. Twenty-eight percent of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets-treated subjects vs. 21% of the stavudine-treated subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 6 subjects in the stavudine group. In addition, there were significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C telopeptide, and urinary N telopeptide) and higher serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group relative to the stavudine group; however, except for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, these changes resulted in values that remained within the normal range 
  [See Warnings and Precautions 
   (5.6)].

Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 2 Years of Age and Older with HIV-1 Infection



Assessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomized trials (Studies 352 and 321) in 184 HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects (2 to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (N=93) or placebo/active comparator (N=91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in subjects who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were consistent with those observed in clinical trials in adults.
  

Eighty-nine pediatric subjects (2 to less than 12 years of age) received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in Study 352 for a median exposure of 104 weeks. Of these, 4 subjects discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. Three of these 4 subjects presented with hypophosphatemia and also had decreases in total body or spine BMD Z score 
  [See Warnings and Precautions 
   (5.6)].



Changes in Bone Mineral Density:


Clinical trials in HIV-1 infected children and adolescents evaluated BMD changes. In Study 321 (12 to less than 18 years), the mean rate of BMD gain at Week 48 was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets compared to the placebo treatment group. Six tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets-treated subjects and one placebo-treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body in the 28 subjects who were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for 96 weeks. In Study 352 (2 to less than 12 years), the mean rate of BMD gain in lumbar spine at Week 48 was similar between the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and the d4T or AZT treatment groups. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets compared to the d4T or AZT treatment groups. One tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated subject and none of the d4T or AZT-treated subjects experienced significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 48. Changes from baseline in BMD Z scores were -0.012 for lumbar spine and -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for 96 weeks. In both trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected 
  [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].



Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B and Compensated Liver Disease



Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions: In controlled clinical trials in 641 subjects with chronic hepatitis B (0102 and 0103), more subjects treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets during the 48-week double-blind period experienced nausea: 9% with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets versus 2% with HEPSERA. Other treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported in more than 5% of subjects treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets included: abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and skin rash.
  

During the open-label phase of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (weeks 48 to 384) in Studies 0102 and 0103, 2% of subjects (13/585) experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. No significant change in the tolerability profile was observed with continued treatment for up to 384 weeks.
  

Laboratory Abnormalities: A summary of Grades 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities through Week 48 is provided in Table 10. Grades 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities were similar in subjects continuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets treatment for up to 384 weeks in these trials.

The overall incidence of on-treatment ALT flares (defined as serum ALT greater than 2 × baseline and greater than 10 × ULN, with or without associated symptoms) was similar between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (2.6%) and HEPSERA (2%). ALT flares generally occurred within the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment and were accompanied by decreases in HBV DNA levels. No subject had evidence of decompensation. ALT flares typically resolved within 4 to 8 weeks without changes in study medication.
  

The adverse reactions observed in subjects with chronic hepatitis B and lamivudine resistance who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were consistent with those observed in other hepatitis B clinical trials in adults.
  


Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B and Decompensated Liver Disease



In a small randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (0108), subjects with CHB and decompensated liver disease received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets or other antiviral drugs for up to 48 weeks

Among the 45 subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions of any severity were abdominal pain (22%), nausea (20%), insomnia (18%), pruritus (16%), vomiting (13%), dizziness (13%), and pyrexia (11%). Two of 45 (4%) subjects died through Week 48 of the trial due to progression of liver disease. Three of 45 (7%) subjects discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Four of 45 (9%) subjects experienced a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL (1 subject also had a confirmed serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL through Week 48). Three of these subjects (each of whom had a Child-Pugh score greater than or equal to 10 and MELD score greater than or equal to 14 at entry) developed renal failure. Because both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and decompensated liver disease may have an impact on renal function, the contribution of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets to renal impairment in this population is difficult to ascertain.
  

One of 45 subjects experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare during the 48-Week trial.
  


Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Chronic Hepatitis B



Assessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomized study (Study GS-US-174-0115) in 106 pediatric subjects (12 to less than 18 years of age) infected with chronic hepatitis B receiving treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (N=52) or placebo (N=54) for 72 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in adults.
  

In this study, both the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and placebo treatment arms experienced an overall increase in mean lumbar spine BMD over 72 weeks, as expected for an adolescent population. The BMD gains from baseline to Week 72 in lumbar spine and total body BMD in tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated subjects (+5% and +3%, respectively) were less than the BMD gains observed in placebo-treated subjects (+8% and +5%, respectively). Three subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and two subjects in the placebo group had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 72. At baseline, mean BMD Z-scores in subjects randomized to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were −0.43 for lumbar spine and −0.20 for total body, and mean BMD Z-scores in subjects randomized to placebo were −0.28 for lumbar spine and −0.26 for total body. In subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for 72 weeks, the mean change in BMD Z-score was −0.05 for lumbar spine and −0.15 for total body compared to +0.07 and +0.06, respectively, in subjects receiving placebo. As observed in pediatric studies of HIV-infected patients, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected 
   [See Warnings and Precautions ( 
   
5.6)].

BOXED WARNING


WARNING: POSTTREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS
   

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted 
   [See Warnings and Precautions 
    (5.1)].  
   








WARNING: POSTTREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS
     

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.


Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. Hepatic function should be monitored closely in these patients. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 
     (5.1)
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS




• New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess estimated creatinine clearance before initiating treatment with tenofovir disoproxil   fumarate tablets. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, assess estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein before initiating treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and periodically during treatment. Avoid administering tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets with concurrentor recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. 
    (5.2)


• Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. 
    (5.3)


• Coadministration with other products: Do not use with other tenofovir-containing products (e.g., ATRIPLA, BIKTARVY, COMPLERA, DESCOVY, GENVOYA, ODEFSEY, STRIBILD, TRUVADA, or VEMLIDY). Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. 
    (5.4)


• HIV testing: HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in HIV-infected patients with or without HBV coinfection. 
    (5.5)


• Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of   BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss.  
    (5.6)


• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Observed in HIV-infected    patients. May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 
    (5.7)


• Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. 
    (5.8)








5.1 Exacerbation of Hepatitis after Discontinuation of Treatment

Discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.








5.2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets 
   [See Adverse Reactions 
   (6.2)].



It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA 
  ®, it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, and periodically during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets therapy.
  

Dosing interval adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min 
   [See Dosage and Administration 

(2.3)].
No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.
  

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) 
  [See Drug Interactions 

(7.1)].
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.
  

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients.
 








5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).








5.4 Coadministration with Other Products

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should not be used in combination with other drugs containing tenofovir DF or tenofovir alafenamide, including ATRIPLA, BIKTARVY, COMPLERA, DESCOVY, GENVOYA, ODEFSEY, STRIBILD, TRUVADA, or VEMLIDY. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should not be administered in combination with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil) 
  [See Drug Interactions 
   (7.2)].
  









5.5 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV

Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should only be used in HIV-1 and HBV coinfected patients as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen.
  

HIV-1 antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. It is also recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B before initiating treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets.
 








5.6 Bone Effects


Bone Mineral Density:


In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets 
   [See Adverse Reactions 

(6.1)].



Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis B infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected 
  [See Adverse Reactions 
   
(6.1)].




The effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adults and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained.
  

Mineralization Defects:


Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets 
  [See Adverse Reactions 

(6.2)].
Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF 
   [See Warnings and Precautions 
   
(5.2)].











5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as 
  Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, 
  Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
  

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
 








5.8 Early Virologic Failure

Clinical trials in HIV-infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virological failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS




Nursing mothers: Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed. 
    (8.3)








8.1 Pregnancy


Pregnancy Category B


There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
  

Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry: To monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263.
  

Risk Summary


Animal Data


Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 14 and 19 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tenofovir.
 








8.3 Nursing Mothers

Nursing Mothers: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. Samples of breast milk obtained from five HIV-1 infected mothers in the first post-partum week show that tenofovir is secreted in human milk. The impact of this exposure in breastfed infants is unknown. Because of both the potential for HIV-1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets.








8.4 Pediatric Use


Pediatric Patients 2 Years of Age and Older with HIV-1 infection


The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years is supported by data from two randomized trials in which tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were administered to HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced subjects. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile of tenofovir in patients 2 to less than 18 years of age at the recommended doses was similar to that found to be safe and effective in adult clinical trials 
  [See Clinical Pharmacology 
   (12.3)].
  


In Study 352, 92 treatment-experienced subjects 2 to less than 12 years of age with stable, virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen were randomized to either replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (N=44) or continue their original regimen (N=48) for 48 weeks. Five additional subjects over the age of 12 were enrolled and randomized (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets N=4, original regimen N=1) but are not included in the efficacy analysis. After 48 weeks, all eligible subjects were allowed to continue in the study receiving open-label tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. At Week 48, 89% of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group and 90% of subjects in the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group had HIV-1 RNA concentrations less than 400 copies/mL. During the 48 week randomized phase of the study, 1 subject in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group discontinued the study prematurely because of virologic failure/lack of efficacy and 3 subjects (2 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 1 subject in the stavudine or zidovudine group) discontinued for other reasons.
  

In Study 321, 87 treatment-experienced subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (N=45) or placebo (N=42) in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 374 cells/mm 
  3 and the mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log 
  10 copies/mL. At baseline, 90% of subjects harbored NRTI resistance-associated substitutions in their HIV-1 isolates. Overall, the trial failed to show a difference in virologic response between the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and placebo treatment groups. Subgroup analyses suggest the lack of difference in virologic response may be attributable to imbalances between treatment arms in baseline viral susceptibility to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and OBR.
  

Although changes in HIV-1 RNA in these highly treatment-experienced subjects were less than anticipated, the comparability of the pharmacokinetic and safety data to that observed in adults supports the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who weigh greater than or equal to 35 kg and whose HIV-1 isolate is expected to be sensitive to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets.
   [See Warnings and Precautions  
   (5.6), Adverse Reactions 
   (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology 
   (12.3)]. 
  


Safety and effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with HIV-1 infection have not been established.
  

Pediatric Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Chronic Hepatitis B


In Study 115, 106 HBeAg negative (9%) and positive (91%) subjects aged 12 to less than 18 years with chronic HBV infection were randomized to receive blinded treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets 300 mg (N=52) or placebo (N=54) for 72 weeks. At study entry, the mean HBV DNA was 8.1 log10 copies/mL and mean ALT was 101 U/L. Of 52 subjects treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, 20 subjects were nucleos(t)ide-naïve and 32 subjects were nucleos(t)ide-experienced. Thirty-one of the 32 nucleos(t)ide-experienced subjects had prior lamivudine experience. At Week 72, 88% (46/52) of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 0% (0/54) of subjects in the placebo group had HBV DNA <400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL). Among subjects with abnormal ALT at baseline, 74% (26/35) of subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets had normalized ALT at Week 72 compared to 31% (13/42) in the placebo group. One tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated subject experienced sustained HBsAg-loss and seroconversion to anti-HBs during the first 72 weeks of study participation.
  

Safety and effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age or less than 35 kg with chronic hepatitis B have not been established.
 








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.








8.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function

It is recommended that the dosing interval for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets be modified in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min or in patients with ESRD who require dialysis 
  [See Dosage and Administration 
   (2.3),Clinical Pharmacology 
   (12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGE

Limited clinical experience at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets 300 mg are available. In Study 901, 600 mg tenofovir DF was administered to 8 subjects orally for 28 days. No severe adverse reactions were reported. The effects of higher doses are not known.
  

If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary.
  

Tenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54%. Following a single 300 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, a four-hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 10% of the administered tenofovir dose.
