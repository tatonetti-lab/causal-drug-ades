6 ADVERSE REACTIONS





The most commonly reported adverse      reactions of at least moderate intensity (incidence greater than or equal      to 10%) in adult HIV-1 clinical trials were nausea, headache, malaise and      fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and dreams/sleep disorders. (
          
  
     6.1)
         
 
    
The most commonly reported adverse      reactions of at least moderate intensity (incidence greater than or equal      to 5%) in pediatric HIV-1 clinical trials were fever and/or chills, nausea      and vomiting, skin rashes, and ear/nose/throat infections. (

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions

In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir 
         
 
  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (
          
  
   5.1)]. 
         
 
  These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.
        

 
Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of Abacavir sulfate


Therapy-Naive Adults: Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 2.

Five subjects receiving abacavir sulfate in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre-existing depression compared with none in the indinavir arm. The background rates of pre-existing depression were similar in the 2 treatment arms.

Abacavir 
sulfate Once Daily versus Abacavir sulfate Twice Daily (CNA30021): Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as at least moderate) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily or abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021, were similar. For hypersensitivity reactions, subjects receiving abacavir sulfate once daily showed a rate of 9% in comparison with a rate of 7% for subjects receiving abacavir sulfate twice daily. However, subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily had this event.
        

 

Laboratory Abnormalities: Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) in therapy-naive adults during therapy with abacavir sulfate 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4.

Laboratory Abnormalities: In CNA3006, laboratory abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and CPK elevations) were observed with similar frequencies as in a trial of therapy-naive adults (CNA30024). Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir sulfate (CNA3006) as compared with adult subjects (CNA30024).
        

 

Other Adverse Events

In addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT.

Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677): The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.
        

 







6.3 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir sulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures.

Body as a Whole

Redistribution/accumulation of body fat.

Cardiovascular

Myocardial infarction.

Hepatic

Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis 
         
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
          
  
   5.2)]
         
 
  .
        

 

Skin

Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases.
There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use

(
          
  
   6.1)]

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, with multiple organ involvement, have occurred with abacavir sulfate.


Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; although, hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele

   . All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. (
          
  
     5.2)
         
 
    
  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (
          
  
     5.3)
         
 
    







5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir sulfate. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir sulfate (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment 
         
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
          
  
   6.1)]
         
 
  . Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.
        

 
Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir sulfate:

All patients should be screened for the      HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir tablets or      reinitiation of therapy with abacavir tablets, unless patients have a      previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.
Abacavir tablet is contraindicated in      patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in      HLA-B*5701-positive patients.
Before starting abacavir tablets, review      medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product.      NEVER restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing product      following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of      HLA-B*5701 status.
To reduce the risk of a life-threatening      hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue      abacavir tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected,      even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory      diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza;      gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).
If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be      ruled out, do not restart abacavir tablets or any other      abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms which may      include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.
If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled      out, patients may restart abacavir tablets. Rarely, patients who have      stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have      also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating      abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any      other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can      be readily accessed.
A Medication Guide and Warning Card that      provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should      be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.








5.2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis


 Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevation








5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir sulfate. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as 
         
 
  Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, 
         
 
  Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
        

 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.







5.4 Myocardial Infarction


 Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.

As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





Lactation: Women infected with HIV should      be instructed not to breastfeed due to potential for HIV transmission. (
          
  
     8.2)
         
 
    








8.1 Pregnancy


Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir sulfate during pregnancy. Healthcare Providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.

Risk Summary

Available data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population 
         
 
  (see Data). The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks' gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.
        

 
In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose 
         
 
  (see Data).
        

 

Data


Human Data: Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,300 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,300 exposed in second/third trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.3% to 4.3%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1% to 4.0%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens. 
        

 
Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]
         
 
  .
        

 

Animal Data: Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on Gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
        

 







8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir tablets.








8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of abacavir sulfate have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Use of abacavir sulfate is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir sulfate in adults and pediatric subjects 
         
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
          
  
   2.3), Adverse Reactions (
          
  
   6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3), Clinical Studies (
          
  
   14.2)]
         
 
  .
        

 








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of abacavir sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir sulfate in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.







8.6 Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function

A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) 
         
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
          
  
   2.4)]
         
 
  . The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir sulfate is contraindicated in these patients 
         
 
  [see Contraindications (
          
  
   4), Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]
         
 
  .
10 OVERDOSAGE






There is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir sulfate. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required. It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.
