6.1 Clinical Trials Experience


Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. 
  
  Of the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of  celecoxib capsules of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more. 
  

Pre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials
  Table 1 lists all adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥2% of patients receiving celecoxib from 12 controlled studies conducted in patients with OA or RA that included a placebo and/or a positive control group. Since these 12 trials were of different durations, and patients in the trials may not have been exposed for the same duration of time, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.

The Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study
  
   [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]


Hematological Events:The incidence of clinically significant decreases in hemoglobin (>2 g/dL) was lower in patients on  celecoxib capsules 400 mg twice daily (0.5%) compared to patients on either diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (1.3%) or ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily 1.9%. The lower incidence of events with celecoxib was maintained with or without aspirin use
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.2)]. 
   
  Withdrawals/Serious Adverse Events:
 
  Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months for withdrawals due to adverse events for celecoxib, diclofenac and ibuprofen were 24%, 29%, and 26%, respectively. Rates for serious adverse events (i.e., causing hospitalization or felt to be life-threatening or otherwise medically significant), regardless of causality, were not different across treatment groups (8%, 7%, and 8%, respectively). 
  

Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Study
  In a 12-week, double-blind, active-controlled study, 242 JRA patients 2 years to 17 years of age were treated with celecoxib or naproxen; 77 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 3 mg/kg twice daily, 82 patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg twice daily, and 83 patients were treated with naproxen 7.5 mg/kg twice daily. The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse events in celecoxib treated patients were headache, fever (pyrexia), upper abdominal pain, cough, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, nausea, arthralgia, diarrhea and vomiting. The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse experiences for naproxen-treated patients were headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, abdominal pain, and dizziness (Table 2). Compared with naproxen, celecoxib at doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg twice daily had no observable deleterious effect on growth and development during the course of the 12-week double-blind study. There was no substantial difference in the number of clinical exacerbations of uveitis or systemic features of JRA among treatment groups. 
  
  In a 12-week, open-label extension of the double-blind study described above, 202 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg twice daily. The incidence of adverse events was similar to that observed during the double-blind study; no unexpected adverse events of clinical importance emerged.

Other Pre-Approval Studies

Adverse Events from Ankylosing Spondylitis Studies:A total of 378 patients were treated with celecoxib in placebo- and active-controlled AS studies. Doses up to 400 mg once daily were studied. The types of adverse events reported in the AS studies were similar to those reported in the OA/RA studies. 
  

Adverse Events from Analgesia and Dysmenorrhea Studies:Approximately 1,700 patients were treated with celecoxib in analgesia and dysmenorrhea studies. All patients in post-oral surgery pain studies received a single dose of study medication. Doses up to 600 mg/day of celecoxib were studied in primary dysmenorrhea and post-orthopedic surgery pain studies. The types of adverse events in the analgesia and dysmenorrhea studies were similar to those reported in arthritis studies. The only additional adverse event reported was post-dental extraction alveolar osteitis (dry socket) in the post-oral surgery pain studies. 
  

The APC and PreSAP Trials

Adverse reactions from long-term, placebo-controlled polyp prevention studies:Exposure to celecoxib in the APC and PreSAP trials was 400 mg to 800 mg daily for up to 3 years
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.7)]. 
   

Some adverse reactions occurred in higher percentages of patients than in the arthritis pre-marketing trials (treatment durations up to 12 weeks;
 
  see Adverse events from celecoxib

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS



Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events
  

 



Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in the treatment and may increase with duration of use
   
    [see Warnings and Precautions (
    
     5.1)].
   
    



Celecoxib capsules are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
   
    [see Contraindications (
    
     4) and Warnings and Precautions (
    
     5.1)].
   
    






Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation






NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious (GI) events
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.2)].

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS




   


Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. (
  
     5.3)
 
    

Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. (
  
     5.4,
  
     7)
 
    

Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of celecoxib in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. (
  
     5.5)
 
    

Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. (
  
     5.6)
 
    

Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. (
  
     5.7)
 
    

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Celecoxib capsules are contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). (
  
     5.8)
 
    

Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue celecoxib capsules at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. (
  
     5.9)
 
    

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. (
  
     5.10)
 
    

Fetal Toxicity: Limit use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib capsules, between about 20 to 30 weeks in pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction. Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy due to the risks of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. (
  
     5.11,
  
     8.1)
 
    

Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. (
  
     5.12,
  
     7)
 
    









5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.  
  

  In the APC (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) trial, there was about a threefold increased risk of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke for the celecoxib capsules 400 mg twice daily and celecoxib capsules 200 mg twice daily treatment arms compared to placebo. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction [
 
  see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. 
  
  A randomized controlled trial entitled the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs. Ibuprofen Or Naproxen (PRECISION) was conducted to assess the relative cardiovascular thrombotic risk of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, compared to the non-selective NSAIDs naproxen and ibuprofen. Celecoxib 100 mg twice daily was non-inferior to naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg three times daily for the composite endpoint of the Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC), which consists of cardiovascular death (including hemorrhagic death), non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [
 
  See Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 
    To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 
  
  There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as celecoxib, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.2)].
 
  


Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery
  Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4)].
 
     
  

Post-MI Patients
  Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.   
  
  Avoid the use of celecoxib capsules in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If celecoxib is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

 








5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including celecoxib cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with celecoxib capsules. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. 
  

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation
  Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. 
  
  Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.7)].
 
  


Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:


Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue celecoxib capsules until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding
  
   [see Drug Interactions (
   
    7)].
  
   










5.3 Hepatotoxicity


Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.   
  
  Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including celecoxib.   
  
  In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib capsules, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib capsules and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib capsules and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.   
  
  Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), discontinue celecoxib capsules immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.  
 








5.4 Hypertension


NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7)].
 
     
  
  See
 
  Clinical Studies (
  
   14.6,
  
   14.7)
 
  for additional blood pressure data for celecoxib capsules. 
  
  Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

 








5.5 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.   
  
  Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of celecoxib may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs])
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7)].
 
     
  
  In the CLASS study
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.7)],
 
  the Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celecoxib capsules 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 4.5%, 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively.   
  
  Avoid the use of celecoxib capsules in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If celecoxib is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

 








5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia


Renal Toxicity
  Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.   
  
  Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.   
  
  No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. 
  
  Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib capsules
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7)].
 
  Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib capsules are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. 
  

Hyperkalemia
  Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic- hypoaldosteronism state.

 








5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions


Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4) and Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.8)].
 
     
  
  Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.

 








5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity


A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4)].
 
  When celecoxib is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

 








5.9 Serious Skin Reactions


Serious skin reactions have occurred following treatment with celecoxib capsules, including erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). These serious events may occur without warning and can be fatal.   
  
  Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of celecoxib at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.  Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4)].
 
  









5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as celecoxib capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue celecoxib capsules and evaluate the patient immediately.








5.11 Fetal Tocixity


Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus
  Avoid use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib capsules, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including celecoxib capsules, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. 
  

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment 
   
Use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib capsules, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. 
  
  If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit celecoxib capsules use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if celecoxib capsules treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue celecoxib capsules if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [
 
  see Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.1)
 
  ].

 










5.12 Hematological Toxicity


Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with celecoxib has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. 
  
  In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. 
  
  NSAIDs, including celecoxib, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7)].
 
  









5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever

The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.








5.14 Laboratory Monitoring

Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.2,
  
   5.3,
  
   5.6)].
 
  

  In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib capsules compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.

 








5.15 Disseminated intravascular Coagulation (DIC)


Because of the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation with use of celecoxib in pediatric patients with systemic onset JRA, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abnormal clotting or bleeding, and inform patients and their caregivers to report symptoms as soon as possible.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS








Infertility:NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of celecoxib capsules in women who have difficulties conceiving (
  
     8.3)
 
    


See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and Medication Guide.                       Revised: 02/2022








8.1 Pregnancy


Risk Summary
  Use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of celecoxib capsules use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation and avoid celecoxib capsules use at about 30 weeks of gestation  and later in pregnancy
 
  (see Clinical Considerations, Data).

 


Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus
  Use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib capsules, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

 








Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment
  Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.

 


Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, embryo-fetal deaths and an increase in diaphragmatic hernias were observed in rats administered celecoxib daily during the period of organogenesis at oral doses approximately  6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg twice daily. In addition, structural abnormalities (e.g., septal defects, ribs fused, sternebrae fused and sternebrae misshapen) were observed in rabbits given daily oral doses of celecoxib during the period of organogenesis at approximately 2 times the MRHD (
 
  see Data). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as celecoxib, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. 
  
  The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies, is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively.  
  

Clinical Considerations



Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions:


 
  Premature closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: 
    Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus
 
  (see Data).

 


Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:
  If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If celecoxib treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue celecoxib and follow up according to clinical practice
 
  (see Data).

 


Labor or Delivery
  There are no studies on the effects of celecoxib during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including celecoxib, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. 
  

Data


Human Data
  The available data do not establish the presence or absence of developmental toxicity related to the use of celecoxib.

 

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: 
    Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.
 

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: 
    Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. 
  
  Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.
 


Animal data
  Celecoxib at oral doses ≥150 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human exposure at 200 mg twice daily as measured by AUC
 
  0 to 24),caused an increased incidence of ventricular septal defects, a rare event, and fetal alterations, such as ribs fused, sternebrae fused and sternebrae misshapen when rabbits were treated throughout organogenesis. A dose-dependent increase in diaphragmatic hernias was observed when rats were given celecoxib at oral doses 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times human exposure based on the AUC
 
  0 to 24at 200 mg twice daily for RA) throughout organogenesis. In rats, exposure to celecoxib during early embryonic development resulted in pre-implantation and post-implantation losses at oral doses ≥50 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times human exposure based on the AUC
 
  0 to 24at 200 mg twice daily for RA).

 

Celecoxib produced no evidence of delayed labor or parturition at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg in rats (approximately 7-fold human exposure as measured by the AUC
 
  0 to 24at 200 mg twice daily). The effects of celecoxib on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.

 









8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary
  Limited data from 3 published reports that included a total of 12 breastfeeding women showed low levels of celecoxib capsules in breast milk. The calculated average daily infant dose was 10 to 40 mcg/kg/day, less than 1% of the weight-based therapeutic dose for a two-year old-child. A report of two breastfed infants 17 and 22 months of age did not show any adverse events. Caution should be exercised when celecoxib is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for celecoxib and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the celecoxib or from the underlying maternal condition.

 








8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential


Infertility


Females

  Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including celecoxib, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

 








8.4 Pediatric Use


Celecoxib is approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis in patients 2 years and older. Safety and efficacy have not been studied beyond six months in children. The long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is unknown if long-term risks may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs
 
  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.5), and Clinical Studies (
  
   14.3)]. 
   

  The use of celecoxib in patients 2 years to 17 years of age with pauciarticular, polyarticular course JRA or in patients with systemic onset JRA was studied in a 12-week, double-blind, active controlled, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study, with a 12-week open-label extension. Celecoxib has not been studied in patients under the age of 2 years, in patients with body weight less than 10 kg (22 lbs), and in patients with active systemic features. Patients with systemic onset JRA (without active systemic features) appear to be at risk for the development of abnormal coagulation laboratory tests. In some patients with systemic onset JRA, both celecoxib and naproxen were associated with mild prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but not prothrombin time (PT). When NSAIDs including celecoxib are used in patients with systemic onset JRA, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abnormal clotting or bleeding, due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patients with systemic onset JRA should be monitored for the development of abnormal coagulation tests
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.4), Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.15), Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1), Animal Toxicology (
  
   13.2), Clinical Studies (
  
   14.3)].
 
  

  Alternative therapies for treatment of JRA should be considered in pediatric patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers
 
  [see Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (
  
   8.8)].
 
  









8.5 Geriatric Use


Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.1,
  
   5.2,
  
   5.3,
  
   5.6,
  
   5.14
)].
 
  
  Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65 to74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [
 
  see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.2
,
5.6)]
 
  .

 








8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [
 
  see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology
 
  
(
  
   12.3)
 
  ].

 








8.7 Renal Impairment

Celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency
 
  [
  
   see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)and
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 
  









8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates

In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (i.e., CYP2C9*3/*3), based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) administer celecoxib starting with half the lowest recommended dose. Alternative management should be considered in JRA patients identified to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers.
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   
2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.5)].
10 OVERDOSAGE


Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.2,
  
   5.4,
  
   5.6)].
 
  

  No overdoses of celecoxib were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2,400 mg/day for up to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. No information is available regarding the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein binding (>97%) dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose. 
  
  Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. 
  
  For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).
