6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Safety data on TRACLEER were obtained from 13 clinical studies (9 placebo-controlled and 4 open-label) in 870 adult patients with PAH and other diseases. Doses up to 8 times the currently recommended clinical dose (125 mg twice daily) were administered for a variety of durations. The exposure to TRACLEER in these trials ranged from 1 day to 4.1 years (n=94 for 1 year; n=61 for 1.5 years; and n=39 for more than 2 years). Exposure of PAH patients (n=328) to TRACLEER ranged from 1 day to 1.7 years (n=174 more than 6 months and n=28 more than 12 months).
Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events other than those related to pulmonary hypertension during the clinical trials in adult patients with PAH were more frequent on TRACLEER (6%; 15/258 patients) than on placebo (3%; 5/172 patients). In this database the only cause of discontinuations >1% and occurring more often on TRACLEER was abnormal liver function.
The adverse drug events that occurred in ≥3% of the TRACLEER-treated patients and were more common on TRACLEER in placebo-controlled trials in PAH at doses of 125 or 250 mg twice daily are shown in Table 3:

Table 3: Adverse events
  
   Note: only AEs with onset from start of treatment to 1 calendar day after end of treatment are included. All reported events (at least 3%) are included except those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population.occurring in ≥3% of patients treated with TRACLEER 125-250 mg twice daily and more common on TRACLEER in placebo-controlled studies in pulmonary arterial hypertension

TRACLEER was evaluated for safety in 119 pediatric patients in uncontrolled studies. The safety profile was similar to that observed in adult patients with PAH.








Decreased Sperm Counts

An open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety study evaluated the effect on testicular function of TRACLEER 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, followed by 125 mg twice daily for 5 months. Twenty-five male patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH and normal baseline sperm count were enrolled. Twenty-three completed the study and 2 discontinued due to adverse events not related to testicular function. There was a decline in sperm count of at least 50% in 25% of the patients after 3 or 6 months of treatment with TRACLEER. Sperm count remained within the normal range in all 22 patients with data after 6 months and no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility, or hormone levels were observed. One patient developed marked oligospermia at 3 months and the sperm count remained low with 2 follow-up measurements over the subsequent 6 weeks. TRACLEER was discontinued and after 2 months the sperm count had returned to baseline levels. Based on these findings and preclinical data from endothelin receptor antagonists, it cannot be excluded that endothelin receptor antagonists such as TRACLEER have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis.










Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Treatment with TRACLEER can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment.
The overall mean decrease in hemoglobin concentration for adult TRACLEER-treated patients was 0.9 g/dL (change to end of treatment). Most of this decrease of hemoglobin concentration was detected during the first few weeks of TRACLEER treatment and hemoglobin levels stabilized by 4–12 weeks of TRACLEER treatment. In placebo-controlled studies of all uses of TRACLEER, marked decreases in hemoglobin (>15% decrease from baseline resulting in values <11 g/dL) were observed in 6% of TRACLEER-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients. In patients with PAH treated with doses of 125 and 250 mg twice daily, marked decreases in hemoglobin occurred in 3% compared to 1% in placebo-treated patients.
A decrease in hemoglobin concentration by at least 1 g/dL was observed in 57% of TRACLEER-treated patients as compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients. In 80% of those patients whose hemoglobin decreased by at least 1 g/dL, the decrease occurred during the first 6 weeks of TRACLEER treatment.
During the course of treatment, the hemoglobin concentration remained within normal limits in 68% of TRACLEER-treated patients compared to 76% of placebo patients. The explanation for the change in hemoglobin is not known, but it does not appear to be hemorrhage or hemolysis.
In a pooled analysis of pediatric patients (N=100) with PAH treated with TRACLEER, a decrease in hemoglobin levels to <10 g/dL from baseline was reported in 11% of patients. There was no decrease to <8 g/dL.










6.2 Postmarketing Experience

There have been several postmarketing reports of angioedema associated with the use of TRACLEER. The onset of the reported cases occurred within a range of 8 hours to 21 days after starting therapy. Some patients were treated with an antihistamine and their signs of angioedema resolved without discontinuing TRACLEER.
The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during the postapproval use of TRACLEER. Because these adverse reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TRACLEER exposure:

Unexplained hepatic cirrhosis
  
   [see
   
    Boxed Warning]
  
   

Liver failure
  
   [see
   
    Boxed Warning]
  
   

Hypersensitivity, DRESS, and anaphylaxis
  
   [see
   
    Contraindications (4.4)]

WARNING: RISKS OF HEPATOTOXICITY and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY


Because of the risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects, TRACLEER is available only through a restricted program called the Bosentan REMS Program. Under the Bosentan REMS, prescribers, patients, and pharmacies must enroll in the program 
   [see 
    Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] 
   . 
  






WARNING: RISKS OF HEPATOTOXICITY and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.


TRACLEER is available only through a restricted distribution program called the Bosentan REMS Program because of these risks (
     5.3): 
    


Elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) and liver failure have been reported with TRACLEER (
     5.1). 
    



Measure liver aminotransferases prior to initiation of treatment and then monthly (
      2.1, 
      5.1). 
     


Discontinue TRACLEER if aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction or injury or increases in bilirubin ≥2×ULN (
      2.4, 
      5.1). 
     



Based on animal data, TRACLEER is likely to cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy (
     4.1, 
     5.2, 
     8.1). 
    



Must exclude pregnancy before and during treatment (
      2.1, 
      4.1, 
      8.1). 
     


To prevent pregnancy, females of reproductive potential must use two reliable forms of contraception during treatment and for one month after stopping TRACLEER (
      4.1, 
      5.2, 
      8.1). 
     












Hepatotoxicity



In clinical studies, TRACLEER caused at least 3-fold upper limit of normal (ULN) elevation of liver aminotransferases (ALT and AST) in about 11% of patients, accompanied by elevated bilirubin in a small number of cases. Because these changes are a marker for potential serious hepatotoxicity, serum aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and then monthly
  
   [see
   
    Dosage and Administration (2.4),
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
  
   . In the postmarketing period, in the setting of close monitoring, rare cases of unexplained hepatic cirrhosis were reported after prolonged (>12 months) therapy with TRACLEER in patients with multiple comorbidities and drug therapies. There have also been reports of liver failure. The contribution of TRACLEER in these cases could not be excluded.
 
  


In at least one case, the initial presentation (after >20 months of treatment) included pronounced elevations in aminotransferases and bilirubin levels accompanied by non-specific symptoms, all of which resolved slowly over time after discontinuation of TRACLEER. This case reinforces the importance of strict adherence to the monthly monitoring schedule for the duration of treatment and the treatment algorithm, which includes stopping TRACLEER with a rise of aminotransferases accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction
  
   [see
   
    Dosage and Administration (2.4)]
  
   .
 
  


Elevations in aminotransferases require close attention
  
   [see
   
    Dosage and Administration (2.4)]
  
   . TRACLEER should generally be avoided in patients with elevated aminotransferases (>3×ULN) at baseline because monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be more difficult. If liver aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (such as nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in bilirubin ≥2×ULN, treatment with TRACLEER should be stopped. There is no experience with the reintroduction of TRACLEER in these circumstances.
 
  












Embryo-Fetal Toxicity



TRACLEER is likely to cause major birth defects if used by pregnant females based on animal data
  
   [see
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.2),
   
    Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]
  
   . Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment with TRACLEER. Throughout treatment and for one month after stopping TRACLEER, females of reproductive potential must use two reliable methods of contraception unless the patient has an intrauterine device (IUD) or tubal sterilization, in which case no other contraception is needed. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable contraceptives should not be used as the sole means of contraception because these may not be effective in patients receiving TRACLEER
  
   [see
   
    Drug Interactions (7.2)]
  
   . Obtain monthly pregnancy tests.
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





Fluid retention: May require intervention (
  
     5.4).
 
    
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD): If signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the diagnosis of associated PVOD and consider discontinuing TRACLEER (
  
     5.5).
 
    
Decreased sperm counts (
  
     5.6).
 
    
Decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit: Monitor hemoglobin levels after 1 and 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months thereafter (
  
     5.7).
 
    








5.1 Hepatotoxicity

ALT or AST >3
  ×ULN were observed in 11% of TRACLEER-treated patients (n=658) compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients (n=280). Three-fold increases were seen in 12% of 95 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients on 125 mg twice daily and 14% of 70 PAH patients on 250 mg twice daily. Eight-fold increases were seen in 2% of PAH patients on 125 mg twice daily and 7% of PAH patients on 250 mg twice daily. Bilirubin increases to ≥3
  ×ULN were associated with aminotransferase increases in 2 of 658 (0.3%) of patients treated with TRACLEER. In a pooled analysis of four pediatric studies conducted in PAH (n =100), elevations in liver aminotransferases ≥3×ULN were observed in 2% of patients. The combination of hepatocellular injury (increases in aminotransferases of >3
  ×ULN) and increases in total bilirubin (≥2
  ×ULN) is a marker for potential serious hepatotoxicity.
 
Elevations of AST or ALT associated with TRACLEER are dose-dependent, occur both early and late in treatment, usually progress slowly, are typically asymptomatic, and usually have been reversible after treatment interruption or cessation. Aminotransferase elevations also may reverse spontaneously while continuing treatment with TRACLEER.
Liver aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and then monthly and therapy adjusted accordingly 
  [see 
   Dosage and Administration (2.1, 
   2.4)] 
  . Discontinue TRACLEER if liver aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (such as nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in bilirubin ≥2
  ×ULN.
 
Avoid initiation of TRACLEER in patients with elevated aminotransferases (>3
  ×ULN) prior to drug initiation because monitoring hepatotoxicity in these patients may be more difficult 
  [see 
   Boxed Warning, 
   Dosage and Administration (2.6), 
   Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] 
  .
 
In WHO Functional Class II patients, consider whether the benefits of TRACLEER are sufficient to offset the risk of hepatotoxicity, which may preclude future use as their disease progresses.








5.2 Embryo-fetal Toxicity

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, TRACLEER may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test prior to TRACLEER treatment, monthly during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment. Advise females of reproductive potential to use two reliable forms of contraception during treatment with TRACLEER and for at least one month after the last dose
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2),
  
   Use in Specific Populations (8.1,
  
   8.3)]
 
  .

 
TRACLEER is only available for females through a restricted program under REMS
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
 
  .

 








5.3 Prescribing and Distribution Program for Bosentan

Because of the risks of hepatotoxicity and birth defects, TRACLEER is available only through a restricted program called the Bosentan REMS Program. As a component of the Bosentan REMS, prescribers, patients, and pharmacies must enroll in the program
 
  [see
  
   Boxed Warning,
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1,
  
   5.2),
  
   Contraindications (4.1)]
 
  .

 
Required components of the Bosentan REMS are:

Healthcare professionals who prescribe TRACLEER must review the prescriber educational materials, enroll in the Bosentan REMS Program and comply with its requirements.
Healthcare professionals must (1) review serum aminotransferases (ALT/AST) and bilirubin, and agree to order and monitor these tests monthly; and (2) for females of reproductive potential, confirm that the patient is not pregnant, and agree to order and monitor pregnancy tests monthly.
To receive TRACLEER, all patients must understand the risks and benefits, and complete a patient enrollment form.
Pharmacies that dispense TRACLEER must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the Bosentan REMS Program requirements.

Further information about TRACLEER and the Bosentan REMS Program is available at www.BosentanREMSProgram.com or 1-866-359-2612.








5.4 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema is a known clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH and is also a known effect of TRACLEER and other endothelin receptor antagonists. In PAH clinical trials with TRACLEER, combined adverse events of fluid retention or edema were reported in 1.7% (placebo-corrected) of patients.
In addition, there have been numerous postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension occurring within weeks after starting TRACLEER. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.
If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as TRACLEER or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for treatment or discontinuation of TRACLEER
 
  [see
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1),
  
   Clinical Studies (14.2)]
 
  .

 








5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease

If signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and consider whether TRACLEER should be discontinued.








5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving TRACLEER. Preclinical data also suggest that TRACLEER, similar to other endothelin receptor antagonists, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis
 
  [see
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1),
  
   Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
 
  .

 








5.7 Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Treatment with TRACLEER can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. There have been postmarketing reports of decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit that have resulted in anemia requiring transfusion. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment
 
  [see
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]
 
  .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





Nursing mothers: Choose breastfeeding or TRACLEER (
  
     8.2).
 
    








8.1 Pregnancy







Risk Summary

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, TRACLEER may cause fetal harm, including birth defects and fetal death, when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy 
  [see 
   Contraindications (4.1)] 
  . There are limited data on TRACLEER use in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of bosentan to pregnant rats at 2-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m
  2 basis caused teratogenic effects in rats, including malformations of the head, mouth, face, and large blood vessels 
  [see 
   Animal Data] 
  . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.










Data









Animal Data

Bosentan was teratogenic in rats given oral doses two times the MRHD (on a mg/m
  2 basis). In an embryo-fetal toxicity study in rats, bosentan showed dose-dependent teratogenic effects, including malformations of the head, mouth, face and large blood vessels. Bosentan increased stillbirths and pup mortality at oral doses 2 and 10 times the MRHD (on a mg/m
  2 basis). Although birth defects were not observed in rabbits given oral doses of up to the equivalent of 10.5 g/day in a 70 kg person, plasma concentrations of bosentan in rabbits were lower than those reached in the rat. The similarity of malformations induced by bosentan and those observed in endothelin-1 knockout mice and in animals treated with other endothelin receptor antagonists indicates that embryo-fetal toxicity is a class effect of these drugs.
 












8.2 Lactation







Risk Summary

Data from a case report describe the presence of bosentan in human milk. There is insufficient information about the effects of bosentan on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of bosentan on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, such as fluid retention and hepatotoxicity, in breastfed infants from TRACLEER, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TRACLEER.










8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential







Pregnancy Testing

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TRACLEER, monthly during treatment and one month after stopping treatment with TRACLEER. The patient should contact her physician immediately for pregnancy testing if onset of menses is delayed or pregnancy is suspected. If the pregnancy test is positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risks to her, the pregnancy, and the fetus.










Contraception

Drug interaction studies show that bosentan reduces serum levels of the estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives. Based on these findings, hormonal contraceptives (including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable contraceptives) may be less effective for preventing pregnancy in patients using TRACLEER and should not be used as a patient's only contraceptive method
 
  [see
  
   Drug Interactions (7.2)]
 
  . Females of reproductive potential using TRACLEER must use two acceptable methods of contraception during treatment and for 1 month after treatment with TRACLEER. Patients may choose one highly effective form of contraception (intrauterine devices (IUD) or tubal sterilization) or a combination of methods (hormone method with a barrier method or two barrier methods). If a partner's vasectomy is the chosen method of contraception, a hormone or barrier method must be used along with this method. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention, including emergency contraception, or designate counseling by another healthcare provider trained in contraceptive counseling
 
  [see
  
   Boxed Warning]
 
  .

 










Infertility









Males

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving TRACLEER. Based on these findings and findings in animals, TRACLEER may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether effects on fertility would be reversible
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.6),
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1),
  
   Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
 
  .

 












8.4 Pediatric Use

The efficacy of TRACLEER in patients <18 years is supported by data from an uncontrolled trial in which 19 pediatric patients were treated with TRACLEER. In this study, cardiopulmonary hemodynamic improvements were similar to those seen in adults treated with TRACLEER
 
  [see
  
   Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (14.1)]
 
  . Safety in pediatric patients is supported by data from 100 pediatric patients treated with TRACLEER for a median of 17 months
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Studies Experience (6.1),
  
   Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (14.1)]
 
  .

 








Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

In a juvenile rat toxicity study, rats were treated from Day 4 postpartum to adulthood (Day 69 postpartum). Decreased body weights, absolute weights of testes and epididymides, and reduced number of sperm in epididymides were observed after weaning. No effect on testis histology or sperm morphology and function was seen. The NOAEL was 4 times (at Day 4 postpartum) and 2 times (Day 69 postpartum) the human therapeutic exposure, respectively.
No effects on general development, sensory, cognitive function and reproductive performance were detected at the highest dose tested in juvenile rats, 7 times the therapeutic exposure in children with PAH.










8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of TRACLEER did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.








8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Because there is 
  in vitro and 
  in vivo evidence that the main route of excretion of bosentan is biliary, liver impairment could be expected to increase exposure (C
  max and AUC) of bosentan. The pharmacokinetics of TRACLEER have not been evaluated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the systemic exposures to bosentan and its active metabolite increased significantly. TRACLEER should generally be avoided in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment. Pharmacokinetics of bosentan were not altered in patients with mild impairment of hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class A) 
  [see 
   Dosage and Administration (2.6), 
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1), 
   Pharmacokinetics (12.3)] 
  .
 








8.7 Renal Impairment

The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bosentan is small and does not require dosing adjustment
 
  [see
  
   Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]
 
  .
10 OVERDOSAGE

Bosentan has been given as a single dose of up to 2400 mg in normal volunteers, or up to 2000 mg/day for 2 months in patients, without any major clinical consequences. The most common side effect was headache of mild to moderate intensity. In the cyclosporine A interaction study, in which doses of 500 and 1000 mg twice daily of bosentan were given concomitantly with cyclosporine A, trough plasma concentrations of bosentan increased 30-fold, resulting in severe headache, nausea, and vomiting, but no serious adverse events. Mild decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate were observed.
In the postmarketing period, there was one reported overdose of 10,000 mg of TRACLEER taken by an adolescent male patient. He had symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, dizziness, sweating, and blurred vision. He recovered within 24 hours with blood pressure support.
Bosentan is unlikely to be effectively removed by dialysis due to the high molecular weight and extensive plasma protein binding.
