The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: 

  lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]
  hepatic toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]
  neurologic symptoms and motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]
  pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]
  lipoatrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]

When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of adverse reactions may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. 







6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adults

Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients

Adverse reactions and serious laboratory abnormalities reported in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence during clinical trials were similar in type and frequency to those seen in adult patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].







6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of stavudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors.

Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever.

Digestive Disorders: anorexia.

Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and macrocytosis.

Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], hepatitis and liver failure.

Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia.

Musculoskeletal: myalgia.

Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 
5.3)].
WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS; PANCREATITIS





WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS and HEPATOMEGALY with STEATOSIS; PANCREATITIS

   See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.



Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with      steatosis, including fatal cases. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported      in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and      didanosine. 
Coadministration of stavudine with      didanosine is contraindicated. (4, 

5.1)


Fatal and nonfatal      pancreatitis have occurred when stavudine was part of a combination      regimen that included didanosine. 
Coadministration      of stavudine with didanosine is contraindicated.      (4,

5.4)











Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated because of increased risk of serious and/or life-threatening events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur.


Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.4)
].
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





  Hepatic toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with hydroxyurea. Coadministration of stavudine with didanosine is contraindicated. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (4, 5.2, 7)
  Neurologic symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3)
  Patients may develop localized loss of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5)
  Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6)







5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]
Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome.
Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis.







5.2 Hepatic Toxicity

The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated; and the combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea should be avoided. [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]

Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens


In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh >6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin).







5.3 Neurologic Symptoms

Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy.
Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose-related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy.







5.4 Pancreatitis

Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring







5.5 Lipoatrophy

In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. 
Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered.







5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





  Pregnancy: Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received both didanosine and stavudine with other agents. (4, 5.1,8.1)
  Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission. (8.2)








8.1 Pregnancy


Pregnancy Exposure Registry 

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to Stavudine for oral solution during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.

Risk Summary

Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. It is unclear if pregnancy augments the risk of lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis syndrome reported in non-pregnant individuals receiving nucleoside analogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The combination of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 
Prospective pregnancy data from APR are not sufficient to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse developmental outcomes. Available data from the APR show no increase in overall risk of major birth defects compared with 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP). The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15 to 20%. 
In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of stavudine at clinically relevant exposures. No developmental toxicities were observed in rats and rabbits at systemic exposures 112 (AUC) and 183 (Cmax) times, respectively, the exposures in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) of stavudine (see Data). 

Clinical Considerations 


Maternal Adverse Reactions 

Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome, sometimes fatal have occurred in pregnant individuals using stavudine in combination with didanosine. Stavudine is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis syndrome/hepatic steatosis syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 

Data 


Human Data 

Based on prospective reports to the APR of live births following exposure to stavudine-containing regimens during pregnancy (including 811 exposed in the first trimester and 196 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births for stavudine was 2.6% (95% CI: 1.6 % to 3.9%) with first trimester exposure and 3.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 6.5%) with second/third trimester exposure compared to the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. 
Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to stavudine is compared with a U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease. 

Animal Data 

Stavudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (0, 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 17) and rabbits (0, 60, 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18). In rats, fetal skeletal variations, including increased unossified or incomplete ossification of sternebra, were observed at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/day) (approximately 488 times human AUC exposure at the RHD). In rabbits, there were no developmental effects up to the highest dose of 600 mg/kg (approximately 183 times human Cmax exposure at the RHD). 
In the pre/post-natal development study, stavudine was administered orally to rats at 0, 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 17 to postnatal day 21. Post-implantation loss and an increase in early neonatal mortality was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 488 times human AUC exposure at the RHD). No developmental effects were observed at 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 112 times human AUC exposure at the RHD). 
Stavudine was transferred to the fetus through the placenta in rats with concentrations in fetal tissues approximately half the concentration detected in maternal plasma.








8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. 
Based on limited data, stavudine has been detected in human milk. No data are available regarding the effects of stavudine on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. 
Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) adverse reactions in breastfed infants similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving stavudine.








8.4 Pediatric Use

Use of stavudine in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of stavudine in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in pediatric patients in clinical studies were generally consistent with the safety profile of stavudine in adults. These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 pediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received stavudine 2 mg/kg/day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received stavudine 2 mg/kg/day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received stavudine 2 mg/kg/day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.
Stavudine pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in 25 HIV-1-infected pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 weeks to 15 years and in weight from 2 to 43 kg after IV or oral administration of single doses and twice-daily regimens and in 30 HIV-1-exposed or -infected newborns ranging in age from birth to 4 weeks after oral administration of twice-daily regimens [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3
, Table 9)].








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of stavudine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Greater sensitivity of some older individuals to the effects of stavudine cannot be ruled out.
In a monotherapy Expanded Access Program for patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathic symptoms were observed in 15 of 40 (38%) elderly patients receiving 40 mg twice daily and 8 of 51 (16%) elderly patients receiving 20 mg twice daily. Of the approximately 12,000 patients enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathic symptoms developed in 30% of patients receiving 40 mg twice daily and 25% of patients receiving 20 mg twice daily. Elderly patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
Stavudine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].







8.6 Renal Impairment

Data from two studies in adults indicated that the apparent oral clearance of stavudine decreased and the terminal elimination half-life increased as creatinine clearance decreased. Based on these observations, it is recommended that the stavudine dosage be modified in patients with reduced creatinine clearance and in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGE

Experience with adults treated with 12 to 24 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity. Complications of chronic overdosage include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic toxicity. Stavudine can be removed by hemodialysis; the mean ± SD hemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ± 18 mL/min. Whether stavudine is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis has not been studied.
