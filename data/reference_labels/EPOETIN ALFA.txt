6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.








Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease









Adult Patients

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including 244 patients with CKD on dialysis, were used to identify the adverse reactions to PROCRIT. In these studies, the mean age of patients was 48 years (range: 20 to 80 years). One hundred and thirty-three (55%) patients were men. The racial distribution was as follows: 177 (73%) patients were white, 48 (20%) patients were black, 4 (2%) patients were Asian, 12 (5%) patients were other, and racial information was missing for 3 (1%) patients.
Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including 210 patients with CKD not on dialysis, were used to identify the adverse reactions to PROCRIT. In these studies, the mean age of patients was 57 years (range: 24 to 79 years). One hundred and twenty-one (58%) patients were men. The racial distribution was as follows: 164 (78%) patients were white, 38 (18%) patients were black, 3 (1%) patients were Asian, 3 (1%) patients were other, and racial information was missing for 2 (1%) patients.
The adverse reactions with a reported incidence of ≥ 5% in PROCRIT-treated patients and that occurred at a ≥ 1% higher frequency than in placebo-treated patients are shown in the table below:

  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
 
  











Pediatric Patients

In pediatric patients with CKD on dialysis, the pattern of adverse reactions was similar to that found in adults.












Zidovudine-treated Patients with HIV-infection

A total of 297 zidovudine-treated patients with HIV-infection were studied in 4 placebo-controlled studies. A total of 144 (48%) patients were randomly assigned to receive PROCRIT and 153 (52%) patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo. PROCRIT was administered at doses between 100 and 200 Units/kg 3 times weekly subcutaneously for up to 12 weeks.
For the combined PROCRIT treatment groups, a total of 141 (98%) men and 3 (2%) women between the ages of 24 and 64 years were enrolled. The racial distribution of the combined PROCRIT treatment groups was as follows: 129 (90%) white, 8 (6%) black, 1 (1%) Asian, and 6 (4%) other.
In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 3 months duration involving approximately 300 zidovudine-treated patients with HIV-infection, adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 1% in patients treated with PROCRIT were:

Patients with Cancer on Chemotherapy

The data below were obtained in Study C1, a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 344 patients with anemia secondary to chemotherapy. There were 333 patients who were evaluable for safety; 168 of 174 patients (97%) randomized to PROCRIT received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 165 of 170 patients (97%) randomized to placebo received at least 1 placebo dose. For the once weekly PROCRIT-treatment group, a total of 76 men (45%) and 92 women (55%) between the ages of 20 and 88 years were treated. The racial distribution of the PROCRIT-treatment group was 158 white (94%) and 10 black (6%). PROCRIT was administered once weekly for an average of 13 weeks at a dose of 20,000 to 60,000 IU subcutaneously (mean weekly dose was 49,000 IU).

6.3 Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to epoetin alfa with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
Neutralizing antibodies to epoetin alfa that cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin and other ESAs can result in PRCA or severe anemia (with or without other cytopenias)
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.



Chronic Kidney Disease:




In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL (
   
      5.1).
  
     


No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks (
   
      2.2).
  
     


Use the lowest PROCRIT dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (
   
      5.1).
  
     




Cancer:




ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers (
   
      5.2).
  
     


Use the lowest dose to avoid RBC transfusions (
   
      2.4).
  
     


Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy (
   
      1.3).
  
     


ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure (
   
      1.5).
  
     


Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course (
   
      2.4).
  
     




Perisurgery:




Due to increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), DVT prophylaxis is recommended (
   
      5.1).

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism: Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit (
  
     5.1and
  
     14.1). Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke (
  
     5.1).
 
    
Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients With Cancer (
  
     5.2).
 
    
Hypertension: Control hypertension prior to initiating and during treatment with PROCRIT (
  
     5.3).
 
    
Seizures: PROCRIT increases the risk for seizures in patients with CKD (
  
     5.4). Increase monitoring of these patients for changes in seizure frequency or premonitory symptoms (
  
     5.4).
 
    
PRCA: If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during PROCRIT treatment, withhold PROCRIT and evaluate for PRCA (
  
     5.6).
 
    
Serious Allergic Reactions: Discontinue PROCRIT and manage reactions (
  
     5.7).
 
    
Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue PROCRIT (
  
     5.8).
 
    








5.1 Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism


In controlled clinical trials of patients with CKD comparing higher hemoglobin targets (13 – 14 g/dL) to lower targets (9 – 11.3 g/dL), PROCRIT and other ESAs increased the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, thrombosis of hemodialysis vascular access, and other thromboembolic events in the higher target groups.
Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit
  
   [see
   
    Clinical Studies (14.1)]
  
   . Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke
  
   [see
   
    Dosage and Administration (2.2)]
  
   . Patients with CKD and an insufficient hemoglobin response to ESA therapy may be at even greater risk for cardiovascular reactions and mortality than other patients. A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks.
 
  
In controlled clinical trials of patients with cancer, PROCRIT and other ESAs increased the risks for death and serious adverse cardiovascular reactions. These adverse reactions included myocardial infarction and stroke.
In controlled clinical trials, ESAs increased the risk of death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures.

The design and overall results of the 3 large trials comparing higher and lower hemoglobin targets are shown in Table 1.

Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease








Normal Hematocrit Study (NHS): A prospective, randomized, open-label study of 1265 patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis with documented evidence of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease was designed to test the hypothesis that a higher target hematocrit (Hct) would result in improved outcomes compared with a lower target Hct. In this study, patients were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeted to a maintenance hemoglobin of either 14 ± 1 g/dL or 10 ± 1 g/dL. The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings of higher mortality in the high hematocrit target group. Higher mortality (35% vs. 29%) was observed for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL than for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL. For all-cause mortality, the HR=1.27; 95% CI (1.04, 1.54); p=0.018. The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, vascular access thrombosis, and other thrombotic events was also higher in the group randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL.









CHOIR: A randomized, prospective trial, 1432 patients with anemia due to CKD who were not undergoing dialysis and who had not previously received epoetin alfa therapy were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance hemoglobin concentration of either 13.5 g/dL or 11.3 g/dL. The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings. A major cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) occurred in 125 of the 715 patients (18%) in the higher hemoglobin group compared to 97 of the 717 patients (14%) in the lower hemoglobin group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.74; p=0.03].









TREAT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of 4038 patients with: CKD not on dialysis (eGFR of 20 – 60 mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dL), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients were randomized to receive either darbepoetin alfa treatment or a matching placebo. Placebo group patients also received darbepoetin alfa when their hemoglobin levels were below 9 g/dL. The trial objectives were to demonstrate the benefit of darbepoetin alfa treatment of the anemia to a target hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL, when compared to a "placebo" group, by reducing the occurrence of either of two primary endpoints: (1) a composite cardiovascular endpoint of all-cause mortality or a specified cardiovascular event (myocardial ischemia, CHF, MI, and CVA) or (2) a composite renal endpoint of all-cause mortality or progression to end stage renal disease. The overall risks for each of the two primary endpoints (the cardiovascular composite and the renal composite) were not reduced with darbepoetin alfa treatment (see
 
  Table 1), but the risk of stroke was increased nearly two-fold in the darbepoetin alfa -treated group versus the placebo group: annualized stroke rate 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively, HR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.38, 2.68; p < 0.001. The relative risk of stroke was particularly high in patients with a prior stroke: annualized stroke rate 5.2% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group and 1.9% in the placebo group, HR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.44, 6.54. Also, among darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects with a past history of cancer, there were more deaths due to all causes and more deaths adjudicated as due to cancer, in comparison with the control group.

 












Patients with Cancer

An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions, some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 2 in Table 2
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
 
  ) of 939 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year. This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%). This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p=0.012).

 










Patients Having Surgery

An increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients receiving epoetin alfa undergoing surgical orthopedic procedures was demonstrated
 
  [see
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]
 
  . In a randomized, controlled study, 680 adult patients, not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and undergoing spinal surgery, were randomized to 4 doses of 600 Units/kg epoetin alfa (7, 14, and 21 days before surgery, and the day of surgery) and standard of care (SOC) treatment (n=340) or to SOC treatment alone (n=340). A higher incidence of DVTs, determined by either color flow duplex imaging or by clinical symptoms, was observed in the epoetin alfa group (16 [4.7%] patients) compared with the SOC group (7 [2.1%] patients). In addition to the 23 patients with DVTs included in the primary analysis, 19 [2.8%] patients (n=680) experienced 1 other thrombovascular event (TVE) each (12 [3.5%] in the epoetin alfa group and 7 [2.1%] in the SOC group). Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is strongly recommended when ESAs are used for the reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in surgical patients

Increased mortality was observed in a randomized, placebo-controlled study of PROCRIT in adult patients who were undergoing CABG surgery (7 deaths in 126 patients randomized to PROCRIT versus no deaths among 56 patients receiving placebo). Four of these deaths occurred during the period of study drug administration and all 4 deaths were associated with thrombotic events.










5.2 Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients With Cancer

ESAs resulted in decreased locoregional control/progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) (see
 
  Table 2).

 
Adverse effects on PFS and/or OS were observed in studies of patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer (Studies 1, 2, and 4), lymphoid malignancy (Study 3), and cervical cancer (Study 5); in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy (Studies 6 and 7); and in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or various malignancies who were not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Studies 8 and 9).

Decreased Overall Survival

Study 2 was described in the previous section
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 
  . Mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) was significantly higher in the epoetin alfa arm. The most common investigator-attributed cause of death within the first 4 months was disease progression; 28 of 41 deaths in the epoetin alfa arm and 13 of 16 deaths in the placebo arm were attributed to disease progression. Investigator-assessed time to tumor progression was not different between the 2 groups. Survival at 12 months was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa arm (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p=0.012).

 
Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) conducted in 344 anemic patients with lymphoid malignancy receiving chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 29 months, overall mortality rates were significantly higher among patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa as compared to placebo (HR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.82).
Study 8 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study (epoetin alfa vs. placebo) in which patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving only palliative radiotherapy or no active therapy were treated with epoetin alfa to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL. Following an interim analysis of 70 patients (planned accrual 300 patients), a significant difference in survival in favor of the patients in the placebo arm of the study was observed (median survival 63 vs. 129 days; HR 1.84; p=0.04).
Study 9 was a randomized, double-blind study (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) in 989 anemic patients with active malignant disease, neither receiving nor planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions. The median survival was shorter in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group than in the placebo group (8 months vs. 10.8 months; HR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.57).










Decreased Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival


Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 2,098 anemic women with metastatic breast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a noninferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumor progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the median progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%). At the final analysis, 1653 deaths were reported (79.8% subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77.8% subjects in the SOC group). Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18).

Study 4 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, factorial design study in which darbepoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia in 733 women receiving neo-adjuvant breast cancer treatment. A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years. The 3-year survival rate was lower (86% vs. 90%; HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.18) and the 3-year relapse-free survival rate was lower (72% vs. 78%; HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.79) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated arm compared to the control arm.
Study 5 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460 cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g/dL or to RBC transfusion support as needed. The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in thromboembolic adverse reactions in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control (19% vs. 9%). Both local recurrence (21% vs. 20%) and distant recurrence (12% vs. 7%) were more frequent in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control. Progression-free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (59% vs. 62%; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.91). Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (61% vs. 71%; HR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.68, 2.42).
Study 6 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 351 head and neck cancer patients where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins ≥ 14 and ≥ 15 g/dL for women and men, respectively. Locoregional progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.14; p=0.0008) with medians of 406 days and 745 days in the epoetin beta and placebo arms, respectively. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.84; p=0.02).










Decreased Locoregional Control

Study 7 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study conducted in 522 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy alone (no chemotherapy) who were randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin levels of 14 to 15.5 g/dL or no darbepoetin alfa. An interim analysis performed on 484 patients demonstrated that locoregional control at 5 years was significantly shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.96; p=0.02). Overall survival was shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.68; p=0.08).










5.3 Hypertension

PROCRIT is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Following initiation and titration of PROCRIT, approximately 25% of patients on dialysis required initiation of or increases in antihypertensive therapy; hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have been reported in patients with CKD receiving PROCRIT.
Appropriately control hypertension prior to initiation of and during treatment with PROCRIT. Reduce or withhold PROCRIT if blood pressure becomes difficult to control. Advise patients of the importance of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and dietary restrictions
 
  [see
  
   Patient Counseling Information (17)]
 
  .

 








5.4 Seizures

PROCRIT increases the risk of seizures in patients with CKD. During the first several months following initiation of PROCRIT, monitor patients closely for premonitory neurologic symptoms. Advise patients to contact their healthcare practitioner for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms or change in seizure frequency.








5.5 Lack or Loss of Hemoglobin Response to PROCRIT

For lack or loss of hemoglobin response to PROCRIT, initiate a search for causative factors (e.g., iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, bleeding). If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded, evaluate for PRCA
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
 
  . In the absence of PRCA, follow dosing recommendations for management of patients with an insufficient hemoglobin response to PROCRIT therapy
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.2)]
 
  .

 








5.6 Pure Red Cell Aplasia

Cases of PRCA and of severe anemia, with or without other cytopenias that arise following the development of neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported in patients treated with PROCRIT. This has been reported predominantly in patients with CKD receiving ESAs by subcutaneous administration. PRCA has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for anemia related to hepatitis C treatment (an indication for which PROCRIT is not approved).
If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during treatment with PROCRIT, withhold PROCRIT and evaluate patients for neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin. Contact Janssen Products, LP at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) to perform assays for binding and neutralizing antibodies. Permanently discontinue PROCRIT in patients who develop PRCA following treatment with PROCRIT or other erythropoietin protein drugs. Do not switch patients to other ESAs.








5.7 Serious Allergic Reactions

Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, skin rash, and urticaria may occur with PROCRIT. Immediately and permanently discontinue PROCRIT and administer appropriate therapy if a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs.








5.8 Severe Cutaneous Reactions


Blistering and skin exfoliation reactions including Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in patients treated with ESAs (including PROCRIT) in the postmarketing setting. Discontinue PROCRIT therapy immediately if a severe cutaneous reaction, such as SJS/TEN, is suspected.









5.9 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative


PROCRIT from multiple-dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated for use in neonates, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women
 
   [see
  
    Contraindications (4)]
 
   . In addition, do not mix PROCRIT with bacteriostatic saline (which also contains benzyl alcohol) when administering PROCRIT to these patient populations
 
   [see
  
    Dosage and Administration (2)].
 
   



Serious and fatal reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including PROCRIT multiple-dose vials. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. There is a potential for similar risks to fetuses and infants exposed to benzyl alcohol
 
   in uteroor in breast-fed milk, respectively. PROCRIT multiple-dose vials contain 11 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known
 
   [see
  
    Use in Specific Populations (8.1,
  
    8.2, and
  
    8.4)
].

  









5.10 Risk of Infectious Diseases Due to Albumin (Human) Content

PROCRIT contains albumin, a derivative of human blood
 
  [see
  
   Description (11)]
 
  . Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin.

 








5.11 Dialysis Management

Patients may require adjustments in their dialysis prescriptions after initiation of PROCRIT. Patients receiving PROCRIT may require increased anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





8.1 Pregnancy







Risk Summary

PROCRIT from multiple-dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated in pregnant women
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4)]
 
  . When therapy with PROCRIT is needed during pregnancy, use a benzyl alcohol-free formulation (i.e., single-dose vial). Do not mix PROCRIT with bacteriostatic saline when administering to pregnant women because it contains benzyl alcohol
 
  (see
  
   Clinical Considerations) [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.1)]
 
  .

 
The limited available data on PROCRIT use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, adverse fetal effects including embryo-fetal death, skeletal anomalies, and growth defects occurred when pregnant rats received epoetin alfa at doses approximating the clinical recommended starting doses
 
  (see
  
   Data)
 
  . Consider the benefits and risks of PROCRIT single-dose vials for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing PROCRIT to a pregnant woman.

 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.










Clinical Considerations









Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

The multiple-dose vials of PROCRIT contain benzyl alcohol. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.9),
  
   Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
 
  There is a potential for similar risks to fetuses exposed to benzyl alcohol
 
  in utero.

 












Data









Human Data

There are reports of pregnant women with anemia alone or anemia associated with severe renal disease and other hematologic disorders who received PROCRIT. Polyhydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction were reported in women with chronic renal disease, which is associated with an increased risk for these adverse pregnancy outcomes. Due to the limited number of exposed pregnancies and multiple confounding factors (such as underlying maternal conditions, other maternal medications, and gestational timing of exposure), these published case reports and studies do not reliably estimate the frequency, presence or absence of adverse outcomes.










Animal Data

When rats received PROCRIT at doses greater than or equal to 100 Units/kg/day during mating and through early pregnancy (dosing stopped prior to organogenesis), there were slight increases in the incidences of pre- and post-implantation loss, and a decrease in live fetuses in the presence of maternal toxicity (red limbs/pinna, focal splenic capsular toxicity, increased organ weights). This animal dose level of 100 Units/kg/day may approximate the clinical recommended starting dose, depending on the treatment indication. When pregnant rats and rabbits received intravenous doses of up to 500 mg/kg/day of PROCRIT only during organogenesis (gestational days 7 to 17 in rats and gestational days 6 to 18 in rabbits), no teratogenic effects were observed in the offspring. The offspring (F1 generation) of the treated rats were observed postnatally; rats from the F1 generation reached maturity and were mated; no PROCRIT-related effects were apparent for their offspring (F2 generation fetuses).
When pregnant rats received PROCRIT at doses of 500 Units/kg/day late in pregnancy (after the period of organogenesis from day 17 of gestation through day 21 of lactation), pups exhibited decreased number of caudal vertebrae, decreased body weight gain, and delayed appearance of abdominal hair, eyelid opening, and ossification in the presence of maternal toxicity (red limbs/pinna, increased organ weights). This animal dose level of 500 U/kg/day is approximately five times the clinical recommended starting dose depending on the patient's treatment indication.












8.2 Lactation







Risk Summary

PROCRIT from multiple-dose vials contains benzyl alcohol and is contraindicated in lactating women
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4),
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
 
  . Advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants
 
  [see
  
   Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
 
  There is a potential for similar risks to infants exposed to benzyl alcohol through human milk.

 
Do not mix PROCRIT with bacteriostatic saline containing benzyl alcohol, if administering PROCRIT to a lactating woman
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.1)]
 
  .

 
There is no information regarding the presence of PROCRIT in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, endogenous erythropoietin is present in human milk. Because many drugs are present in human milk, caution should be exercised when PROCRIT from single-dose vials is administered to a lactating woman.










8.4 Pediatric Use

The multiple-dose vials are formulated with benzyl alcohol and are contraindicated for use in neonates and infants
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4),
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
 
  . When therapy with PROCRIT is needed in neonates and infants, use the single-dose vial, which is a benzyl alcohol-free formulation. Do not mix the single-dose vials with bacteriostatic saline when administering PROCRIT to neonates or infants because it contains benzyl alcohol
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.6)]
 
  .

 
Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the "gasping syndrome" occurred in premature neonates and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
 
  .

 








Pediatric Patients with CKD

PROCRIT is indicated in pediatric patients, ages 1 month to 16 years of age, for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD requiring dialysis. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 month old have not been established
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Studies (14.1)]
 
  .

 
Use of PROCRIT in pediatric patients with CKD not requiring dialysis is supported by efficacy in pediatric patients requiring dialysis. The mechanism of action of PROCRIT is the same for these two populations. Published literature also has reported the use of PROCRIT in pediatric patients with CKD not requiring dialysis. Dose-dependent increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed with reductions in transfusion requirements.
The safety data from the pediatric studies and postmarketing reports are similar to those obtained from the studies of PROCRIT in adult patients with CKD
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5)and
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]
 
  . Postmarketing reports do not indicate a difference in safety profiles in pediatric patients with CKD requiring dialysis and not requiring dialysis.

 










Pediatric Patients with Cancer on Chemotherapy

PROCRIT is indicated in patients 5 to 18 years old for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age have not been established
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Studies (14.3)].
 
  The safety data from these studies are similar to those obtained from the studies of PROCRIT in adult patients with cancer
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1,
  
   5.2)and
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 
  











Pediatric Patients With HIV-infection Receiving Zidovudine

Published literature has reported the use of PROCRIT in 20 zidovudine-treated, anemic, pediatric patients with HIV-infection, ages 8 months to 17 years, treated with 50 to 400 Units/kg subcutaneously or intravenously 2 to 3 times per week. Increases in hemoglobin levels and in reticulocyte counts and decreases in or elimination of RBC transfusions were observed.










Pharmacokinetics in Neonates

Limited pharmacokinetic data from a study of 7 preterm, very low birth weight neonates and 10 healthy adults given intravenous erythropoietin suggested that distribution volume was approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher in the preterm neonates than in the healthy adults, and clearance was approximately 3 times higher in the preterm neonates than in the healthy adults.










8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 4553 patients who received PROCRIT in the 6 studies for treatment of anemia due to CKD not receiving dialysis, 2726 (60%) were age 65 years and over, while 1418 (31%) were 75 years and over. Of the 757 patients who received PROCRIT in the 3 studies of CKD patients on dialysis, 361 (47%) were age 65 years and over, while 100 (13%) were 75 years and over. No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients. Dose selection and adjustment for an elderly patient should be individualized to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2)]
 
  .

 
Among 778 patients enrolled in the 3 clinical studies of PROCRIT for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant chemotherapy, 419 received PROCRIT and 359 received placebo. Of the 419 who received PROCRIT, 247 (59%) were age 65 years and over, while 78 (19%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients. The dose requirements for PROCRIT in geriatric and younger patients within the 3 studies were similar.
Among 1731 patients enrolled in the 6 clinical studies of PROCRIT for reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions in patients undergoing elective surgery, 1085 received PROCRIT and 646 received placebo or standard of care treatment. Of the 1085 patients who received PROCRIT, 582 (54%) were age 65 years and over, while 245 (23%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between geriatric and younger patients. The dose requirements for PROCRIT in geriatric and younger patients within the 4 studies using the 3 times weekly schedule and 2 studies using the weekly schedule were similar.
Insufficient numbers of patients age 65 years or older were enrolled in clinical studies of PROCRIT for the treatment of patients treated with zidovudine for HIV-infection to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients
 
  .
10 OVERDOSAGE

PROCRIT overdosage can cause hemoglobin levels above the desired level, which should be managed with discontinuation or reduction of PROCRIT dosage and/or with phlebotomy, as clinically indicated
 
  [see
  
   Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]
 
  . Cases of severe hypertension have been observed following overdose with ESAs
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
