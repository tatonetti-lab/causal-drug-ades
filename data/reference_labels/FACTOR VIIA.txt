6.1
		     
	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
In two studies of SEVENFACT in patients with Hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, 42 subjects (27 subjects in Study 1 and 15 subjects in Study 2) have been exposed to SEVENFACT.
Study 1: The safety of SEVENFACT has been evaluated in a safety and efficacy study of 27 subjects with Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, which included treatment of 468 bleeding episodes. As described in Table 2, a total of seven adverse reactions were observed in two subjects (7.4%) treated with SEVENFACT. One episode of fever occurred in a 12-year-old subject, lasted two days, and was managed symptomatically.
Study 2: In a study with 15 subjects evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of three escalating doses of SEVENFACT (25 mcg/kg, 75 mcg/kg and 225 mcg/kg), a total of three (20%) subjects experienced four adverse reactions (Table 2).
One subject developed an infusion reaction immediately following the infusion of the first dose of 75 mcg/kg; the reaction lasted 45 minutes. Signs and symptoms included flushing, chest tightness, shakiness, transient tachycardia, and mild hypotension. Symptoms resolved without any intervention and did not recur with subsequent administration at 225 mcg/kg dose.
Adverse reactions reported in the two clinical studies are shown in Table 2.

	Immunogenicity

In Study 1, two out of 27 subjects had a positive screening assay for anti-SEVENFACT antibody at baseline, prior to exposure to SEVENFACT, and at follow-up visits. One of these two subjects had a transient SEVENFACT antibody with an additional confirmatory test for anti-SEVENFACT antibody, which was confirmed as non-neutralizing.
In Study 2, five of 15 subjects tested positive for anti-SEVENFACT antibody using a screening assay. The confirmatory assay was negative for all subjects at all time points.
No subject developed anti-rabbit milk protein antibodies during treatment with SEVENFACT.
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SEVENFACT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

	WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS






Patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors who have other risk factors for thrombosis may be at increased risk of serious arterial and venous thrombotic events (5.1).

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with SEVENFACT. Should symptoms occur, patients should discontinue SEVENFACT and seek appropriate medical intervention (5.2).








5.1
		     
	Thrombosis


There is limited information about the safety of SEVENFACT in patients with a history of arterial or venous thromboembolic disease, because such patients were excluded from SEVENFACT trials. Serious arterial and venous thrombotic reactions can occur with SEVENFACT. Such reactions have been reported in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance with a similar class of products. Neither arterial nor venous thrombotic events have been reported in SEVENFACT clinical trials.

The following patients may have increased risk of thromboembolic events with use of SEVENFACT: - History of congenital or acquired hemophilia receiving concomitant treatment with aPCC/PCC (activated or non-activated prothrombin complex) or other hemostatic agents- History of atherosclerotic disease, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, crush injury, septicemia, or thromboembolism. 

Monitor patients who receive SEVENFACT for the development of signs and symptoms of activation of the coagulation system or thrombosis. When there is laboratory confirmation of intravascular coagulation or presence of clinical thrombosis, reduce the dose of SEVENFACT or stop treatment, depending on the patient’s condition.









5.2
		     
	Hypersensitivity Reactions


No hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in SEVENFACT trials; however, hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur with SEVENFACT. Symptoms may include hives, itching, rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness of the chest, wheezing, dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. In the event of hypersensitivity reactions, patients should discontinue treatment and seek immediate medical attention.

Patients with known IgE-based hypersensitivity to casein may be at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, treatment should be discontinued. Subsequent treatment with SEVENFACT should be based on a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits.









5.3
		     
	Neutralizing Antibodies 


In the studies performed, no patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, neutralizing antibodies may occur with the use of SEVENFACT. If treatment with SEVENFACT does not result in adequate hemostasis, then suspect development of neutralizing antibody as the possible cause and perform testing as clinically indicated. 

Neutralizing antibodies to other Factor VIIa-containing products have been observed in congenital Factor VII-deficient patients. SEVENFACT has not been studied in this patient population. [See limitation of use statement under 
Indications
 and Usage

5.4
		     
	Laboratory Tests

Laboratory coagulation parameters (PT/INR, aPTT, FVII:C) do not correlate with clinical response to SEVENFACT treatment.

	USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS






8.1
		     
	Pregnancy


Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using SEVENFACT in pregnant women to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk. Animal studies evaluating the embryo-fetal teratogenic potential of SEVENFACT have not been conducted. It is unknown whether SEVENFACT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect fertility.
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.








8.2
		     
	Lactation


Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of SEVENFACT in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SEVENFACT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SEVENFACT or from the underlying maternal condition.








8.3
		     
	Females and Males of Reproductive Potential


Risk Summary

In Study 1, male patients cautioned to avoid sexual activity without condoms received SEVENFACT for the treatment of bleeding episodes. No pregnancies from sexual partners were reported. The relative benefits of SEVENFACT should be weighed against any potential risk arising from exposure in sexually active patients.
All clinical studies of SEVENFACT were performed on males, as males are predominantly affected with the congenital form of hemophilia. No adverse effects on the mating index, fertility, or conception rate were observed following administration of SEVENFACT at dose levels up to 13-fold higher than the highest recommended human dose in healthy male rats prior to and during cohabitation with healthy untreated female rats [See
 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
(

13.1

)].








8.4
		     
	Pediatric Use 

The safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT have been established for pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes. Limited clinical data for SEVENFACT in adolescents (≥12 to <18 years) were collected in an adult and adolescent study (Study 1). A total of 5 subjects were dosed with SEVENFACT. These 5 subjects were treated for a total of 79 bleeding episodes (all mild or moderate) that occurred while subjects were still under 18 years of age. Hemostatic efficacy in this subgroup (n=5) was comparable to efficacy observed in the overall population [See
 
Clinical 
Studies (

14

)].
The safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes have not been established in children < 12 years of age. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in a trial of 25 pediatric patients 6 months to < 12 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT in infants less than 6 months of age have not been evaluated.








8.5
		     
	Geriatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of SEVENFACT in patients >65 years of age have not been evaluated in clinical trials. The presence of age-related comorbidities and the attendant risks associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic events should be considered when administering SEVENFACT to patients older than 50 years of age.
10
		     
	OVERDOSAGE


There have been no reports of overdosage with SEVENFACT. Doses greater than 900 mcg/kg/day have not been studied. Doses greater than 900 mcg/kg per 24 hours may be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.
