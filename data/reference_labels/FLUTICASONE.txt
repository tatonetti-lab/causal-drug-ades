6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
In controlled US clinical trials, more than 3,300 subjects with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis received treatment with intranasal fluticasone propionate. In general, adverse reactions in clinical trials have been primarily associated with irritation of the nasal mucous membranes, and the adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by subjects treated with placebo. Less than 2% of subjects in clinical trials discontinued because of adverse reactions; this rate was similar for vehicle placebo and active comparators.
The safety data described below are based on 7 placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with allergic rhinitis. The 7 trials included 536 subjects (57 girls and 108 boys aged 4 to 11 years, 137 female and 234 male adolescents and adults) treated with fluticasone propionate 200 mcg once daily over 2 to 4 weeks and 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials which included 246 subjects (119 female and 127 male adolescents and adults) treated with fluticasone propionate 200 mcg once daily over 6 months (Table 1). Also included in Table 1 are adverse reactions from 2 trials in which 167 children (45 girls and 122 boys aged 4 to 11 years) were treated with fluticasone propionate 100 mcg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of intranasal fluticasone propionate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate or a combination of these factors.









General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions



Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, skin rash, edema of the face and tongue, pruritus, urticaria, bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, which in rare instances were severe.











Ear and Labyrinth Disorders



Alteration or loss of sense of taste and/or smell and, rarely, nasal septal perforation, nasal ulcer, sore throat, throat irritation and dryness, cough, hoarseness, and voice changes.













Eye Disorders





Dryness and irritation, conjunctivitis, blurred vision, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





Epistaxis, nasal ulceration,
  
     Candida albicansinfection, nasal septal perforation, and impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. (
  
     5.1)
 
    
Glaucoma and cataracts: Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use fluticasone long-term. (
  
     5.2)
 
    
Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, contact dermatitis, and rash) have been reported after administration of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Discontinue fluticasone propionate nasal spray if such reactions occur. (
  
     5.3)
 
    
Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. (
  
     5.4)
 
    
Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. (
  
     5.5)
 
    
Monitor growth of pediatric patients. (
  
     5.7)
 
    








5.1 Local Nasal Effects



Epistaxis


In clinical trials of 2 to 26 weeks’ duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1)]
 
  .

 


Nasal Ulceration





Postmarketing cases of nasal ulceration have been reported in patients treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)]
 
  .
 
  





Candida Infection





In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with
 
  Candida albicanshas occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of
 
  Candidainfection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.
 
  





Nasal Septal Perforation





Postmarketing cases of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)]
 
  .
 
  



Impaired Wound Healing


Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid using fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred.








5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Use of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use fluticasone long-term.








5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, contact dermatitis, and rash) have been reported after administration of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Discontinue fluticasone propionate nasal spray if such reactions occur
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4)]
 
  . Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after the administration of fluticasone propionate nasal spray.

 








5.4 Immunosuppression

Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the complete prescribing information for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
Intranasal corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.










5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression

When intranasal corticosteroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy.
The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression). Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.








5.6 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir, nefazodone, voriconazole) with fluticasone propionate nasal spray is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  .

 








5.7 Effect on Growth

Intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients
 
  [see Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.4)].
 
  Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving fluticasone propionate nasal spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate nasal spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2), Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.4)]
 
  .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS




Hepatic impairment: Monitor patients for signs of increased drug exposure. (
 
    8.6)

   








8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary
There are insufficient data on the use of fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, were observed in rats, mice, and rabbits with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate 5 times, equivalent to, and less than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m2 basis, respectively. (See Animal Data.) However, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose equivalent to the MRHDID on a mcg/m2 basis. (See Animal Data.) Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.
  Data
Human Data: Following inhaled administration, fluticasone propionate was detected in the neonatal cord blood after delivery.  
Animal Data: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID of 200 mcg/day (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). The rat no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed at approximately equivalent to the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately equivalent to the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). The mouse NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.3 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day). In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately equivalent to the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. The NOAEL was observed with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal nose only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day).  
In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at a dose 0.39 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). The NOAEL was observed in rabbit fetuses with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day). Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m2 basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day).












8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

There are no available data on the presence of fluticasone propionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Low concentrations of other corticosteroids have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fluticasone propionate nasal spray or from the underlying maternal condition.  

Data

Animal Data: Subcutaneous administration of tritiated fluticasone propionate at a dose of 10 mcg/kg/day to lactating rats resulted in measurable levels in milk.








8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of fluticasone propionate nasal spray in children aged 4 years and older have been established
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  .Six hundred fifty (650) subjects aged 4 to 11 years and 440 subjects aged 12 to 17 years were studied in US clinical trials with fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The safety and effectiveness of fluticasone propionate nasal spray in children younger than 4 years have not been established.

 


Effects on Growth


Controlled clinical trials have shown that intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. This effect was observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for "catch-up" growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks associated with alternative therapies. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate nasal spray, each patient’s dosage should be titrated to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms.
A 1-year placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 150 pediatric subjects (aged 3 to 9 years) to assess the effect of fluticasone propionate nasal spray (single daily dose of 200 mcg) on growth velocity. From the primary population receiving fluticasone propionate nasal spray (n = 56) and placebo (n = 52), the point estimate for growth velocity with fluticasone propionate nasal spray was 0.14 cm/year lower than placebo (95% CI: -0.54, 0.27 cm/year). Thus, no statistically significant effect on growth was noted compared with placebo. No evidence of clinically relevant changes in HPA axis function or bone mineral density was observed as assessed by 12-hour urinary cortisol excretion and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, respectively.
The potential for fluticasone propionate nasal spray to cause growth suppression in susceptible patients or when given at higher than recommended dosages cannot be ruled out.








8.5 Geriatric Use

A limited number of subjects aged 65 years and older (n = 129) or 75 years and older (n = 11) have been treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray in clinical trials. While the number of subjects is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety, the adverse reactions reported in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.








8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Formal pharmacokinetic trials using fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment. Since fluticasone propionate is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored.








8.7 Renal Impairment

Formal pharmacokinetic trials using fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been conducted in subjects with renal impairment.
10 OVERDOSAGE

Chronic overdosage may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.5)]
 
  . Intranasal administration of 2 mg (10 times the recommended dose) of fluticasone propionate twice daily for 7 days was administered to healthy human volunteers. Adverse events reported with fluticasone propionate were similar to placebo, and no clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory safety tests were observed. Single oral doses up to 16 mg have been studied in human volunteers with no acute toxic effects reported. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 10 mg daily for 14 days in patients were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups. Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely since 1 bottle of fluticasone propionate nasal spray contains approximately 8 mg of fluticasone propionate.
