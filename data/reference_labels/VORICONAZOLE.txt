6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 


Clinical Trials Experience in Adults



Overview

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (see Table 4) in the adult therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The adverse reactions which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 

The data described in Table 4 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in nine therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 4 includes all adverse reactions which were reported at an incidence of ≥2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. 
In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy (OLAT) in the primary treatment of patients with acute IA. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse reactions was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse reactions was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of EC. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse reactions was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

Visual Disturbances 

Voriconazole treatment-related visual disturbances are common. In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. 
The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. These effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug treatment. Fourteen days after the end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 

Dermatological Reactions 

Dermatological reactions were common in patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse reactions remains unknown. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. Erythema multiforme has also been reported during treatment with voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
Voriconazole has also been associated with additional photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)
].

Clinical Laboratory Values in Adults

The overall incidence of transaminase increases >3x upper limit of normal (not necessarily comprising an adverse reaction) was 17.7% (268/1514) in adult subjects treated with voriconazole for therapeutic use in pooled clinical trials. Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or resolved following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. 
Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. 
Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that can result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine. 
Tables 5 to 7 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with EC were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable IA were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients


The safety of voriconazole was investigated in 105 pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years, including 52 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age who were enrolled in the adult therapeutic studies.

Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

In clinical studies, serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% (48/105) of voriconazole treated pediatric patients. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 12/105 (11%) of all patients. Hepatic adverse reactions (i.e. ALT increased; liver function test abnormal; jaundice) 6% (6/105) accounted for the majority of voriconazole treatment discontinuations.

Most Common Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of pediatric patients receiving voriconazole in the pooled pediatric clinical trials are displayed by body system, in Table 8.

Hepatic-Related Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients

The frequency of hepatic-related adverse reactions in pediatric patients exposed to voriconazole in therapeutic studies was numerically higher than that of adults (28.6% compared to 24.1%, respectively). The higher frequency of hepatic adverse reactions in the pediatric population was mainly due to an increased frequency of liver enzyme elevations (21.9% in pediatric patients compared to 16.1% in adults), including transaminase elevations (ALT and AST combined) 7.6% in the pediatric patients compared to 5.1% in adults.

Clinical Laboratory Values in Pediatric Patients

The overall incidence of transaminase increases >3x upper limit of normal was 27.2% (28/103) in pediatric and 17.7% (268/1514) in adult patients treated with voriconazole in pooled clinical trials. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved on treatment with or without dose adjustment or after voriconazole discontinuation.
A higher frequency of clinically significant liver laboratory abnormalities, irrespective of baseline laboratory values (>3x ULN ALT or AST), was consistently observed in the combined therapeutic pediatric population (15.5% AST and 22.5% ALT) when compared to adults (12.9% AST and 11.6% ALT). The incidence of bilirubin elevation was comparable between adult and pediatric patients. The incidence of hepatic abnormalities in pediatric patients is shown in Table 9.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience in Adult and Pediatric Patients

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of voriconazole . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Dermatological Reactions 

Increased risk of skin toxicity with concomitant use of methotrexate, a drug associated with UV reactivation, was observed in postmarketing reports [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Adverse Reactions 
(6.1)].


Adults


Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Eye disorders: prolonged visual adverse reactions, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Skin and Appendages: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Endocrine disorders: adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome (when voriconazole has been used concomitantly with corticosteroids) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].


Pediatric Patients

There have been postmarketing reports of pancreatitis in pediatric patients.
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS






Hepatic Toxicity : Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.1)

Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation : Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.2)

Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema) : Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.4)

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions (5.5)

Photosensitivity : Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.6)

Adrenal Dysfunction:  Carefully monitor patients receiving voriconazole and corticosteroids (via all routes of administration) for adrenal dysfunction both during and after voriconazole treatment. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency (5.8)

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Inform pregnant patients of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole (5.9, 8.1, 8.3)

Skeletal Adverse Reactions : Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these adverse reactions occur (5.12)

Clinically Significant Drug Interactions : Review patient's concomitant medications (5.13, 7)

Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance, Lapp Lactase Deficiency
or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption:  Voriconazole tablets should not be given to these patients because it contains lactose (5.14)







5.1 Hepatic Toxicity

In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored in both adult and pediatric patients.
Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit/risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].








5.2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation

Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and postmarketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. 
Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as:  

Congenital or      acquired QT prolongation
Cardiomyopathy,      in particular when heart failure is present
Sinus      bradycardia
Existing      symptomatic arrhythmias
Concomitant      medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see      Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7),      and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]

Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].







5.4 Visual Disturbances

The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been postmarketing reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field, and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 







5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].







5.6 Photosensitivity

Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including pediatric patients, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (including cutaneous SCC in situ, or Bowen's disease) and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, as well as increased risk of skin toxicity with concomitant use of methotrexate, a drug associated with ultraviolet (UV) reactivation. There is the potential for this risk to be observed with other drugs associated with UV reactivation. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy.
The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.







5.7 Renal Toxicity

Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function.
Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)].







5.8 Adrenal Dysfunction

Reversible cases of azole-induced adrenal insufficiency have been reported in patients receiving azoles, including voriconazole. Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving azoles with or without concomitant corticosteroids. In patients receiving azoles without corticosteroids adrenal insufficiency is related to direct inhibition of steroidogenesis by azoles. In patients taking corticosteroids, voriconazole associated CYP3A4 inhibition of their metabolism may lead to corticosteroid excess and adrenal suppression [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cushing's syndrome with and without subsequent adrenal insufficiency has also been reported in patients receiving voriconazole concomitantly with corticosteroids.
Patients receiving voriconazole and corticosteroids (via all routes of administration) should be carefully monitored for adrenal dysfunction both during and after voriconazole treatment. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical care if they develop signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency.







5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with fetal malformations, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
If voriconazole is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking voriconazole, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].








5.10 Laboratory Tests

Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy.
Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin).







5.11 Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment.







5.12 Skeletal Adverse Reactions

Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].







5.13 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions

See Table 10 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 11 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].







5.14 Galactose Intolerance

Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS






Pediatrics : Safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 2 years has      not been established (8.4)








8.1 Pregnancy


Risk Summary 

Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of voriconazole in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral voriconazole was associated with fetal malformations in rats and fetal toxicity in rabbits. Cleft palates and hydronephrosis/hydroureter were observed in rat pups exposed to voriconazole during organogenesis at and above 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the RMD of 200 mg every 12 hours based on body surface area comparisons). In rabbits, embryomortality, reduced fetal weight and increased incidence of skeletal variations, cervical ribs and extrasternal ossification sites were observed in pups when pregnant rabbits were orally dosed at 100 mg/kg (6 times the RMD based on body surface area comparisons) during organogenesis. Rats exposed to voriconazole from implantation to weaning experienced increased gestational length and dystocia, which were associated with increased perinatal pup mortality at the 10 mg/kg dose [see Data]. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20% respectively. 

Data 


Animal Data 

Voriconazole was administered orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis (gestation days 6-17) at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day. Voriconazole was associated with increased incidences of the malformations hydroureter and hydronephrosis at 10 mg/kg/day or greater, approximately 0.3 times the recommended human dose (RMD) based on body surface area comparisons, and cleft palate at 60 mg/kg, approximately 2 times the RMD based body surface area comparisons. Reduced ossification of sacral and caudal vertebrae, skull, pubic, and hyoid bone, supernumerary ribs, anomalies of the sternebrae, and dilatation of the ureter/renal pelvis were also observed at doses of 10 mg/kg or greater. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity at any dose. 
Voriconazole was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 7-19) at 10, 40, and 100 mg/kg/day. Voriconazole was associated with increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight, in association with maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and food consumption) at 100 mg/kg/day (6 times the RMD based on body surface area comparisons). Fetal skeletal variations (increases in the incidence of cervical rib and extra sternebral ossification sites) were observed at 100 mg/kg/day. 
In a peri-and postnatal toxicity study in rats, voriconazole was administered orally to female rats from implantation through the end of lactation at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Voriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labor and produced dystocia with related increases in maternal mortality and decreases in perinatal survival of F1 pups at 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3 times the RMD.







8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary 

No data are available regarding the presence of voriconazole in human milk, the effects of voriconazole on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for voriconazole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from voriconazole or from the underlying maternal condition.







8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential


Contraception 

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole. The coadministration of voriconazole with the oral contraceptive, Ortho-Novum® (35 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg norethindrone), results in an interaction between these two drugs, but is unlikely to reduce the contraceptive effect. Monitoring for adverse reactions associated with oral contraceptives and voriconazole is recommended [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of voriconazole have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients and additional pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety data. A total of 105 pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 12 [N=26] and aged 12 to less than 18 [N=79] from two, non-comparative Phase 3 pediatric studies and eight adult therapeutic trials provided safety information for voriconazole use in the pediatric population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years has not been established. Therefore, voriconazole is not recommended for pediatric patients less than 2 years of age.
A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions. Stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted. Sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended in pediatric patients experiencing photoaging injuries, such as lentigines or ephelides, even after treatment discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Voriconazole has not been studied in pediatric patients with hepatic or renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5, 2.6)].
Hepatic function and serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.10)].








8.5 Geriatric Use

In multiple dose therapeutic trials of voriconazole, 9.2% of patients were ≥65 years of age and 1.8% of patients were ≥75 years of age. In a study in healthy subjects, the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were increased in elderly males compared to young males. Pharmacokinetic data obtained from 552 patients from 10 voriconazole therapeutic trials showed that voriconazole plasma concentrations in the elderly patients were approximately 80% to 90% higher than those in younger patients after either IV or oral administration. However, the overall safety profile of the elderly patients was similar to that of the young so no dosage adjustment is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGE

In clinical trials, there were three cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in pediatric patients who received up to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse reaction of photophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported. 
There is no known antidote to voriconazole. 
Voriconazole is hemodialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. In an overdose, hemodialysis may assist in the removal of voriconazole and SBECD from the body.
