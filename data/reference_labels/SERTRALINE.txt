6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
  
  The data described below are from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of sertraline hydrochloride (mostly 50 mg to 200 mg per day) in 3066 adults diagnosed with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD, and PMDD. These 3066 patients exposed to sertraline hydrochloride for 8 to12 weeks represent 568 patient-years of exposure. The mean age was 40 years; 57% were females and 43% were males. 
  
  The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and twice placebo) in all pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials of all sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD were nausea, diarrhea/loose stool, tremor, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, ejaculation failure, and decreased libido (see Table 3). The following are the most common adverse reactions in trials of sertraline hydrochloride (≥5% and twice placebo) by indication that were not mentioned previously.
 


MDD: somnolence;
OCD: insomnia, agitation;
PD: constipation, agitation;
PTSD: fatigue;
PMDD: somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and abdominal pain;
SAD: insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, malaise.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials 
   

  In all placebo-controlled studies in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD, 368 (12%) of the 3066 patients who received sertraline hydrochloride discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 93 (4%) of the 2293 placebo-treated patients. In placebo-controlled studies, the following were the common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients:

 


MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD: nausea (3%), diarrhea (2%), agitation (2%), and insomnia (2%).
MDD (>2% and twice placebo): decreased appetite, dizziness, fatigue, headache, somnolence, tremor, and vomiting.
OCD: somnolence.
PD: nervousness and somnolence.



Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction 
   

  Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. 
  
  Table 4 below displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients and twice placebo from pooled placebo-controlled trials. For men and all indications, the most common adverse reactions (>2% and twice placebo) included: ejaculation failure, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and male sexual dysfunction. For women, the most common adverse reaction (≥2% and twice placebo) was decreased libido.

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients 
   

  In 281 pediatric patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled studies, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. Adverse reactions that do not appear in Table 3 (most common adverse reactions in adults) yet were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients and at a rate of at least twice the placebo rate include fever, hyperkinesia, urinary incontinence, aggression, epistaxis, purpura, arthralgia, decreased weight, muscle twitching, and anxiety.

WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS


Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric and young adult patients in short-term studies. Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors
  
   [See
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
  
   .
 
  







WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS



See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.




Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients (
   
      5.1)
  
     


Closely monitor for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (
   
      5.1)
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive treatment. (
  
     5.2)
 
    
Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase this risk. (
  
     5.3)
 
    
Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder. (
  
     5.4)
 
    
Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. (
  
     5.6)
 
    
Angle Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of antidepressants, including sertraline hydrochloride, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. (
  
     5.7)
 
    
QTc Prolongation: Sertraline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation. (
  
     5.10)
 
    
Sexual Dysfunction: sertraline hydrochloride may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. (
  
     5.11)
 
    








5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2. 
  
  No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression. 
  
  Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing sertraline hydrochloride, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.
 








5.2 Serotonin Syndrome


Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including sertraline hydrochloride, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use ofother serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs
 
   [See
  
    Contraindications (4),
  
    Drug Interactions (7.1)].
 
   Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

  


Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate sertraline hydrochloride in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking sertraline hydrochloride tablets, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI
 
  [See
  
   Contraindications (4),
  
   Drug Interactions (7.1)].
 
  


Monitor all patients taking sertraline hydrochloride for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with sertraline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.








5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding


Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including sertraline hydrochloride, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with aless than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage
 
   [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

  


Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.








5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with sertraline hydrochloride or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride. Prior to initiating treatment with sertraline hydrochloride, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.








5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible
 
  [See
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
 
  









5.6 Seizures

Sertraline hydrochloride has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Sertraline hydrochloride should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.








5.7 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including sertraline hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including sertraline hydrochloride, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.








5.8 Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). 
  
  In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs
 
  [See
  
   Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]
 
  .

 








5.9 False-Positive Effects on Screening Tests for Benzodiazepines

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking sertraline hydrochloride. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will help distinguish sertraline hydrochloride from benzodiazepines
 
  [See
  
   Drug Interactions (7.3)]
 
  .

 








5.10 QTc Prolongation

During post-marketing use of sertraline, cases of QTc prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) have been reported. Most reports were confounded by other risk factors. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in    54 healthy adult subjects, there was a positive relationship between the length of the rate-adjusted QTc interval and serum sertraline concentration. Therefore, sertraline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation  
 
  [See
  
   Drug Interactions (7.1),
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].
 
  









5.11 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction
 
  [see
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]
 
  . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

 
It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of sertraline hydrochloride and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





Pregnancy: Third trimester use may increase risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and withdrawal in the neonate. (
  
     8.1)
 
    
Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in pediatric patients other than those with OCD have not been established. (
  
     8.4)
 
    








8.1 Pregnancy


Pregnancy Exposure Registry 
   

  There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers should encourage patients to enroll by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at
 
  https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants.



Risk Summary


Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage
 
  [see 
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)and Clinical Considerations]
 
  . 
  
  Overall, available published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to sertraline in the first trimester suggest no difference in major birth defect risk compared to the background rate for major birth defects in comparator populations. Some studies have reported increases for specific major birth defects; however, these study results are inconclusive
 
  [See Data]. There are clinical considerations regarding neonates exposed to SSRIs and SNRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, during the third trimester of pregnancy
 
  [See Clinical Considerations].


 

Although no teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies, delayed fetal ossification was observed when sertraline was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in rats and doses 3.1 times the MRHD in rabbits on a mg/m
 
  2basis in adolescents. When sertraline was administered to female rats during the last third of gestation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and pup deaths during the first four days after birth at the MRHD
 
  [See Data].

 

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Advise a pregnant woman of possible risks to the fetus when prescribing sertraline hydrochloride. 
  

  Clinical Considerations
  



Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

A prospective longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression who were euthymic taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressants. Consider the risks of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. 
  

  Maternal Adverse Reactions 
   

  Use of sertraline hydrochloride in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].



Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions


Exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).

When treating a pregnant woman with sertraline hydrochloride during the third trimester, carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Monitor neonates who were exposed to sertraline hydrochloride in the third trimester of pregnancy for PPHN and drug discontinuation syndrome
 
  [See Data].



Data



Human Data



Third Trimester Exposure

Neonates exposed to sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. These findings are based on post-marketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. In some cases, the clinical picture was consistent with serotonin syndrome
 
  [See
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Exposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20
 
  th
week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. A study of 831,324 infants born in Sweden in 1997 to 2005 found a PPHN risk ratio of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.3) associated with patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs “in early pregnancy” and a PPHN risk ratio of 3.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 8.3) associated with a combination of patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs “in early pregnancy” and an antenatal SSRI prescription “in later pregnancy”.

 


First Trimester Exposure


The weight of evidence from epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to sertraline in the first trimester suggest no difference in major birth defect risk compared to the background rate for major birth defects in pregnant women who were not exposed to sertraline. A meta-analysis of studies suggest no increase in the risk of total malformations (summary odds ratio=1.01, 95% CI=0.88 to 1.17) or cardiac malformations (summary odds ratio=0.93, 95% CI=0.70 to 1.23) among offspring of women with first trimester exposure to sertraline. An increased risk of congenital cardiac defects, specifically septal defects, the most common type of congenital heart defect, was observed in some published epidemiologic studies with first trimester sertraline exposure; however, most of these studies were limited by the use of comparison populations that did not allow for the control of confounders such as the underlying depression and associated conditions and behaviors, which may be factors associated with increased risk of these malformations. 
  

  Animal Data
  
 


Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 3.1 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m
 
  2basis in adolescents. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  2basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (3.1 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  2basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in stillborn pups and pup deaths during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (0.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  2basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  2basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to
 
  in uteroexposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown.

 








8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary 
   

  Available data from published literature demonstrate low levels of sertraline and its metabolites in human milk
 
  [See Data]. There are no data on the effects of sertraline on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for sertraline hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. 
  

  Data 
   

  In a published pooled analysis of 53 mother-infant pairs, exclusively human milk-fed infants had an average of 2% (range 0% to 15%) of the sertraline serum levels measured in their mothers. No adverse reactions were observed in these infants.

 








8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride have been established in the treatment of OCD in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17
 
  [See
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1),
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3),
  
   Clinical Studies (14.2)]
 
  . Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients in patients with OCD below the age of 6 have not been established. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for indications other than OCD. Two placebo-controlled trials were conducted in pediatric patients with MDD, but the data were not sufficient to support an indication for use in pediatric patients. 
  

  Monitoring Pediatric Patients Treated with Sertraline Hydrochloride 
   

  Monitor all patients being treated with antidepressants for clinical worsening, suicidal thoughts, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of treatment, or at times of dose increases or decreases
 
  [See
  
   Boxed Warning,
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 
  . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed with the use of SSRIs. Monitor weight and growth in pediatric patients treated with an SSRI such as sertraline hydrochloride. 
  

  Weight Loss in Studies in Pediatric Patients with MDD 
   

  In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50 to 200 mg) outpatient trials for MDD (n=373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo of roughly 1 kg, for both children (ages 6 to 11) and adolescents (ages 12 to 17), in both age groups representing a slight weight loss for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a slight gain for the placebo group. For children, about 7% of the sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients had a weight loss greater than 7% of body weight compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients; for adolescents, about 2% of sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of placebo-treated patients. 
  
  A subset of patients who completed the randomized controlled trials in patients with MDD (sertraline hydrochloride n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of sertraline hydrochloride treatment (10 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial + 24 weeks open-label, n=68) had weight gain that was similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. However, there are no studies that directly evaluate the long-term effects of sertraline hydrochloride on the growth, development, and maturation in pediatric patients. 
  

  Juvenile Animal Data 
   

  A study conducted in juvenile rats at clinically relevant doses showed delay in sexual maturation, but there was no effect on fertility in either males or females. 
  
  In this study in which juvenile rats were treated with oral doses of sertraline at 0, 10, 40 or 80 mg/kg/day from postnatal day 21 to 56, a delay in sexual maturation was observed in males treated with 80 mg/kg/day and females treated with doses ≥10 mg/kg/day. There was no effect on male and female reproductive endpoints or neurobehavioral development up to the highest dose tested (80 mg/kg/day), except a decrease in auditory startle response in females at 40 and 80 mg/kg/day at the end of treatment but not at the end of the drug-free period. The highest dose of 80 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels (AUC) of sertraline 5 times those seen in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) receiving the maximum recommended dose of sertraline (200 mg/day).

 








8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of sertraline hydrochloride in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD, 797 (17%) were ≥ 65 years old, while 197 (4%) were ≥ 75 years old. 
  
  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be conservative, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 
  
  In 354 geriatric subjects treated with sertraline hydrochloride in MDD placebo-controlled trials, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that shown in Table 3
 
  [See
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)],
 
  except for tinnitus, arthralgia with an incidence of at least 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in geriatric patients. 
  
  SNRIs and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction

Warnings and Precautions (5.8)

].









8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 or 6) is half the recommended dosage due to increased exposure in this patient population. The use of sertraline hydrochloride in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 10) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15) is not recommended, because sertraline hydrochloride is extensively metabolized, and the effects of sertraline hydrochloride in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied

   Dosage and Administration (2.4),
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 








8.7 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Sertraline exposure does not appear to be affected by renal impairment
 
  [See
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .
10 OVERDOSAGE

The following have been reported with sertraline tablet overdosage:

Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.
Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co-ingestants including alcohol.
Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).

Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a sertraline overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1-800-221-2222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.
