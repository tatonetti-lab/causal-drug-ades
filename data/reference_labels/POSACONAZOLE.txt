6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of posaconazole cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.


Clinical Trial Experience in Adults



Clinical Trial Experience with Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablets for Prophylaxis

The safety of posaconazole delayed-release tablets has been assessed in 230 patients in clinical trials. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of posaconazole delayed-release tablets when given as antifungal prophylaxis (Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study). Patients were immunocompromised with underlying conditions including hematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, GVHD, and post HSCT. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 51 years (range 19-78 years, 17% of patients were ≥65 years of age), and were 93% white and 16% Hispanic. Posaconazole therapy was given for a median duration of 28 days. Twenty patients received 200 mg daily dose and 210 patients received 300 mg daily dose (following twice daily dosing on Day 1 in each cohort).
 
  Table 9presents adverse reactions observed in patients treated with 300 mg daily dose at an incidence of ≥10% in Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study.

Endocrine Disorders: Pseudoaldosteronism
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS







• 
    Calcineurin Inhibitor Toxicity: Posaconazole increases concentrations of cyclosporine or tacrolimus; reduce dose of cyclosporine and tacrolimus and monitor concentrations frequently. ( 
    5.1)
   
• 
    Arrhythmias and QTc Prolongation: Posaconazole has been shown to prolong the QTc interval and cause cases of TdP. Administer with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Do not administer with drugs known to prolong QTc interval and metabolized through CYP3A4. ( 
    5.2)
   
• 
    Electrolyte Disturbances: Monitor and correct, especially those involving potassium (K 
    +), magnesium (Mg 
    ++), and calcium (Ca 
    ++), before and during posaconazole therapy. 
    (5.3)

• 
    Hepatic Toxicity: Elevations in liver tests may occur. Discontinuation should be considered in patients who develop abnormal liver tests or monitor liver tests during treatment. ( 
    5.4)
   
• 
    Concomitant Use with Midazolam: Posaconazole can prolong hypnotic/sedative effects. Monitor patients and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists should be available. ( 
    5.6, 
    7.5)
   
• 
    Vincristine Toxicity: Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions; reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options. ( 
    5.7, 
    7.10)
   
• 
    Breakthrough Fungal Infections: Monitor patients with severe diarrhea or vomiting when receiving posaconazole delayed-release tablets. ( 
    5.9)
   
• 
    Venetoclax Toxicity:Concomitant administration of posaconazole with venetoclax may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia, and serious infections; monitor for toxicity and reduce venetoclax dose. ( 
    4.6, 
    5.10, 
    7.16)








5.1 Calcineurin-Inhibitor Toxicity

Concomitant administration of posaconazole with cyclosporine or tacrolimus increases the whole blood trough concentrations of these calcineurin-inhibitors
 
  [see Drug Interactions
(
  
   7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . Nephrotoxicity and leukoencephalopathy (including deaths) have been reported in clinical efficacy studies in patients with elevated cyclosporine or tacrolimus concentrations. Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus or cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations should be performed during and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment and the tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose adjusted accordingly.

 








5.2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation

Some azoles, including posaconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. In addition, cases of torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking posaconazole.  
Results from a multiple time-matched ECG analysis in healthy volunteers did not show any increase in the mean of the QTc interval. Multiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12-hour period were recorded at baseline and steady-state from 173 healthy male and female volunteers (18 -85 years of age) administered Noxafil
 
  ®oral suspension 400 mg twice daily with a high-fat meal. In this pooled analysis, the mean QTc (Fridericia) interval change from baseline was –5 msec following administration of the recommended clinical dose. A decrease in the QTc(F) interval (–3 msec) was also observed in a small number of subjects (n=16) administered placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum QTc(F) interval change from baseline was <0 msec (–8 msec). No healthy subject administered posaconazole had a QTc(F) interval ≥500 msec or an increase ≥60 msec in their QTc(F) interval from baseline.  

 
Posaconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Do not administer with drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval and are metabolized through CYP3A4
 
  [see Contraindications (

4.3

) and Drug Interactions (

7.2

)].

 








5.3 Electrolyte Disturbances

Electrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy.








5.4 Hepatic Toxicity

Hepatic reactions (e.g., mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported in clinical trials. The elevations in liver tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy, and in some instances these tests normalized without drug interruption. Cases of more severe hepatic reactions including cholestasis or hepatic failure including deaths have been reported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic malignancy) during treatment with posaconazole. These severe hepatic reactions were seen primarily in subjects receiving the Noxafil
 
  ®oral suspension 800 mg daily (400 mg twice daily or 200 mg four times a day) in clinical trials.  

 
Liver tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver tests during posaconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of posaconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to posaconazole.








5.5 Renal Impairment

Due to the variability in exposure with posaconazole delayed-release tablets, Noxafil
 
  ® oral suspension, and Noxafil
 
  ®PowderMix for delayed-release oral suspension, patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections
 
  [see Dosage and Administration
(
  
   2.9) and Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.6)]. 
 
  









5.6 Midazolam Toxicity

Concomitant administration of posaconazole with midazolam increases the midazolam plasma concentrations by approximately 5-fold. Increased plasma midazolam concentrations could potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects. Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects associated with high plasma concentrations of midazolam and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists must be available to reverse these effects
 
  [see Drug Interact
ions (
  
   7.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].
 
  









5.7 Vincristine Toxicity

Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options
 
  [see Drug Interactions (

7.10

)].









5.9 Breakthrough Fungal Infections

Patients who have severe diarrhea or vomiting should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections when receiving posaconazole delayed-release tablets.








5.10 Venetoclax Toxicity

Concomitant administration of posaconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with venetoclax may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), neutropenia, and serious infections. In patients with CLL/SLL, administration of posaconazole during initiation and the ramp-up phase of venetoclax is contraindicated
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4.6)]. 
 
  Refer to the venetoclax labeling for safety monitoring and dose reduction in the steady daily dosing phase in CLL/SLL patients.

 
For patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), dose reduction and safety monitoring are recommended across all dosing phases when coadministering posaconazole with venetoclax
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7.16)]
 
  . Refer to the venetoclax prescribing information for dosing instructions.5.1 Calcineurin-Inhibitor Toxicity

Concomitant administration of posaconazole with cyclosporine or tacrolimus increases the whole blood trough concentrations of these calcineurin-inhibitors
 
  [see Drug Interactions
(
  
   7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . Nephrotoxicity and leukoencephalopathy (including deaths) have been reported in clinical efficacy studies in patients with elevated cyclosporine or tacrolimus concentrations. Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus or cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations should be performed during and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment and the tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose adjusted accordingly.5.2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation

8.1 Pregnancy


Risk Summary

Based on findings from animal data, posaconazole may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Available data for use of posaconazole in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, skeletal malformations (cranial malformations and missing ribs) and maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and reduced body weight gain) were observed when posaconazole was dosed orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses ≥1.4 times the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen based on steady-state plasma concentrations of posaconazole in healthy volunteers. In pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis, increased resorptions, reduced litter size, and reduced body weight gain of females were seen at doses 5 times the exposure achieved with the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen. Doses of ≥3 times the clinical exposure caused an increase in resorptions in these rabbits (see Data). Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data


Animal Data

Posaconazole resulted in maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and reduced body weight gain) and skeletal malformations (cranial malformations and missing ribs) when given orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestational Days 6 through 15) at doses ≥27 mg/kg (≥1.4 times the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen based on steady-state plasma concentrations of drug in healthy volunteers). The no effect dose for malformations and maternal toxicity in rats was 9 mg/kg, which is 0.7 times the exposure achieved with the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen. No malformations were seen in rabbits dosed during organogenesis (Gestational Days 7 through 19) at doses up to 80 mg/kg (5 times the exposure achieved with the 400 mg twice daily oral suspension regimen). In the rabbit, the no-effect dose was 20 mg/kg, while high doses of 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg (3 or 5 times the clinical exposure) caused an increase in resorptions. In rabbits dosed at 80 mg/kg, a reduction in body weight gain of females and a reduction in litter size were seen.








8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of posaconazole in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Posaconazole is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for posaconazole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from posaconazole or from the underlying maternal condition.








8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of posaconazole delayed-release tablets for the prophylaxis of invasive
 
  Aspergillusand
 
  Candidainfections have been established in pediatric patients aged 13 years and older who are at high risk of developing these infections due to being severely immunocompromised, such as HSCT recipients with GVHD or those with hematologic malignancies with prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy.

 
Use of posaconazole in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of posaconazole in adult and pediatric patients and additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (

6.1

), Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

) and Clinical Studies (

14

)].

The safety and effectiveness of posaconazole have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.

Additional Pediatric Use information is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.’s Noxafil
  
   ®(posaconazole delayed-release tablets). However, due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 
 
  









8.5 Geriatric Use

No overall differences in the safety of posaconazole delayed-release tablets were observed between geriatric patients and younger adult patients in the clinical trials; therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for any formulation of posaconazole in geriatric patients. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients during clinical trials
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].

Of the 230 patients treated with posaconazole delayed-release tablets, 38 (17%) were greater than 65 years of age. 
No overall differences in the pharmacokinetics and safety were observed between elderly and young subjects during clinical trials, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.








8.6 Renal Impairment

Following single-dose administration of 400 mg of the Noxafil
 
  ®oral suspension, there was no significant effect of mild (eGFR: 50-80 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  2, n=6) or moderate (eGFR: 20-49 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  2, n=6) renal impairment on posaconazole pharmacokinetics; therefore, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR: <20 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  2), the mean plasma exposure (AUC) was similar to that in patients with normal renal function (eGFR: >80 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  2); however, the range of the AUC estimates was highly variable (CV=96%) in these subjects with severe renal impairment as compared to that in the other renal impairment groups (CV<40%). Due to the variability in exposure, patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (

2

)]. Similar recommendations apply to posaconazole delayed-release tablets; however, a specific study has not been conducted with the posaconazole delayed-release tablets.

 








8.7 Hepatic Impairment

After a single oral dose of Noxafil
 
  ®oral suspension 400 mg, the mean AUC was 43%, 27%, and 21% higher in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A, N=6), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B, N=6), or severe (Child-Pugh Class C, N=6) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (N=18). Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, the mean C
 
  maxwas 1% higher, 40% higher, and 34% lower in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, respectively. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was reduced by 18%, 36%, and 28% in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The elimination half-life (t
 
  ½) was 27 hours, 39 hours, 27 hours, and 43 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, respectively.  

 
It is recommended that no dose adjustment of posaconazole delayed-release tablets is needed in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C)
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (

2

) and Warnings and Precautions (

5.4

)]. However, a specific study has not been conducted with posaconazole delayed-release tablets.

 








8.8 Gender

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are comparable in males and females. No adjustment in the dosage of posaconazole is necessary based on gender.








8.9 Race

The pharmacokinetic profile of posaconazole is not significantly affected by race. No adjustment in the dosage of posaconazole is necessary based on race.








8.10 Weight

Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that patients weighing greater than 120 kg may have lower posaconazole plasma drug exposure. It is, therefore, suggested to closely monitor for breakthrough fungal infections.8.8 Gender

The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole are comparable in males and females. No adjustment in the dosage of posaconazole is necessary based on gender.8.9 Race

The pharmacokinetic profile of posaconazole is not significantly affected by race. No adjustment in the dosage of posaconazole is necessary based on race.8.10 Weight

Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that patients weighing greater than 120 kg may have lower posaconazole plasma drug exposure. It is, therefore, suggested to closely monitor for breakthrough fungal infections.
10 OVERDOSAGE

There is no experience with overdosage of posaconazole delayed-release tablets.
During the clinical trials, some patients received Noxafil
 
  ®oral suspension up to 1600 mg/day with no adverse reactions noted that were different from the lower doses. In addition, accidental overdose was noted in one patient who took 1200 mg twice daily Noxafil
 
  ®oral suspension for 3 days. No related adverse reactions were noted by the investigator.

 
Posaconazole is not removed by hemodialysis.
