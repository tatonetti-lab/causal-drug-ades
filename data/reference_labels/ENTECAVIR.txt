6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults


Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 

Compensated Liver Disease 

Assessment of adverse reactions is based on four studies (AI463014, AI463022, AI463026 and AI463027) in which 1720 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day (n=679), entecavir 1 mg/day (n=183), or lamivudine (n=858) for up to 2 years. Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463026 and AI463014. The safety profiles of entecavir and lamivudine were comparable in these studies. 
The most common adverse reactions of any severity (≥3%) with at least a possible relation to study drug for entecavir-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. The most common adverse reactions among lamivudine-treated subjects were headache, fatigue and dizziness. One percent of entecavir-treated subjects in these four studies compared with 4% of lamivudine-treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results. 
Clinical adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in four clinical studies in which entecavir was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 3.

 ULN=upper limit of normal. 



Among entecavir-treated subjects in these studies, on-treatment ALT elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and greater than 2 times baseline generally resolved with continued treatment. A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a ≥2 log
         
 
  10/mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment. 
        

 


Exacerbations of Hepatitis after Discontinuation of Treatment 


An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the subject’s reference level (minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing). For all subjects who discontinued treatment (regardless of reason), Table 5 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post-treatment ALT flares. In these studies, a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol-defined response to therapy. If entecavir is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment flares could be higher

Decompensated Liver Disease 

Study AI463048 was a randomized, open-label study of entecavir 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily given for up to 48 weeks in adult subjects with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or higher 
         
 
  [see 
          
  
   Clinical Studies (14.1)]
         
 
  . Among the 102 subjects receiving entecavir, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any severity, regardless of causality, occurring through Week 48 were peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia (14%), hepatic encephalopathy (10%) and upper respiratory infection (10%). Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 2 that were observed through Week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased (2%) and renal failure (<1%). 
        

 
Eighteen of 102 (18%) subjects treated with entecavir and 18/89 (20%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy. The majority of deaths (11 in the entecavir group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group) were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through Week 48 was 6% (6/102) for subjects treated with entecavir and 8% (7/89) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Five percent of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through Week 48.
No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 x baseline and >10 x ULN) through Week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with entecavir and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through Week 48. 

HIV/HBV Co-infected 

The safety profile of entecavir 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected subjects

Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Lactic acidosis. 
        

 

Hepatobiliary disorders: Increased transaminases. 
        

 

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, rash.
WARNING: SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B, PATIENTS CO-INFECTED WITH HIV AND HBV, AND LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND HEPATOMEGALY



Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted 
        
  
   [see 
         
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
        
  
   . 
       
 
  


Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir
is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated. Therapy with entecavir
is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)

WARNING: SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B, PATIENTS CO-INFECTED WITH HIV AND HBV, AND LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND HEPATOMEGALY



 See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.




Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir. Hepatic function should be monitored closely for at least several months after discontinuation. Initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 
           
   
      (5.1)



Entecavir is not recommended for patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who are not also receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), because of the potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 
           
   
      (5.2)



Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors. 
           
   
      (5.3)
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS





Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. 
          
  
     (5.1, 
          
  
     6.1)

Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. 
          
  
     (5.2)

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. 
          
  
     (5.3)










5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B 


Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir 
         
 
  [see 
          
  
   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]
         
 
  . Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 
        

 









5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV 


Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated 
         
 
  [see 
          
  
   Microbiology (12.4)]
         
 
  . Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.
        

 









5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis 


Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. 
Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





Nursing mothers: Discontinue nursing or entecavir taking into consideration the importance of entecavir to the mother.  
     (8.3)


Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s Baraclude 
    ® (entecavir) tablets. However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.
   








8.1 Pregnancy 



Pregnancy Category C 

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of entecavir in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, entecavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 

Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry: To monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to entecavir, an 
         
 
  Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263. 
        

 

Animal Data

Animal reproduction studies with entecavir in rats and rabbits revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Developmental toxicity studies were performed in rats and rabbits. There were no signs of embryofetal or maternal toxicity when pregnant animals received oral entecavir at approximately 28 (rat) and 212 (rabbit) times the human exposure achieved at the highest recommended human dose of 1 mg/day. In rats, maternal toxicity, embryofetal toxicity (resorptions), lower fetal body weights, tail and vertebral malformations, reduced ossification (vertebrae, sternebrae and phalanges) and extra lumbar vertebrae and ribs were observed at exposures 3100 times those in humans. In rabbits, embryofetal toxicity (resorptions), reduced ossification (hyoid) and an increased incidence of 13th rib were observed at exposures 883 times those in humans. In a peripostnatal study, no adverse effects on offspring occurred when rats received oral entecavir at exposures greater than 94 times those in humans.









8.2 Labor and Delivery 


There are no studies in pregnant women and no data on the effect of entecavir on transmission of HBV from mother to infant. Therefore, appropriate interventions should be used to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV. 









8.3 Nursing Mothers 


It is not known whether entecavir is excreted into human milk; however, entecavir is excreted into the milk of rats. Because many drugs are excreted into human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from entecavir, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue entecavir taking into consideration the importance of continued hepatitis B therapy to the mother and the known benefits of breastfeeding. 









8.4 Pediatric Use 


The efficacy and safety of entecavir have not been established in patients less than 2 years of age. Use of entecavir in this age group has not been evaluated because treatment of HBV in this age group is rarely required.
Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s Baraclude
         
 
  ® (entecavir) tablets. However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.
        

 









8.5 Geriatric Use 


Clinical studies of entecavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Entecavir is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function 
         
 
  [see 
          
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.4)]
         
 
  . 
        

 









8.6 Racial/Ethnic Groups 


There are no significant racial differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics. 









8.7 Renal Impairment

8.8 Liver Transplant Recipients 


If entecavir treatment is determined to be necessary for a liver transplant recipient who has received or is receiving an immunosuppressant that may affect renal function, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, renal function must be carefully monitored both before and during treatment with entecavir

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is limited experience of entecavir overdosage reported in patients. Healthy subjects who received single entecavir doses up to 40 mg or multiple doses up to 20 mg/day for up to 14 days had no increase in or unexpected adverse events. If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity, and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. 
Following a single 1 mg dose of entecavir, a 4-hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 13% of the entecavir dose.
