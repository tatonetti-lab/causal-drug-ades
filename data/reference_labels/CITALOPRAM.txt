6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
The safety for citalopram tablets included citalopram exposures in patients and/or healthy subjects from 3 different groups of studies: 429 healthy subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies; 4,422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, corresponding to approximately 1,370 patient-exposure years. There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram tablets varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure.

Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment

Among 1,063 patients with MDD who received citalopram tablets at doses ranging from 10 mg to 80 mg once daily in placebo- controlled trials of up to 6 weeks duration, 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, as compared to 8% of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse reactions associated with discontinuation (i.e., associated with discontinuation  in at least 1% of citalopram-treated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in
 
  Table 2.

*Adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of patients treated with citalopram are reported, except for the following adverse reactions which had an incidence on placebo ≥ citalopram: headache, asthenia, dizziness, constipation, palpitation, vision abnormal, sleep disorder, nervousness, pharyngitis, micturition disorder, back pain.

 

1Denominator used was for females only (N=638 citalopram; N=252 placebo).

 

2Primarily ejaculatory delay.

 

3Denominator used was for males only (N=425 citalopram; N=194 placebo).

 

Dose Dependent Adverse Reactions

The potential relationship between the dosage of citalopram and the incidence of adverse reactions was examined in a fixed-dose study in patients with MDD receiving placebo or citalopram tablets 10 mg, 20 mg 40 mg, or 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). A positive dose response (p<0.05) was revealed for the following adverse reactions: fatigue, impotence, insomnia, increased sweating, somnolence, and yawning.

Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs

Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence.
Table 4 displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of male patients taking citalopram tablets in a pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with depression.

In female depressed patients receiving citalopram tablets, the reported incidence of decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3% (n=638 females) and 1.1% (n=252 females), respectively.

Weight Changes

Patients treated with citalopram tablets in controlled trials experienced a weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients.

ECG Changes

In a thorough QT study, citalopram tablets were found to be associated with a dose-dependent increase in the QTc interval.
Electrocardiograms from citalopram (N=802) and placebo (N=241) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). In the citalopram group 1.9% of the patients had a change from baseline in QTcF >60 msec compared to 1.2% of the patients in the placebo group. None of the patients in the placebo group had a post-dose QTcF >500 msec compared to 0.5% of the patients in the citalopram group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.5% in the citalopram group and 0.4% in the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.9% in the citalopram group and 0.4% in the placebo group.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS








• QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes: Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram tablets in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram tablets in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms (
 
    5.2,
 
    7). 
      • Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram tablets and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive measures (
 
    
5.3
). 
      • Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk (
 
    
5.4
). 
      • Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder (
 
    
5.5
). 
      • Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder (
 
    
5.7
). 
      • Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of citalopram tablets in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles (
 
    
5.8
). 
      • Hyponatremia: Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (
 
    
5.9
). 
      • Sexual Dysfunction: Citalopram tablets may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. (

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk indentified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in
 
  Table 1.

*Citalopram tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients.
It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing citalopram tablets, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.








5.2 QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

Citalopram tablets cause dose-dependent QTc prolongation an ECG abnormality that has been associated with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)]
 
  .

 
Because of the risk of QTc prolongation at higher citalopram tablet doses, it is recommended that citalopram tablets not be given at doses above 40 mg once daily
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.2)]
 
  .

 
Citalopram tablets should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure unless the benefits outweigh the risks for a particular patient. Citalopram tablets should also be avoided in patients who are taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7)]
 
  . Such drugs include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

 
The citalopram dose should be limited in certain populations. The maximum dose should be limited to 20 mg once daily in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients receiving concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, since higher Citalopram exposures would be expected. The maximum dose should also be limited to 20 mg once daily in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are greater than 60 years of age because of expected higher exposures
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.3,
  
   2.4), Drug Interactions (
  
   7), Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  .

 
Electrolyte and/or ECG monitoring is recommended in certain circumstances. Patients being considered for treatment with citalopram tablets who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements with periodic monitoring. Hypokalemia (and/or hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmia, and should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients for whom citalopram use is not recommended unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks for a particular patient (see above). These include those patients with the cardiac conditions noted above, and those taking other drugs that may prolong the QTc interval.
Discontinue citalopram tablets in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements >500 ms. If patients taking citalopram tablets experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, including cardiac monitoring.








5.3 Serotonin Syndrome


SSRIs, including citalopram tablets, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs
 
   [see Contraindications (
  
    4), Drug Interactions (
  
    7)]
 
   . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome were noted in 0.1% of MDD patients treated with citalopram tablets in premarketing clinical trials.

  

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
The concomitant use of citalopram tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate citalopram tablets in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking citalopram tablets, discontinue citalopram tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4), Drug Interactions (
  
   7)]
 
  .

 
Monitor all patients taking citalopram tablets for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with citalopram tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of citalopram tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.








5.4 Increased Risk of Bleeding


Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including citalopram tablets, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage
 
   [see Use in Specific Populations (
  
    8.1)]
 
   . Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

  

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7)]
 
  .

 








5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with citalopram tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.1% of undiagnosed patients treated with citalopram tablets. Prior to initiating treatment with citalopram tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.2)]
 
  .

 








5.6 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 








5.7 Seizures

Citalopram tablets have not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. In clinical trials of citalopram tablets, seizures occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with citalopram tablets (a rate of one patient per 98 years of exposure) and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo (a rate of one patient per 50 years of exposure). Citalopram tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.








5.8 Angle-closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including citalopram tablets, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including citalopram tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.








5.9 Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including citalopram tablets. Cases of serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue citalopram tablets and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs
 
  [see Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.5)]
 
  .

 








5.10 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including citalopram tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1)]
 
  . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. 
    It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of citalopram tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS







Pregnancy:SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate 
  
     (
   
      8.1).
  
     









8.1 Pregnancy


Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at
 
  https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants
.


Risk Summary

Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.4) and Clinical Considerations]
 
  .

 
Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
 
  (see Data)and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy
 
  .There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy
 
  (see Clinical Considerations).

 
In animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity
 
  (see Data).

 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations


Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.

Maternal Adverse Reactions
  Use of citalopram tablet in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.4)]
 
  .

 

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Neonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.3)]

Data


Human Data

Exposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1- 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Animal Data

Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m
 
  2body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.

 
Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m
 
  2body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.

 
Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m
 
  2body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses ≥ 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.

 








8.2 Lactation


Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss
 
  (see Clinical Considerations).There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.

 
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.








8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.
Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients
 
  [see
Boxed Warning,
Warnings 
and Precautions
(
  
   5.1)]
 
  . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.

 








8.5 Geriatric Use

Of 4,422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1,357 were 60 and over, 1,034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects ≥ 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.3), Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.2)]
 
  .

 
SSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.9)]
 
  .

 








8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Increased citalopram exposure occurs in patients with hepatic impairment. The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is lower in patients with hepatic impairment
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGE

The following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:


Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.
Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co‐ingestants including alcohol.
Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).

Prolonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1‐800‐221‐2222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.
