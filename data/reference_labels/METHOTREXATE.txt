6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials and other studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Common adverse reactions were: ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other clinically relevant adverse reactions were infection, malaise, fatigue, chills, fever, and dizziness.


Rheumatoid Arthritis


The most common adverse reactions of methotrexate that exceeded the rate of placebo in 12 to 18 week double-blind studies in patients (n=128) with rheumatoid arthritis are listed below.
Patients received methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg orally once weekly. Most patients received concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some also received corticosteroids. Hepatic histology was not examined in these short-term studies.
Incidence ≥10%:                     Elevated liver tests 15%, nausea/vomiting 10%
Incidence 3% to <10%:           Stomatitis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/mm
 
  3)

 
Incidence 1% to <3%:             Rash/pruritus/dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, leukopenia (white blood cell count < 3000/mm
 
  3), pancytopenia, dizziness

 
Two other controlled trials of patients (n=680) with rheumatoid arthritis who received methotrexate 7.5 mg to 15 mg orally once weekly showed the following serious adverse reaction:
Incidence 1%:                           Interstitial pneumonitis
Other less common adverse reactions were: anemia, headache, upper respiratory infection, anorexia, arthralgias, chest pain, coughing, dysuria, eye discomfort, epistaxis, fever, infection, sweating, tinnitus, vaginal discharge.


Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)


The most common adverse reactions reported in patients 2 to 18 years of age with pJIA treated with methotrexate 5 mg/m
 
  2to 20 mg/m
 
  2orally once weekly or 0.1 to 0.65 mg/kg orally once weekly were as follows: elevated liver tests 14%; gastrointestinal reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 11%; stomatitis 2%; leukopenia 2%; headache 1.2%; alopecia 0.5%; dizziness 0.2%; rash 0.2%. Most patients received concomitant NSAIDs and some also received corticosteroids.

 


Psoriasis


In two published series of adults with psoriasis (n=204, 248) who received methotrexate up to 25 mg per week for up to 4 years, adverse reaction rates were similar to those in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, except for alopecia, photosensitivity, and "burning of skin lesions" (3% to 10% each). Painful plaque erosions have been reported.

   [see Contraindications (
  
    4), Use in Specific Populations (
  
    8.1,
  
    8.3)]
 
   .

  








5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions


Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur with methotrexate
 
   [see Contraindications (
  
    4), Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.1)]
 
   .

  

If anaphylaxis or other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue methotrexate tablets
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.3 Myelosuppression


Methotrexate suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.1)]
 
   .

  

Obtain blood counts at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for clinical complications of myelosuppression. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue methotrexate tablets taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.4 Gastrointestinal Toxicity


Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomatitis occurred in up to 10% of patients receiving methotrexate for treatment of non-neoplastic diseases. Hemorrhagic enteritis and fatal intestinal perforation have been reported
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.1,
  
    6.2)]
 
   . Patients with peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis are at a greater risk of developing severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions
 
   [see Drug Interactions (
  
    7.1)]
 
   .

  

Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for severe gastrointestinal toxicity taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.5 Hepatotoxicity

Methotrexate can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1)]
 
  . The safety of methotrexate tablets in patients with hepatic disease is unknown.

 

The risk of hepatotoxicity is increased with heavy alcohol consumption. In patients with psoriasis, fibrosis or cirrhosis may occur in the absence of symptoms or abnormal liver tests; the risk of hepatotoxicity appears to increase with total cumulative dose and generally occurs after receipt of a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g or more.

Monitor liver tests at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity


Pulmonary toxicity, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible or fatal cases, can occur with methotrexate
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.1,
  
    6.2)]
 
   .

  

Monitor patients for pulmonary toxicity and withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.7 Dermatologic Reactions


Severe, including fatal dermatologic reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, skin necrosis, and erythema multiforme, can occur with methotrexate
 
   [see
Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.1,
  
    6.2)]
 
   .

  

Exposure to ultraviolet radiation while taking methotrexate may aggravate psoriasis. Methotrexate can cause radiation recall dermatitis and photodermatitis (sunburn) reactivation.
Monitor patients for dermatologic toxicity and withhold or permanently discontinue methotrexate tablets for severe dermatologic reactions taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  . Advise patients to avoid excessive sun exposure and use sun protection measures.

 







5.8 Renal Toxicity


Methotrexate can cause renal toxicity, including irreversible acute renal failure
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.2)]
 
   .

  

Monitor renal function at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for severe renal toxicity taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 
Administer glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (> 1 micromole per liter) and delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function. Refer to the glucarpidase prescribing information for additional information.







5.9 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Medication Error

Deaths occurred in patients as a result of medication errors. Most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed.
For patients prescribed a once weekly dosing regimen, instruct patients and caregivers to take the recommended dosage as directed, because medication errors have led to death.







5.10 Folic Acid Supplementation




Neoplastic Diseases



Products containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Therefore, instruct patients not to take products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless directed to do so by their healthcare provider.


Non-neoplastic Diseases


Folate deficiency may increase methotrexate adverse reactions. Administer folic acid or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and psoriasis
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.3,
  
   2.4,
  
   2.5)]
 
  .

 







5.11 Serious Infections


Patients treated with methotrexate are at increased risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, including opportunistic infections such as
 
   Pneumocystis jirovecipneumonia, invasive fungal infections, hepatitis B reactivation, tuberculosis primary infection or reactivation, and disseminated
 
   Herpes zosterand cytomegalovirus infections
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.2)]
 
   .

  

Monitor patients for infection during and after treatment with methotrexate tablets. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for serious infections taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.12 Neurotoxicity


Methotrexate can cause severe acute and chronic neurotoxicity, which can be progressive, irreversible, and fatal
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.2)]
 
   . The risk of leukoencephalopathy is increased in patients who received prior cranial radiation.

  

Monitor patients for neurotoxicity and withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.13 Secondary Malignancies


Secondary malignancies can occur with methotrexate
 
   [see Adverse Reactions (
  
    6.2)]
 
   . The risk of cutaneous malignancies is further increased when cyclosporine is administered to patients with psoriasis who received prior methotrexate.

  

In some cases, lymphoproliferative disease occurring during therapy with low-dose methotrexate regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate. If lymphoproliferative disease occurs, discontinue methotrexate tablets
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.6)]
 
  .

 







5.14 Tumor Lysis Syndrome


Methotrexate can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Institute appropriate prophylactic measures in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome prior to initiation of methotrexate tablets.








5.15 Immunization and Risks Associated with Live Vaccines


Disseminated infections following administration of live vaccines have been reported. Immunization with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment. Follow current vaccination practice guidelines for administration of immunizations in patients receiving methotrexate tablets.

Update immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to initiating methotrexate tablets. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of methotrexate should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.







5.16 Infertility


Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction. It is not known if the infertility may be reversible. Discuss the risk of infertility with females and males of reproductive potential
 
   [see Use in Specific Populations (
  
    8.3)]
 
   .

  








5.17 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Third-Space Accumulation


Methotrexate accumulates in third-spaces (e.g., pleural effusions or ascites), which results in prolonged elimination and increases the risk of adverse reactions. Evacuate significant third- space accumulations prior to methotrexate tablets administration taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS





Lactation:Instruct not to breastfeed. (
 
    8.2)

   







8.1 Pregnancy



Risk Summary


Methotrexate tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women with non-neoplastic diseases
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4)]
 
  .

 
Based on published reports and its mechanism of action
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.1)]
 
  , methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies. Advise pregnant women with neoplastic diseases of the potential risk to a fetus.

 
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.


Data



Human Data

Published data from case reports, literature reviews, and observational studies report that methotrexate exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death. Methotrexate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and multiple adverse developmental outcomes, including skull anomalies, facial dysmorphism, central nervous system abnormalities, limb abnormalities, and sometimes cardiac anomalies and intellectual impairment. Adverse outcomes associated with exposure during second and third trimesters of pregnancy include intrauterine growth restriction and functional abnormalities. Because methotrexate is widely distributed and persists in the body for a prolonged period, there is a potential risk to the fetus from preconception methotrexate exposure.
A prospective multicenter study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in women taking methotrexate less than or equal to 30 mg/week after conception. The rate of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate was 42% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29, 59), which was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (22%; 95% CI: 17, 30) and unexposed patients with nonautoimmune disease (17%; 95% CI: 13, 23). Of the live births, the rate of major birth defects in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate after conception was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8 [95% CI: 0.6, 6]) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (adjusted OR 3.1 [95% CI: 1, 10]) (2.9%). Major birth defects associated with pregnancies exposed to methotrexate after conception were not always consistent with methotrexate-associated adverse developmental outcomes.







8.2 Lactation



Risk Summary


Limited published literature report the presence of methotrexate in human milk in low amounts, with the highest breast milk to plasma concentration ratio reported to be 0.08:1. There are no data on the effects of methotrexate or its metabolites on the breastfed child or their effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, instruct women not to breastfeed during treatment with methotrexate tablets and for 1 week after the final dose.







8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Methotrexate can cause malformations and fetal death at doses less than or equal to the recommended clinical doses
 
  [Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.1)]
 
  .

 


Pregnancy Testing


Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating methotrexate tablets
 
  [see Contraindications (
  
   4), Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.1)]
 
  .

 


Contraception



Females

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with methotrexate tablets and for 6 months after the final dose.

Males

Methotrexate can cause chromosomal damage to sperm cells. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with methotrexate tablets and for 3 months after the final dose.


Infertility



Females

Based on published reports of female infertility after methotrexate, advise females of reproductive potential that methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility and menstrual dysfunction during treatment with methotrexate tablets and after the final dose. It is not known if the infertility may be reversed in all affected females.

Males

Based on published reports of male infertility after methotrexate, advise males that methotrexate can cause oligospermia or infertility during treatment with methotrexate tablets and after the final dose. It is not known if the infertility may be reversed in all affected males.








8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of methotrexate tablets in pediatric patients have been established for the treatment of ALL as part of the combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen and the treatment of pJIA
 
  [see Indications and Usage (
  
   1), Dosage and Administration (
  
   2)]
 
  . No new safety signals have been observed in pediatric patients in clinical studies
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.1)]
 
  .

 
The safety and effectiveness of methotrexate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for the other indications
 
  [see Indications and Usage (
  
   1)]
 
  .

 








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of methotrexate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.







8.6 Renal Impairment

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with renal impairment
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . Patients with renal impairment are at increased risk for methotrexate adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) less than 90 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault] for adverse reactions. Reduce the dosage or discontinue methotrexate tablets as appropriate
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.8)]
 
  .

 







8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and safety of methotrexate in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk for methotrexate adverse reactions based on the elimination characteristics of methotrexate
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  . Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment for adverse reactions. Reduce the dosage or discontinue methotrexate tablets as appropriate
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.5)]
 
  .
10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage, including fatal overdosage, has occurred with methotrexate
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5. 9)]
 
  .

 


Manifestations


Manifestations of methotrexate overdosage include adverse reactions reported at pharmacologic doses, particularly hematologic and gastrointestinal reactions (e.g., leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, myelosuppression, mucositis, stomatitis, oral ulceration, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal ulceration, or gastrointestinal bleeding). In some cases, no symptoms were reported; however, sepsis or septic shock, renal failure, and aplastic anemia were also reported.


Management


Leucovorin and levoleucovorin are indicated for diminishing the methotrexate adverse reactions of methotrexate overdosage. Administer leucovorin or levoleucovorin as soon as possible after methotrexate overdosage). Monitor serum creatinine and methotrexate levels to guide leucovorin or levoleucovorin therapy. Refer to the leucovorin or levoleucovorin prescribing information for additional dosage information.
Glucarpidase is indicated for the treatment of toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (>1 micromole per liter) in patients with delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function. Refer to the glucarpidase prescribing information for additional dosage information.
Administer concomitant hydration and urinary alkalinization.
Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis has been shown to improve methotrexate elimination; however, methotrexate has been effectively cleared with acute, intermittent hemodialysis using a high-flux dialyzer.
