6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of CANCIDAS cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.









Clinical Trials Experience in Adults


The overall safety of CANCIDAS was assessed in 1865 adult individuals who received single or multiple doses of CANCIDAS: 564 febrile, neutropenic patients (empirical therapy study); 382 patients with candidemia and/or intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections (including 4 patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis); 297 patients with esophageal and/or oropharyngeal candidiasis; 228 patients with invasive aspergillosis; and 394 individuals in phase I studies. In the empirical therapy study patients had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy. In the studies involving patients with documented Candida infections, the majority of the patients had serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic or other malignancy, recent major surgery, HIV) requiring multiple concomitant medications. Patients in the noncomparative Aspergillus studies often had serious predisposing medical conditions (e.g., bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplants, hematologic malignancy, solid tumors or organ transplants) requiring multiple concomitant medications.









Empirical Therapy for Presumed Fungal Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Patients


In the randomized, double-blinded empirical therapy study, patients received either CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose) or AmBisome® (amphotericin B liposome for injection, 3 mg/kg/day). In this study clinical or laboratory hepatic adverse reactions were reported in 39% and 45% of patients in the CANCIDAS and AmBisome groups, respectively. Also reported was an isolated, serious adverse reaction of hyperbilirubinemia. Adverse reactions occurring in 7.5% or greater of the patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2.

The proportion of patients who experienced an infusion-related adverse reaction (defined as a systemic event, such as pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, dyspnea, tachypnea, rash, or anaphylaxis, that developed during the study therapy infusion and one hour following infusion) was significantly lower in the group treated with CANCIDAS (35%) than in the group treated with AmBisome (52%).
To evaluate the effect of CANCIDAS and AmBisome on renal function, nephrotoxicity was defined as doubling of serum creatinine relative to baseline or an increase of greater than or equal to 1 mg/dL in serum creatinine if baseline serum creatinine was above the upper limit of the normal range. Among patients whose baseline creatinine clearance was greater than 30 mL/min, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly lower in the group treated with CANCIDAS (3%) than in the group treated with AmBisome (12%).











Candidemia and Other Candida Infections


In the randomized, double-blinded invasive candidiasis study, patients received either CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose) or amphotericin B 0.6 to 1 mg/kg/day. Adverse reactions occurring in 10% or greater of the patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 3.

In a subgroup of patients whose baseline creatinine clearance was greater than 30 mL/min, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly lower in the group treated with CANCIDAS than in the group treated with amphotericin B.
In a second randomized, double-blinded invasive candidiasis study, patients received either CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose) or CANCIDAS 150 mg/day. The proportion of patients who experienced any adverse reaction was similar in the 2 treatment groups; however, this study was not large enough to detect differences in rare or unexpected adverse reactions. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% or greater of the patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 4.

Invasive Aspergillosis


In an open-label, noncomparative aspergillosis study, in which 69 patients received CANCIDAS (70-mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 50 mg daily), the following adverse reactions were observed with an incidence of 12.5% or greater: blood alkaline phosphatase increased (22%), hypotension (20%), respiratory failure (20%), pyrexia (17%), diarrhea (15%), nausea (15%), headache (15%), rash (13%), alanine aminotransferase increased (13%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (13%), blood bilirubin increased (13%), and blood potassium decreased (13%). Also reported in this patient population were pulmonary edema, ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome), and radiographic infiltrates.













Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients (3 months to 17 years of age)


The overall safety of CANCIDAS was assessed in 171 pediatric patients who received single or multiple doses of CANCIDAS. The distribution among the 153 pediatric patients who were over the age of 3 months was as follows: 104 febrile, neutropenic patients; 38 patients with candidemia and/or intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections; 1 patient with esophageal candidiasis; and 10 patients with invasive aspergillosis. The overall safety profile of CANCIDAS in pediatric patients is comparable to that in adult patients. Table 6 shows the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 7.5% or greater of pediatric patients in clinical studies.
One patient (0.6%) receiving CANCIDAS, and three patients (12%) receiving AmBisome developed a serious drug-related adverse reaction. Two patients (1%) were discontinued from CANCIDAS and three patients (12%) were discontinued from AmBisome due to a drug-related adverse reaction. The proportion of patients who experienced an infusion-related adverse reaction (defined as a systemic event, such as pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, dyspnea, tachypnea, rash, or anaphylaxis, that developed during the study therapy infusion and one hour following infusion) was 22% in the group treated with CANCIDAS and 35% in the group treated with AmBisome.

Overall Safety Experience of CANCIDAS in Clinical Trials


The overall safety of CANCIDAS was assessed in 2036 individuals (including 1642 adult or pediatric patients and 394 volunteers) from 34 clinical studies. These individuals received single or multiple (once daily) doses of CANCIDAS, ranging from 5 mg to 210 mg. Full safety data is available from 1951 individuals, as the safety data from 85 patients enrolled in 2 compassionate use studies was limited solely to serious adverse reactions. Adverse reactions which occurred in 5% or greater of all individuals who received CANCIDAS in these trials are shown in Table 7.
Overall, 1665 of the 1951 (85%) patients/volunteers who received CANCIDAS experienced an adverse reaction.

Table 7: Adverse ReactionsDefined as an adverse reaction, regardless of causality, while on CANCIDAS or during the 14-day post-CANCIDAS follow-up period. in Patients Who Received CANCIDAS in Clinical TrialsIncidence for each preferred term is 5% or greater among individuals who received at least 1 dose of CANCIDAS. Incidence 5% or Greater for at Least One Treatment Group

Gastrointestinal disorders: pancreatitis

Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic necrosis

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and skin exfoliation

Renal and urinary disorders: clinically significant renal dysfunction

General disorders and administration site conditions
: swelling and peripheral edema

Laboratory abnormalities: gamma-glutamyltransferase increased
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS






Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth or bronchospasm, and cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of CANCIDAS. Discontinue CANCIDAS at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment. (5.1) 									

Hepatic Effects: Can cause abnormalities in liver enzymes. Isolated cases of hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, or hepatic failure have been reported. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes for evidence of worsening hepatic function, and evaluate risk/benefit of continuing CANCIDAS. (5.2)

Elevated Liver Enzymes During Concomitant Use with Cyclosporine: Limit use to patients for whom potential benefit outweighs potential risk. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) during concomitant use with CANCIDAS. (5.3)








5.1	Hypersensitivity

									Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during administration of CANCIDAS. 								
									Possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth or bronchospasm have been reported. 								
									Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with a fatal outcome, have been reported with use of CANCIDAS [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 								
									Discontinue CANCIDAS at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment. 								








5.2	Hepatic Effects

Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and in adult and pediatric patients treated with CANCIDAS. In some adult and pediatric patients with serious underlying conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications with CANCIDAS, isolated cases of clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure have been reported; a causal relationship to CANCIDAS has not been established. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during CANCIDAS therapy for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing CANCIDAS therapy.








5.3	Elevated Liver Enzymes During Concomitant Use With Cyclosporine

Elevated liver enzymes have occurred in patients receiving CANCIDAS and cyclosporine concomitantly. Only use CANCIDAS and cyclosporine in those patients for whom the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes during concomitant therapy should be monitored and the risk/benefit of continuing therapy should be evaluated.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS






Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. (8.1)

Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy in neonates and infants less than 3 months old have not been established. (8.4)

Hepatic Impairment: Reduce dose for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (35 mg once daily, with a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1 where appropriate). No data are available in adults with severe impairment or in pediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. (2.4, 8.6, 12.3)








8.1 Pregnancy







Risk Summary

Based on animal data, CANCIDAS may cause fetal harm (see Data). There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with CANCIDAS use in pregnant women.
In animal studies, caspofungin caused embryofetal toxicity, including increased resorptions, increased peri-implantation loss, and incomplete ossification at multiple fetal sites  when administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 0.8 and 2 times the clinical dose, respectively (see Data
). Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus.
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.










Data









Animal Data

In animal reproduction studies, pregnant rats dosed intravenously with caspofungin during organogenesis (gestational days [GD] 6 to 20) at 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (up to 0.8 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) showed increased resorptions and peri-implantation losses at 5 mg/kg/day. Incomplete ossification of the skull and torso and increased incidences of cervical rib  were noted in offspring born to pregnant rats treated at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day. In pregnant rabbits treated with intravenous caspofungin during organogenesis (GD 7 to 20) at doses of 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), increased fetal resorptions and increased incidence of incomplete ossification of the talus/calcaneus in offspring were observed at the highest dose tested. Caspofungin crossed the placenta in rats and rabbits and was detectable in fetal plasma.
In peri- and postnatal development study in rats, intravenous caspofungin administered at 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg/day from Day 6 of gestation through Day 20 of lactation was not associated with any adverse effects on reproductive performance or subsequent development of first generation (F1) offspring or malformations in second generation (F2) offspring.












8.2 Lactation







Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of caspofungin in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Caspofungin was found in the milk of lactating, drug-treated rats.
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CANCIDAS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CANCIDAS or from the underlying maternal condition.










8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of CANCIDAS in pediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age are supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients, and additional data from prospective studies in pediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age for the following indications [see Indications and Usage (1)]:


Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropenic patients.
Treatment of candidemia and the following Candida infections: intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, and pleural space infections.
Treatment of esophageal candidiasis.
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of other therapies (e.g., amphotericin B, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, itraconazole).

The efficacy and safety of CANCIDAS has not been adequately studied in prospective clinical trials involving neonates and infants under 3 months of age. Although limited pharmacokinetic data were collected in neonates and infants below 3 months of age, these data are insufficient to establish a safe and effective dose of caspofungin in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. Invasive candidiasis in neonates has a higher rate of CNS and multi-organ involvement than in older patients; the ability of CANCIDAS to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and to treat patients with meningitis and endocarditis is unknown.
CANCIDAS has not been studied in pediatric patients with endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis due to Candida. CANCIDAS has also not been studied as initial therapy for invasive aspergillosis in pediatric patients.
In clinical trials, 171 pediatric patients (0 months to 17 years of age), including 18 patients who were less than 3 months of age, were given intravenous CANCIDAS. Pharmacokinetic studies enrolled a total of 66 pediatric patients, and an additional 105 pediatric patients received CANCIDAS in safety and efficacy studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The majority of the pediatric patients received CANCIDAS at a once-daily maintenance dose of 50 mg/m2 for a mean duration of 12 days (median 9, range 1-87 days). In all studies, safety was assessed by the investigator throughout study therapy and for 14 days following cessation of study therapy. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients treated with CANCIDAS were pyrexia (29%), blood potassium decreased (15%), diarrhea (14%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (12%), rash (12%), increased alanine aminotransferase (11%), hypotension (11%), and chills (11%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Postmarketing hepatobiliary adverse reactions have been reported in pediatric patients with serious underlying medical conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].








8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of CANCIDAS did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Although the number of elderly patients was not large enough for a statistical analysis, no overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these and younger patients. Plasma concentrations of caspofungin in healthy older men and women (65 years of age and older) were increased slightly (approximately 28% in AUC) compared to young healthy men. A similar effect of age on pharmacokinetics was seen in patients with candidemia or other Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis, or pleural space infections). No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly; however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.








8.6	Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) do not need a dosage adjustment. For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), CANCIDAS 35 mg once daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, where recommended, a 70-mg loading dose should still be administered on Day 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) and in pediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age with any degree of hepatic impairment.








8.7	Patients with Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Caspofungin is not dialyzable; thus, supplementary dosing is not required following hemodialysis [see 

Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGE

In 6 healthy subjects who received a single 210-mg dose, no significant adverse reactions were reported. Multiple doses above 150 mg daily have not been studied. Caspofungin is not dialyzable.
In clinical trials, one pediatric patient (16 years of age) unintentionally received a single dose of caspofungin of 113 mg (on Day 1), followed by 80 mg daily for an additional 7 days. No clinically significant adverse reactions were reported.
