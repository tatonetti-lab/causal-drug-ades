This is most likely due to a direct interference with cholesterol synthesis. However, the serum sterols in patients receiving the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate are not significantly altered. Ovarian cancer has been infrequently reported in patients who have received fertility drugs. Infertility is a primary risk factor for ovarian cancer; however, epidemiology data suggest that prolonged use of clomiphene may increase the risk of a borderline or invasive ovarian tumor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPostmarketing Adverse Events\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during the post approval use of clomiphene citrate.

These visual symptoms increase in incidence with increasing total dose or therapy duration. These visual disturbances are usually reversible; however, cases of prolonged visual disturbance have been reported with some occurring after clomiphene citrate discontinuation. The visual disturbances may be irreversible, especially with increased dosage or duration of therapy. Patients should be warned that these visual symptoms may render such activities as driving a car or operating machinery more hazardous than usual, particularly under conditions of variable lighting.\\\\nThese visual symptoms appear to be due to intensification and prolongation of after-images. Symptoms often first appear or are accentuated with exposure to a brightly lit environment. While measured visual acuity usually has not been affected, a study patient taking 200 mg clomiphene citrate daily developed visual blurring on the 7th day of treatment, which progressed to severe diminution of visual acuity by the 10th day. No other abnormality was found, and the visual acuity returned to normal on the 3rd day after treatment was stopped.\\\\nOphthalmologically definable scotomata and retinal cell function (electroretinographic) changes have also been reported. A patient treated during clinical studies developed phosphenes and scotomata during prolonged clomiphene citrate administration, which disappeared by the 32nd day after stopping therapy.\\\\nPostmarketing surveillance of adverse events has also revealed other visual signs and symptoms during clomiphene citrate therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).\\\\nWhile the etiology of these visual symptoms is not yet understood, patients with any visual symptoms should discontinue treatment and have a complete ophthalmological evaluation carried out promptly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOvarianHyperstimulationSyndrome\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been reported to occur in patients receiving clomiphene citrate therapy for ovulation induction. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) and become a serious medical disorder. In some cases, OHSS occurred following cyclic use of clomiphene citrate therapy or when clomiphene citrate was used in combination with gonadotropins. Transient liver function test abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, which may be accompanied by morphologic changes on liver biopsy, have been reported in association with OHSS.\\\\nOHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. The clinical signs of this syndrome in severe cases can include gross ovarian enlargement, gastrointestinal symptoms, ascites, dyspnea, oliguria, and pleural effusion. In addition, the following symptoms have been reported in association with this syndrome: pericardial effusion, anasarca, hydrothorax, acute abdomen, hypotension, renal failure, pulmonary edema, intraperitoneal and ovarian hemorrhage, deep venous thrombosis, torsion of the ovary, and acute respiratory distress. The early warning signs of OHSS are abdominal pain and distention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight gain. Elevated urinary steroid levels, varying degrees of electrolyte imbalance, hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, and hypoproteinemia may occur. Death due to hypovolemic shock, hemoconcentration, or thromboembolism has occurred. Due to fragility of enlarged ovaries in severe cases, abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed very cautiously. If conception results, rapid progression to the severe form of the syndrome may occur.\\\\nTo minimize the hazard associated with occasional abnormal ovarian enlargement associated with clomiphene citrate therapy, the lowest dose consistent with expected clinical results should be used. Maximal enlargement of the ovary, whether physiologic or abnormal, may not occur until several days after discontinuation of the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate. Some patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are unusually sensitive to gonadotropin may have an exaggerated response to usual doses of clomiphene citrate. Therefore, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should be started on the lowest recommended dose and shortest treatment duration for the first course of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\\\\nIf enlargement of the ovary occurs, additional clomiphene citrate therapy should not be given until the ovaries have returned to pretreatment size, and the dosage or duration of the next course should be reduced. Ovarian enlargement and cyst formation associated with clomiphene citrate therapy usually regress spontaneously within a few days or weeks after discontinuing treatment. The potential benefit of subsequent clomiphene citrate therapy in these cases should exceed the risk. Unless surgical indication for laparotomy exists, such cystic enlargement should always be managed conservatively.\\\\nA causal relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation and ovarian cancer has not been determined. However, because a correlation between ovarian cancer and nulliparity, infertility, and age has been suggested, if ovarian cysts do not regress spontaneously, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasia.\", \"PR\": \"PRECAUTIONS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeneral\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCareful attention should be given to the selection of candidates for clomiphene citrate therapy. Pelvic examination is necessary prior to clomiphene citrate treatment and before each subsequent course (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInformation for Patients\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose and risks of clomiphene citrate therapy should be presented to the patient before starting treatment. It should be emphasized that the goal of clomiphene citrate therapy is ovulation for subsequent pregnancy. The physician should counsel the patient with special regard to the following potential risks:\\\\n\\\\nVisual Symptoms: Advise that blurring or other visual symptoms occasionally may occur during or shortly after clomiphene citrate therapy. It should be made clear to the patient that, in some instances, visual disturbances may be prolonged, and possibly irreversible, especially with increased dosage or duration of therapy. Warn that visual symptoms may render such activities as driving a car or operating machinery more hazardous than usual, particularly under conditions of variable lighting (see\\\\u00a0\\\\nWARNINGS\\\\n).\\\\nThe patient should be instructed to inform the physician whenever any unusual visual symptoms occur. If the patient has any visual symptoms, treatment should be discontinued and complete ophthalmologic evaluation performed.\\\\n\\\\nAbdominal/Pelvic Pain or Distention: Ovarian enlargement may occur during or shortly after therapy with clomiphene citrate. To minimize the risks associated with ovarian enlargement, the patient should be instructed to inform the physician of any abdominal or pelvic pain, weight gain, discomfort, or distention after taking clomiphene citrate (see \\\\nWARNINGS\\\\n).\\\\n\\\\nMetabolism Disorders: Cases of hypertriglyceridemia have been reported. Preexisting or family history of hyperlipidemia and use of higher than recommended dose and/or longer duration of treatment with clomiphene citrate are associated with a risk of hypertriglyceridemia. Periodic monitoring of plasma triglycerides is recommended in patients with preexisting or family history of hyperlipidemia (see \\\\nADVERSE REACTIONS\\\\n). Pretreatment screening of triglyceride levels is recommended in patients initiating clomiphene citrate therapy.\\\\n\\\\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Cases of pancreatitis have been reported.\\\\n\\\\nMultiple Pregnancy: Inform the patient that there is an increased chance of multiple pregnancy, including bilateral tubal pregnancy and coexisting tubal and intrauterine pregnancy, when conception occurs in relation to clomiphene citrate therapy. The potential complications and hazards of multiple pregnancy should be explained.\\\\n\\\\nSpontaneous Abortion and Congenital Anomalies: Inform the patient that the available data suggest no increase in the rates of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or congenital anomalies with maternal clomiphene citrate use compared to rates in the general population.\\\\nDuring clinical investigation, the experience from  patients with known pregnancy outcome (Table 1) shows a spontaneous abortion rate of 20.4% and stillbirth rate of 1.0%. (See \\\\nCLINICAL STUDIES\\\\n). Among the birth anomalies spontaneously reported as individual cases since commercial availability of clomiphene citrate, the proportion of neural tube defects has been high among pregnancies associated with ovulation induced by clomiphene citrate, but this has not been supported by data from population-based studies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDrug Interactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDrug interactions with clomiphene citrate have not been documented.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-term toxicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of clomiphene citrate.\\\\nOral administration of clomiphene citrate to male rats at doses of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day caused decreased fertility, while higher doses caused temporary infertility. Oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in female rats temporarily interrupted the normal cyclic vaginal smear pattern and prevented conception. Doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day slightly reduced the number of ovulated ova and corpora lutea, while 3 mg/kg/day inhibited ovulation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPregnancy\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFetal Risk Summary\\\\n\\\\nClomiphene citrate use in pregnant women is contraindicated, as clomiphene citrate treatment does not offer benefit in this population. \\\\nAvailable human data do not suggest an increased risk for congenital anomalies above the background population risk. However, animal reproductive toxicology studies showed increased embryo-fetal loss and structural malformations in offspring. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus.\\\\n\\\\nClinical Considerations\\\\n\\\\nTo avoid inadvertent clomiphene citrate administration during early pregnancy, appropriate tests should be utilized during each treatment cycle to determine whether ovulation and/or pregnancy occurs. Patients should be evaluated carefully to exclude ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst formation between each treatment cycle. The next course of clomiphene citrate therapy should be delayed until these conditions have been excluded.\\\\nHuman Data\\\\nThe available human data from epidemiologic studies do not show any apparent cause and effect relationship between clomiphene citrate periconceptual exposure and an increased risk of overall birth defects, or any specific anomaly. However, due to the small number of cases of congenital anomalies occurring in clomiphene citrate treated women, these epidemiologic studies were only able to rule out large differences in risk. The studies did not consider factors associated with female subfertility and were unable to adjust for other important confounders.\\\\nIn addition, available data do not support an increase rate of spontaneous abortion among subfertile women treated with clomiphene for ovulation induction.\\\\nAnimal Data\\\\nOral administration of clomiphene citrate to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day resulted in hydramnion and weak, edematous fetuses with wavy ribs and other temporary bone changes. Doses of 8 mg/kg/day or more also caused increased resorptions and dead fetuses, dystocia, and delayed parturition, and 40 mg/kg/day resulted in increased maternal mortality. Single doses of 50 mg/kg caused fetal cataracts, while 200 mg/kg caused cleft palate.\\\\nFollowing injection of clomiphene citrate 2 mg/kg to mice and rats during pregnancy, the offspring exhibited metaplastic changes of the reproductive tract.  Newborn mice and rats injected during the first few days of life also developed metaplastic changes in uterine and vaginal mucosa, as well as premature vaginal opening and anovulatory ovaries. These findings are similar to the abnormal reproductive behavior and sterility described with other estrogens and antiestrogens.\\\\nIn rabbits, some temporary bone alterations were seen in fetuses from dams given oral doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg/day during pregnancy, but not following 8 mg/kg/day. No permanent malformations were observed in those studies. Also, rhesus monkeys given oral doses of 1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/day for various periods during pregnancy did not have any abnormal offspring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNursing Mothers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt is not known whether clomiphene citrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised if clomiphene citrate is administered to a nursing woman. In some patients, clomiphene citrate may reduce lactation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOvarian Cancer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProlonged use of clomiphene citrate tablets USP may increase the risk of a borderline or invasive ovarian tumor (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).\", \"OV\": \"OVERDOSAGE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSigns and Symptoms\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nToxic effects accompanying acute overdosage of clomiphene citrate have not been reported. Signs and symptoms of overdosage as a result of the use of more than the recommended dose during clomiphene citrate therapy include nausea, vomiting, vasomotor flushes, visual blurring, spots or flashes, scotomata, ovarian enlargement with pelvic or abdominal pain. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS: Ovarian Cyst.)\\\\n\\\\nOral LD50. The acute oral LD50 of clomiphene citrate is 1700 mg/kg in mice and 5750 mg/kg in rats. The toxic dose in humans is not known.\\\\n\\\\nDialysis. It is not known if clomiphene citrate is dialyzable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTreatment\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn the event of overdose, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination.\"}', metadata={'source': '/Users/undinagisladottir/Documents/Columbia/Tatonetti_Lab/causal-drug-ades/data/2024_latest_labels/latest_labels_ingredients/20240111_6370e342-16a5-4339-a13f-ba275fd5de09.json', 'seq_num': 1})]\n"

(5.2)\\nProlonged Urinary Retention and Transverse Myelitis: Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive care. (5.2)\\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive care for signs and symptoms of RPLS. (5.2)\\nCapillary Leak Syndrome and Hypotension:  Administer required prehydration and monitor patients closely during treatment.  Depending upon severity, manage by interruption, infusion rate reduction, or permanent discontinuation. (5.3, 5.4)\\nInfection:  Interrupt until resolution of systemic infection. (5.5)\\nBone Marrow Suppression:  Monitor peripheral blood counts during Unituxin therapy. (5.6)\\nElectrolyte Abnormalities:  Monitor serum electrolytes closely. (5.7)\\nAtypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome:  Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management. (5.8)\\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity:  May cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.9, 8.1, 8.3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 Serious Infusion Reactions\\n\\nSerious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention, including blood pressure support, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin, included facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension.  Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin infusion.  Due to overlapping signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in some cases. \\nIn Study 1, Severe (Grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions occurred in 35 (26%) patients in the Unituxin/13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) group compared to 1 (1%) patient receiving RA alone.  Severe urticaria occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group but did not occur in the RA group.  Serious adverse reactions consistent with anaphylaxis and resulting in permanent discontinuation of Unituxin occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group.  Additionally, 1 (0.1%) patient had multiple cardiac arrests and died within 24 hours after having received Unituxin in Study 2.\\nPrior to each Unituxin dose, administer required intravenous hydration and premedication with antihistamines, analgesics, and antipyretics [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during and for at least 4 hours following completion of each Unituxin infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available.\\nFor mild to moderate infusion reactions, such as transient rash, fever, rigors, and localized urticaria, that respond promptly to antihistamines or antipyretics, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate and monitor closely.  Immediately interrupt or permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for severe or prolonged infusion reactions.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for life-threatening infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Neurotoxicity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPain\\n\\nIn Study 1, 114 (85%) patients treated in the Unituxin/RA group experienced pain despite pre-treatment with analgesics, including morphine sulfate infusion.  Severe (Grade 3) pain occurred in 68 (51%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients in the RA group.  Pain typically occurred during the Unituxin infusion and was most commonly reported as abdominal pain, generalized pain, extremity pain, back pain, neuralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and arthralgia.\\nPremedicate with analgesics, including intravenous opioids, prior to each dose of Unituxin and continue analgesics until 2 hours following completion of Unituxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\\nFor severe pain, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate to 0.875 mg/m2/hour.  Discontinue Unituxin if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeripheral Neuropathy\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients and severe peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group.  No patients treated with RA alone experienced severe peripheral neuropathy.  The duration and reversibility of peripheral neuropathy occurring in Study 1 was not documented.  In Study 3, no patients experienced peripheral motor neuropathy.  Among the 9 (9%) patients who experienced peripheral sensory neuropathy of any severity, the median (min, max) duration of peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 (3, 163) days.\\nIn a study of a related anti-GD2 antibody conducted in 12 adult patients with metastatic melanoma, 2 (13%) patients developed severe motor neuropathy.  One patient developed lower extremity weakness and inability to ambulate that persisted for approximately 6 weeks.  Another patient developed severe lower extremity weakness resulting in an inability to ambulate without assistance that lasted for approximately 16 weeks and neurogenic bladder that lasted for approximately 3 weeks.  Complete resolution of motor neuropathy was not documented in this case. \\nPermanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with peripheral motor neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater severity, Grade 3 sensory neuropathy that interferes with daily activities for more than 2 weeks, or Grade 4 sensory neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeurological Disorders of the Eye\\n\\nNeurological disorders of the eye experienced by 2 or more patients treated with Unituxin in Studies 1, 2, or 3 included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.\\nIn Study 1, 3 (2%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group experienced blurred vision, compared to no patients in the RA group.  Diplopia, mydriasis, and unequal pupillary size occurred in 1 patient each in the Unituxin/RA group, compared to no patients in the RA group.  The duration of eye disorders occurring in Study 1 was not documented.  In Study 3, eye disorders occurred in 16 (15%) patients, and in 3 (3%) patients resolution of the eye disorder was not documented.  Among the cases with documented resolution, the median duration of eye disorders was 4 days (range: 0, 221 days).\\nInterrupt Unituxin in patients experiencing dilated pupil with sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances that do not cause visual loss.  Upon resolution and if continued treatment with Unituxin is warranted, decrease the Unituxin dose by 50%.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with recurrent signs or symptoms of an eye disorder following dose reduction and in patients who experience loss of vision [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProlonged Urinary Retention\\n\\nUrinary retention that persists for weeks to months following discontinuation of opioids has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with urinary retention that does not resolve following discontinuation of opioids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransverse Myelitis\\n\\nTransverse myelitis has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Promptly evaluate any patient with signs or symptoms of transverse myelitis, such as weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, or incontinence. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop transverse myelitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\\n\\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Institute appropriate medical treatment and permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with signs and symptoms of RPLS (eg, severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Capillary Leak Syndrome\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 to 5) capillary leak syndrome occurred in 31 (23%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone.  Additionally, capillary leak syndrome was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 9 (6%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone.  Immediately interrupt or discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management in patients with symptomatic or severe capillary leak syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Hypotension\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypotension occurred in 22 (16%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to no patients in the RA group.\\nPrior to each Unituxin infusion, administer required intravenous hydration.  Closely monitor blood pressure during Unituxin treatment.  Immediately interrupt or discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management in patients with symptomatic hypotension, systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than lower limit of normal for age, or SBP that is decreased by more than 15% compared to baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Infection\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) bacteremia requiring intravenous antibiotics or other urgent intervention occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients treated with RA alone.  Sepsis occurred in 24 (18%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in 10 (9%) patients in the RA group.\\nMonitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of systemic infection and temporarily discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop systemic infection until resolution of the infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6 Bone Marrow Suppression\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia (39% vs. 25%), anemia (34% vs. 16%), neutropenia (34% vs. 13%), and febrile neutropenia (4% vs. 0 patients) occurred more commonly in patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to patients treated with RA alone.  Monitor peripheral blood counts closely during therapy with Unituxin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.7 Electrolyte Abnormalities\\n\\nIn Study 1, electrolyte abnormalities occurring in at least 25% of patients who received Unituxin/RA included hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia.  Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypokalemia and hyponatremia occurred in 37% and 23% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group, respectively, compared to 2% and 4% of patients in the RA group.  In a study of a related anti-GD2 antibody conducted in 12 adult patients with metastatic melanoma, 2 (13%) patients developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion resulting in severe hyponatremia.  Monitor serum electrolytes daily during therapy with Unituxin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.8 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome\\n\\nHemolytic uremic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension occurred in 2 patients enrolled in Study 2 following receipt of the first cycle of Unituxin.  Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome recurred following rechallenge with Unituxin in 1 patient.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\\n\\nBased on its mechanism of action, Unituxin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for 2 months after the last dose of Unituxin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.9, 8.1, 8.3)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 Serious Infusion Reactions\\n\\nSerious infusion reactions requiring urgent intervention, including blood pressure support, bronchodilator therapy, corticosteroids, infusion rate reduction, infusion interruption, or permanent discontinuation of Unituxin, included facial and upper airway edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, urticaria, and hypotension.  Infusion reactions generally occurred during or within 24 hours of completing the Unituxin infusion.  Due to overlapping signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in some cases. \\nIn Study 1, Severe (Grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions occurred in 35 (26%) patients in the Unituxin/13-cis-retinoic acid (RA) group compared to 1 (1%) patient receiving RA alone.  Severe urticaria occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group but did not occur in the RA group.  Serious adverse reactions consistent with anaphylaxis and resulting in permanent discontinuation of Unituxin occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group.  Additionally, 1 (0.1%) patient had multiple cardiac arrests and died within 24 hours after having received Unituxin in Study 2.\\nPrior to each Unituxin dose, administer required intravenous hydration and premedication with antihistamines, analgesics, and antipyretics [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during and for at least 4 hours following completion of each Unituxin infusion in a setting where cardiopulmonary resuscitation medication and equipment are available.\\nFor mild to moderate infusion reactions, such as transient rash, fever, rigors, and localized urticaria, that respond promptly to antihistamines or antipyretics, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate and monitor closely.  Immediately interrupt or permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for severe or prolonged infusion reactions.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for life-threatening infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Neurotoxicity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPain\\n\\nIn Study 1, 114 (85%) patients treated in the Unituxin/RA group experienced pain despite pre-treatment with analgesics, including morphine sulfate infusion.  Severe (Grade 3) pain occurred in 68 (51%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients in the RA group.  Pain typically occurred during the Unituxin infusion and was most commonly reported as abdominal pain, generalized pain, extremity pain, back pain, neuralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, and arthralgia.\\nPremedicate with analgesics, including intravenous opioids, prior to each dose of Unituxin and continue analgesics until 2 hours following completion of Unituxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\\nFor severe pain, decrease the Unituxin infusion rate to 0.875 mg/m2/hour.  Discontinue Unituxin if pain is not adequately controlled despite infusion rate reduction and institution of maximum supportive measures [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeripheral Neuropathy\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3) peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients and severe peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 2 (1%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group.  No patients treated with RA alone experienced severe peripheral neuropathy.  The duration and reversibility of peripheral neuropathy occurring in Study 1 was not documented.  In Study 3, no patients experienced peripheral motor neuropathy.  Among the 9 (9%) patients who experienced peripheral sensory neuropathy of any severity, the median (min, max) duration of peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 (3, 163) days.\\nIn a study of a related anti-GD2 antibody conducted in 12 adult patients with metastatic melanoma, 2 (13%) patients developed severe motor neuropathy.  One patient developed lower extremity weakness and inability to ambulate that persisted for approximately 6 weeks.  Another patient developed severe lower extremity weakness resulting in an inability to ambulate without assistance that lasted for approximately 16 weeks and neurogenic bladder that lasted for approximately 3 weeks.  Complete resolution of motor neuropathy was not documented in this case. \\nPermanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with peripheral motor neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater severity, Grade 3 sensory neuropathy that interferes with daily activities for more than 2 weeks, or Grade 4 sensory neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeurological Disorders of the Eye\\n\\nNeurological disorders of the eye experienced by 2 or more patients treated with Unituxin in Studies 1, 2, or 3 included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.\\nIn Study 1, 3 (2%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group experienced blurred vision, compared to no patients in the RA group.  Diplopia, mydriasis, and unequal pupillary size occurred in 1 patient each in the Unituxin/RA group, compared to no patients in the RA group.  The duration of eye disorders occurring in Study 1 was not documented.  In Study 3, eye disorders occurred in 16 (15%) patients, and in 3 (3%) patients resolution of the eye disorder was not documented.  Among the cases with documented resolution, the median duration of eye disorders was 4 days (range: 0, 221 days).\\nInterrupt Unituxin in patients experiencing dilated pupil with sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances that do not cause visual loss.  Upon resolution and if continued treatment with Unituxin is warranted, decrease the Unituxin dose by 50%.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with recurrent signs or symptoms of an eye disorder following dose reduction and in patients who experience loss of vision [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProlonged Urinary Retention\\n\\nUrinary retention that persists for weeks to months following discontinuation of opioids has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with urinary retention that does not resolve following discontinuation of opioids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransverse Myelitis\\n\\nTransverse myelitis has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Promptly evaluate any patient with signs or symptoms of transverse myelitis, such as weakness, paresthesia, sensory loss, or incontinence. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop transverse myelitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\\n\\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has occurred in patients treated with Unituxin.  Institute appropriate medical treatment and permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients with signs and symptoms of RPLS (eg, severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Capillary Leak Syndrome\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 to 5) capillary leak syndrome occurred in 31 (23%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone.  Additionally, capillary leak syndrome was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 9 (6%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in no patients treated with RA alone.  Immediately interrupt or discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management in patients with symptomatic or severe capillary leak syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Hypotension\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypotension occurred in 22 (16%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to no patients in the RA group.\\nPrior to each Unituxin infusion, administer required intravenous hydration.  Closely monitor blood pressure during Unituxin treatment.  Immediately interrupt or discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management in patients with symptomatic hypotension, systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than lower limit of normal for age, or SBP that is decreased by more than 15% compared to baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Infection\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) bacteremia requiring intravenous antibiotics or other urgent intervention occurred in 17 (13%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to 5 (5%) patients treated with RA alone.  Sepsis occurred in 24 (18%) patients in the Unituxin/RA group and in 10 (9%) patients in the RA group.\\nMonitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of systemic infection and temporarily discontinue Unituxin in patients who develop systemic infection until resolution of the infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6 Bone Marrow Suppression\\n\\nIn Study 1, severe (Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia (39% vs. 25%), anemia (34% vs. 16%), neutropenia (34% vs. 13%), and febrile neutropenia (4% vs. 0 patients) occurred more commonly in patients in the Unituxin/RA group compared to patients treated with RA alone.  Monitor peripheral blood counts closely during therapy with Unituxin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.7 Electrolyte Abnormalities\\n\\nIn Study 1, electrolyte abnormalities occurring in at least 25% of patients who received Unituxin/RA included hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia.  Severe (Grade 3 or 4) hypokalemia and hyponatremia occurred in 37% and 23% of patients in the Unituxin/RA group, respectively, compared to 2% and 4% of patients in the RA group.  In a study of a related anti-GD2 antibody conducted in 12 adult patients with metastatic melanoma, 2 (13%) patients developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion resulting in severe hyponatremia.  Monitor serum electrolytes daily during therapy with Unituxin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.8 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome\\n\\nHemolytic uremic syndrome in the absence of documented infection and resulting in renal insufficiency, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension occurred in 2 patients enrolled in Study 2 following receipt of the first cycle of Unituxin.  Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome recurred following rechallenge with Unituxin in 1 patient.  Permanently discontinue Unituxin and institute supportive management for signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\\n\\nBased on its mechanism of action, Unituxin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. \\n\\n\\nImportant Differences among Lamivudine-Containing Products\\n\\xa0\\nLamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, EPIVIR oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. \\n\\n\\nEmergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV\\n\\n\\nSafety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV).

Because nizatidine is excreted primarily by the kidney, dosage should be reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (see\\xa0\\nDosage and Administration\\n).\\n3. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have not been done. Part of the dose of nizatidine is metabolized in the liver. In patients with normal renal function and uncomplicated hepatic dysfunction, the disposition of nizatidine is similar to that in normal subjects.\\n\\nLaboratory Tests—False-positive tests for urobilinogen with Multistix® may occur during therapy with nizatidine.\\n\\nDrug Interactions—No interactions have been observed between nizatidine and theophylline, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, lidocaine, phenytoin, and warfarin. Nizatidine does not inhibit the cytochrome P-450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system; therefore, drug interactions mediated by inhibition of hepatic metabolism are not expected to occur. In patients given very high doses (3,900 mg) of aspirin daily, increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when nizatidine, 150 mg b.i.d., was administered concurrently.\\n\\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility—A 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats with doses as high as 500 mg/kg/day (about 13 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect. There was a dose-related increase in the density of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric oxyntic mucosa. In a 2-year study in mice, there was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect in male mice; although hyperplastic nodules of the liver were increased in the high-dose males as compared with placebo. Female mice given the high dose of nizatidine (2,000 mg/kg/day, about 27 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) showed marginally statistically significant increases in hepatic carcinoma and hepatic nodular hyperplasia with no numerical increase seen in any of the other dose groups. The rate of hepatic carcinoma in the high-dose animals was within the historical control limits seen for the strain of mice used. The female mice were given a dose larger than the maximum tolerated dose, as indicated by excessive (30%) weight decrement as compared with concurrent controls and evidence of mild liver injury (transaminase elevations). The occurrence of a marginal finding at high dose only in animals given an excessive and somewhat hepatotoxic dose, with no evidence of a carcinogenic effect in rats, male mice, and female mice (given up to 360 mg/kg/day, about 5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), and a negative mutagenicity battery are not considered evidence of a carcinogenic potential for nizatidine.\\nNizatidine was not mutagenic in a battery of tests performed to evaluate its potential genetic toxicity, including bacterial mutation tests, unscheduled DNA synthesis, sister chromatid exchange, mouse lymphoma assay, chromosome aberration tests, and a micronucleus test.\\nIn a 2-generation, perinatal and postnatal fertility study in rats, doses of nizatidine up to 650 mg/kg/day (about 17.5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) produced no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of parental animals or their progeny.\\n\\nPregnancy—Teratogenic Effects—Pregnancy Category B—Oral reproduction studies in pregnant rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (about 40.5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 275 mg/kg/day (about 14.6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to nizatidine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\\n\\nNursing Mothers—Studies conducted in lactating women have shown that 0.1% of the administered oral dose of nizatidine is secreted in human milk in proportion to plasma concentrations. Because of the growth depression in pups reared by lactating rats treated with nizatidine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\\n\\nPediatric Use—Effectiveness in pediatric patients <12 years of age has not been established.\\nUse of nizatidine in pediatric patients from 12 to 18 years of age is supported by evidence from published pediatric literature, adequate and well-controlled published studies in adults, and by the following adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients: (see \\nDosage and Administration\\n)\\n\\nClinical Trials (Pediatric\\n).

Patients were required to have either symptomatic, clinically suspected or endoscopically diagnosed GERD with age-relevant symptoms. In patients 2 to 18 years of age, nizatidine was found generally safe and well-tolerated. In these studies in patients 12 years and older, nizatidine was found to reduce the severity and frequency of GERD symptoms, improve physical well-being, and reduce the frequency of supplemental antacid consumption. No efficacy in pediatric patients <12 years of age has been established. Clinical studies in patients 2 to 12 years of age with GERD, demonstrated no difference in either symptom improvements or healing rates between nizatidine and placebo or between different doses of nizatidine.\\n\\nGeriatric Use—Of the 955 patients in clinical studies who were treated with nizatidine, 337 (35.3%) were 65 and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\\nThis drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

       " \"null WARNING\\n\\n\\nIncreased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\\n\\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug- treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.\\nProchlorperazine maleate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see\\n \\n  \\nWARNINGS\\n). WARNINGS\\n\\n\\nIncreased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\\n\\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Prochlorperazine maleate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia- related psychosis (see\\n \\n  \\nBOXED WARNING\\n).\\n\\n \\n\\nThe extrapyramidal symptoms which can occur secondary to prochlorperazine may be confused with the central nervous system signs of an undiagnosed primary disease responsible for the vomiting, e.g., Reye's syndrome or other encephalopathy. The use of prochlorperazine and other potential hepatotoxins should be avoided in children and adolescents whose signs and symptoms suggest Reye's syndrome.\\n\\n\\nTardive Dyskinesia:Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic drug treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.\\n\\n \\nBoth the risk of developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\\nThere is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic drug treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic drug treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process.\\nThe effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.\\nGiven these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia especially in the elderly. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\\nIf signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.\\nFor further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to the sections on\\n \\n  \\nPRECAUTIONS\\xa0\\n \\n  and\\n \\n  \\nADVERSE REACTIONS.\\n \\n  \\n\\n\\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):A potentially fatal syndrome complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\\n\\n \\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous systems (CNS) pathology.\\nThe management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.\\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\\nAn encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN and FBS) has occurred in a few patients treated with lithium plus an antipsychotic. In some instances, the syndrome was followed by irreversible brain damage. Because of a possible causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurologic toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\\nPatients with bone marrow depression or who have previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., blood dyscrasias, jaundice) with a phenothiazine should not receive any phenothiazine, including prochlorperazine, unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the possible hazards.\\nProchlorperazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, caution patients about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery).\\nPhenothiazines may intensify or prolong the action of central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, anesthetics, narcotics).\\n\\nFalls:Prochlorperazine maleate tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.\\n\\n \\n\\nUsage\\nin Pregnancy:Safety for the use of prochlorperazine during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, prochlorperazine is not recommended for use in pregnant patients except in cases of severe nausea and vomiting that are so serious and intractable that, in the judgment of the physician, drug intervention is required and potential benefits outweigh possible hazards.\\n\\n \\nThere have been reported instances of prolonged jaundice, extrapyramidal signs, hyperreflexia or hyporeflexia in newborn infants whose mothers received phenothiazines.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNon-teratogenic Effects\\n\\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.\\nProchlorperazine maleate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\\n\\nNursing Mothers:There is evidence that phenothiazines are excreted in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing woman. PRECAUTIONS\\n\\n\\nLeukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis:\\n\\nIn clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.\\nPossible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue prochlorperazine maleate tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.\\nPatients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm\\n \\n  3) should discontinue prochlorperazine maleate tablets and have their WBC followed until recovery.\\n\\n \\nThe antiemetic action of prochlorperazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome (see\\n \\n  \\nWARNINGS\\n).\\n\\n \\nWhen prochlorperazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine.\\nBecause hypotension may occur, large doses and parenteral administration should be used cautiously in patients with impaired cardiovascular systems. To minimize the occurrence of hypotension after injection, keep patient lying down and observe for at least 1/2 hour. If hypotension occurs after parenteral or oral dosing, place patient in head-low position with legs raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required,\\n \\n  Levophed\\n®* and\\n \\n  Neo-Synephrine\\n®** are suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, should not be used because they may cause a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure.\\n\\n \\nAspiration of vomitus has occurred in a few post-surgical patients who have received prochlorperazine as an antiemetic. Although no causal relationship has been established, this possibility should be borne in mind during surgical aftercare.\\nDeep sleep, from which patients can be aroused, and coma have been reported, usually with overdosage.\\nAntipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately 1/3 of human breast cancers are prolactin- dependent\\n \\n  in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescribing of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.\\n\\n \\nChromosomal aberrations in spermatocytes and abnormal sperm have been demonstrated in rodents treated with certain antipsychotics.\\nAs with all drugs which exert an anticholinergic effect, and/or cause mydriasis, prochlorperazine should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma.\\nBecause phenothiazines may interfere with thermoregulatory mechanisms, use with caution in persons who will be exposed to extreme heat.\\nPhenothiazines can diminish the effect of oral anticoagulants.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPhenothiazines can produce alpha-adrenergic blockade.\\nThiazide diuretics may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that may occur with phenothiazines. Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly.\\nConcomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.\\nPhenothiazines may lower the convulsive threshold; dosage adjustments of anticonvulsants may be necessary. Potentiation of anticonvulsant effects does not occur. However, it has been reported that phenothiazines may interfere with the metabolism of\\n \\n  Dilantin\\n®*** and thus precipitate Dilantin toxicity.\\n\\n \\nThe presence of phenothiazines may produce false-positive phenylketonuria (PKU) test results.\\n\\nLong-Term Therapy:Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.\\n\\n \\nTo lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with prochlorperazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.\\n\\nChildren with acute illnesses (e.g., chickenpox, CNS infections, measles, gastroenteritis) or dehydration seem to be much more susceptible to neuromuscular reactions, particularly dystonias, than are adults. In such patients, the drug should be used only under close supervision.\\n\\nDrugs which lower the seizure threshold, including phenothiazine derivatives should not be used with\\n \\n  Amipaque\\n®§. As with other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography, should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure, and should not be used for the control of nausea and vomiting occurring either prior to myelography with Amipaque, or post-procedure.\\n\\n \\n\\nGeriatric Use:Clinical studies of prochlorperazine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. Geriatric patients are more sensitive to the side effects of antipsychotics, including prochlorperazine. These adverse events include hypotension, anticholinergic effects (such as urinary retention, constipation, and confusion), and neuromuscular reactions (such as parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia) (\\n \\n  see\\xa0\\n \\n  \\nPRECAUTIONSand\\n \\n  \\xa0\\n \\n  \\nADVERSE REACTIONS\\n). Also, postmarketing safety experience suggests that the incidence of agranulocytosis may be higher in geriatric patients compared to younger individuals who received prochlorperazine. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (\\n \\n  see\\xa0\\n \\n  \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n).\",\n",

Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous systems (CNS) pathology.\\nThe management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.\\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\\nAn encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN and FBS) has occurred in a few patients treated with lithium plus an antipsychotic. In some instances, the syndrome was followed by irreversible brain damage. Because of a possible causal relationship between these events and the concomitant administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely for early evidence of neurologic toxicity and treatment discontinued promptly if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\\nPatients with bone marrow depression or who have previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., blood dyscrasias, jaundice) with a phenothiazine should not receive any phenothiazine, including prochlorperazine, unless in the judgment of the physician the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the possible hazards.\\nProchlorperazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, caution patients about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery).\\nPhenothiazines may intensify or prolong the action of central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, anesthetics, narcotics).\\n\\nFalls:Prochlorperazine maleate tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.\\n\\n \\n\\nUsage\\nin Pregnancy:Safety for the use of prochlorperazine during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, prochlorperazine is not recommended for use in pregnant patients except in cases of severe nausea and vomiting that are so serious and intractable that, in the judgment of the physician, drug intervention is required and potential benefits outweigh possible hazards.\\n\\n \\nThere have been reported instances of prolonged jaundice, extrapyramidal signs, hyperreflexia or hyporeflexia in newborn infants whose mothers received phenothiazines.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNon-teratogenic Effects\\n\\nNeonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.\\nProchlorperazine maleate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\\n\\nNursing Mothers:There is evidence that phenothiazines are excreted in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing woman. PRECAUTIONS\\n\\n\\nLeukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis:\\n\\nIn clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.\\nPossible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue prochlorperazine maleate tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.\\nPatients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm\\n \\n  3) should discontinue prochlorperazine maleate tablets and have their WBC followed until recovery.\\n\\n \\nThe antiemetic action of prochlorperazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome (see\\n \\n  \\nWARNINGS\\n).\\n\\n \\nWhen prochlorperazine is used with cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, vomiting as a sign of the toxicity of these agents may be obscured by the antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine.\\nBecause hypotension may occur, large doses and parenteral administration should be used cautiously in patients with impaired cardiovascular systems. To minimize the occurrence of hypotension after injection, keep patient lying down and observe for at least 1/2 hour. If hypotension occurs after parenteral or oral dosing, place patient in head-low position with legs raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required,\\n \\n  Levophed\\n®* and\\n \\n  Neo-Synephrine\\n®** are suitable. Other pressor agents, including epinephrine, should not be used because they may cause a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure.\\n\\n \\nAspiration of vomitus has occurred in a few post-surgical patients who have received prochlorperazine as an antiemetic. Although no causal relationship has been established, this possibility should be borne in mind during surgical aftercare.\\nDeep sleep, from which patients can be aroused, and coma have been reported, usually with overdosage.\\nAntipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately 1/3 of human breast cancers are prolactin- dependent\\n \\n  in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescribing of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.\\n\\n \\nChromosomal aberrations in spermatocytes and abnormal sperm have been demonstrated in rodents treated with certain antipsychotics.\\nAs with all drugs which exert an anticholinergic effect, and/or cause mydriasis, prochlorperazine should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma.\\nBecause phenothiazines may interfere with thermoregulatory mechanisms, use with caution in persons who will be exposed to extreme heat.\\nPhenothiazines can diminish the effect of oral anticoagulants.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPhenothiazines can produce alpha-adrenergic blockade.\\nThiazide diuretics may accentuate the orthostatic hypotension that may occur with phenothiazines. Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concomitantly.\\nConcomitant administration of propranolol with phenothiazines results in increased plasma levels of both drugs.\\nPhenothiazines may lower the convulsive threshold; dosage adjustments of anticonvulsants may be necessary. Potentiation of anticonvulsant effects does not occur. However, it has been reported that phenothiazines may interfere with the metabolism of\\n \\n  Dilantin\\n®*** and thus precipitate Dilantin toxicity.\\n\\n \\nThe presence of phenothiazines may produce false-positive phenylketonuria (PKU) test results.\\n\\nLong-Term Therapy:Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.\\n\\n \\nTo lessen the likelihood of adverse reactions related to cumulative drug effect, patients with a history of long-term therapy with prochlorperazine and/or other antipsychotics should be evaluated periodically to decide whether the maintenance dosage could be lowered or drug therapy discontinued.\\n\\nChildren with acute illnesses (e.g., chickenpox, CNS infections, measles, gastroenteritis) or dehydration seem to be much more susceptible to neuromuscular reactions, particularly dystonias, than are adults. In such patients, the drug should be used only under close supervision.\\n\\nDrugs which lower the seizure threshold, including phenothiazine derivatives should not be used with\\n \\n  Amipaque\\n®§. As with other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine should be discontinued at least 48 hours before myelography, should not be resumed for at least 24 hours postprocedure, and should not be used for the control of nausea and vomiting occurring either prior to myelography with Amipaque, or post-procedure.\\n\\n \\n\\nGeriatric Use:Clinical studies of prochlorperazine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. Geriatric patients are more sensitive to the side effects of antipsychotics, including prochlorperazine. These adverse events include hypotension, anticholinergic effects (such as urinary retention, constipation, and confusion), and neuromuscular reactions (such as parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia) (\\n \\n  see\\xa0\\n \\n  \\nPRECAUTIONSand\\n \\n  \\xa0\\n \\n  \\nADVERSE REACTIONS\\n). Also, postmarketing safety experience suggests that the incidence of agranulocytosis may be higher in geriatric patients compared to younger individuals who received prochlorperazine. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (\\n \\n  see\\xa0\\n \\n  \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n).\",\n",

Concomitant negative chronotropic therapy such as digoxin or beta-blockers may lower the risk of this complication.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPROARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS \\n\\n\\nFlecainide acetate, like other antiarrhythmic agents, can cause new or worsened supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, e.g., tachycardia that is more sustained or more resistant to conversion to sinus rhythm, with potentially fatal consequences. In studies of ventricular arrhythmia patients treated with flecainide acetate, three-fourths of proarrhythmic events were new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the remainder being increased frequency of PVCs or new supraventricular arrhythmias. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. In studies of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmia (108 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 117 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), there were 9 (4%) proarrhythmic events, 8 of them in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Of the 9, 7 (including the one in a PSVT patient) were exacerbations of supraventricular arrhythmias (longer duration, more rapid rate, harder to reverse) while 2 were ventricular arrhythmias, including one fatal case of VT/VF and one wide complex VT (the patient showed inducible VT, however, after withdrawal of flecainide), both in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known coronary artery disease.\\n\\n\\nIt is uncertain if flecainide acetate's risk of proarrhythmia is exaggerated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), high ventricular rate, and/or exercise. Wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in two of 12 CAF patients undergoing maximal exercise tolerance testing.\\n\\n\\nIn patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, it is often difficult to distinguish a spontaneous variation in the patient's underlying rhythm disorder from drug-induced worsening, so that the following occurrence rates must be considered approximations. Their frequency appears to be related to dose and to the underlying cardiac disease.\\n\\n\\nAmong patients treated for sustained VT (who frequently also had CHF, a low ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction and/or an episode of cardiac arrest), the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 13% when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In early studies in patients with sustained VT utilizing a higher initial dose (400 mg/day) the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 26%; moreover, in about 10% of the patients treated proarrhythmic events resulted in death, despite prompt medical attention. With lower initial doses, the incidence of proarrhythmic events resulting in death decreased to 0.5% of these patients. Accordingly, it is extremely important to follow the recommended dosage schedule. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\\n\\n\\nThe relatively high frequency of proarrhythmic events in patients with sustained VT and serious underlying heart disease, and the need for careful titration and monitoring, requires that therapy of patients with sustained VT be started in the hospital. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\\n\\n\\nHEART FAILURE\\n\\n\\nFlecainide acetate has a negative inotropic effect and may cause or worsen CHF, particularly in patients with cardiomyopathy, preexisting severe heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV) or low ejection fractions (less than 30%). In patients with supraventricular arrhythmias new or worsened CHF developed in 0.4% (1/225) of patients. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia during a mean duration of 7.9 months of flecainide acetate therapy, 6.3% (20/317) developed new CHF. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and a history of CHF, during a mean duration of 5.4 months of flecainide acetate therapy, 25.7% (78/304) developed worsened CHF. Exacerbation of preexisting CHF occurred more commonly in studies which included patients with class III or IV failure than in studies which excluded such patients. Flecainide acetate should be used cautiously in patients who are known to have a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction. The initial dosage in such patients should be no more than 100 mg bid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and patients should be monitored carefully. Close attention must be given to maintenance of cardiac function, including optimization of digitalis, diuretic, or other therapy. In cases where CHF has developed or worsened during treatment with flecainide acetate, the time of onset has ranged from a few hours to several months after starting therapy. Some patients who develop evidence of reduced myocardial function while on flecainide acetate can continue on flecainide acetate with adjustment of digitalis or diuretics, others may require dosage reduction or discontinuation of flecainide acetate. When feasible, it is recommended that plasma flecainide levels be monitored. Attempts should be made to keep trough plasma levels below 0.7 to 1.0 mcg/mL.\\n\\n\\nEffects on Cardiac Conduction\\n\\nFlecainide acetate slows cardiac conduction in most patients to produce dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals. PR interval increases on average about 25% (0.04 seconds) and as much as 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop new first-degree AV heart block (PR interval ≥ 0.2 seconds). The QRS complex increases on average about 25% (0.02 seconds) and as much as 150% in some patients. Many patients develop QRS complexes with a duration of 0.12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed new bundle branch block while on flecainide acetate. The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict either efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it was unusual for PR intervals to increase to 0.3 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to increase to 0.18 seconds or more. Thus, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens about 8%, but most of this widening (about 60% to 90%) is due to widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) only widens about 4% on the average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. There have been rare cases of Torsade de Pointes-type arrhythmia associated with flecainide acetate therapy.\\nClinically significant conduction changes have been observed at these rates: sinus node dysfunction such as sinus pause, sinus arrest and symptomatic bradycardia (1.2%), second-degree AV block (0.5%) and third-degree AV block (0.4%). An attempt should be made to manage the patient on the lowest effective dose in an effort to minimize these effects. (See \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n). If second- or third-degree AV block, or right bundle branch block associated with a left hemiblock occur, flecainide acetate therapy should be discontinued unless a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker is in place to ensure an adequate ventricular rate.\\n\\nSick Sinus Syndrome (Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome)\\n\\nFlecainide acetate should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest. \\n\\nEffects on Pacemaker Thresholds\\n\\nFlecainide acetate is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.\\nThe pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with flecainide acetate, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally, threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.\\n\\nElectrolyte Disturbances\\n\\nHypokalemia or hyperkalemia may alter the effects of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Preexisting hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be corrected before administration of flecainide acetate.\\n\\nPediatric Use\\n\\nThe safety and efficacy of flecainide acetate in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of flecainide acetate, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, flecainide acetate has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide acetate should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of flecainide acetate in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children. PRECAUTIONS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrug Interactions \\n\\nFlecainide acetate has been administered to patients receiving digitalis preparations or beta-adrenergic\\nblocking agents without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of flecainide acetate to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of digoxin, a 13% to 19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.\\nIn a study involving healthy subjects receiving flecainide acetate and propranolol concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, flecainide acetate and propranolol were each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of flecainide acetate and propranolol on the PR interval were less than additive. In flecainide acetate clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of beta blockers and flecainide should be recognized.\\nFlecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. In vitro studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g., anticoagulants) would not be expected. Flecainide acetate has been used in a large number of patients receiving diuretics without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving cimetidine (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.\\nWhen amiodarone is added to flecainide therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced. (See\\n DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n).\\nDrugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as quinidine, might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.\\nThere has been little experience with the coadministration of flecainide acetate and either disopyramide or verapamil. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with flecainide acetate are unknown, neither disopyramide nor verapamil should be administered concurrently with flecainide unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide acetate with nifedipine or diltiazem to recommend concomitant use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \\n\\nLong-term studies with flecainide in rats and mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day have not revealed any compound-related carcinogenic effects. Mutagenicity studies (Ames test, mouse lymphoma and in vivo cytogenetics) did not reveal any mutagenic effects. A rat reproduction study at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (seven times the usual human dose) did not reveal any adverse effect on male or female fertility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPregnancy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPregnancy Category C\\n\\n\\nFlecainide has been shown to have teratogenic effects (club paws, sternebrae and vertebrae abnormalities, pale hearts with contracted ventricular septum) and an embryotoxic effect (increased resorptions) in one breed of rabbit (New Zealand White) when given doses of 30 and 35 mg/kg/day, but not in another breed of rabbit (Dutch Belted) when given doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and mice given doses up to 50 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively; however, delayed sternebral and vertebral ossification was observed at the high dose in rats. Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, flecainide acetate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabor and Delivery\\n\\nIt is not known whether the use of flecainide acetate during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the mother or fetus, affects the duration of labor or delivery, or increases the possibility of forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNursing Mothers\\n\\nResults from a multiple dose study conducted in mothers soon after delivery indicates that flecainide is excreted in human breast milk in concentrations as high as 4 times (with average levels about 2.5 times) corresponding plasma levels; assuming a maternal plasma level at the top of the therapeutic range (1 mcg/mL), the calculated daily dose to a nursing infant (assuming about 700 mL breast milk over 24 hours) would be less than 3 mg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPediatric Use \\n\\nThe safety and efficacy of flecainide acetate in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (see \\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, and \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHepatic Impairment \\n\\nSince flecainide elimination from plasma can be markedly slower in patients with significant hepatic impairment, flecainide acetate should not be used in such patients unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If used, frequent and early plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage (see \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Plasma Level Monitoring\\n); dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days).\",\n",

Concomitant negative chronotropic therapy such as digoxin or beta-blockers may lower the risk of this complication.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPROARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS \\n\\n\\nFlecainide acetate, like other antiarrhythmic agents, can cause new or worsened supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, e.g., tachycardia that is more sustained or more resistant to conversion to sinus rhythm, with potentially fatal consequences. In studies of ventricular arrhythmia patients treated with flecainide acetate, three-fourths of proarrhythmic events were new or worsened ventricular tachyarrhythmias, the remainder being increased frequency of PVCs or new supraventricular arrhythmias. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. In studies of 225 patients with supraventricular arrhythmia (108 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 117 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation), there were 9 (4%) proarrhythmic events, 8 of them in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Of the 9, 7 (including the one in a PSVT patient) were exacerbations of supraventricular arrhythmias (longer duration, more rapid rate, harder to reverse) while 2 were ventricular arrhythmias, including one fatal case of VT/VF and one wide complex VT (the patient showed inducible VT, however, after withdrawal of flecainide), both in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known coronary artery disease.\\n\\n\\nIt is uncertain if flecainide acetate's risk of proarrhythmia is exaggerated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), high ventricular rate, and/or exercise. Wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in two of 12 CAF patients undergoing maximal exercise tolerance testing.\\n\\n\\nIn patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, it is often difficult to distinguish a spontaneous variation in the patient's underlying rhythm disorder from drug-induced worsening, so that the following occurrence rates must be considered approximations. Their frequency appears to be related to dose and to the underlying cardiac disease.\\n\\n\\nAmong patients treated for sustained VT (who frequently also had CHF, a low ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction and/or an episode of cardiac arrest), the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 13% when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In early studies in patients with sustained VT utilizing a higher initial dose (400 mg/day) the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 26%; moreover, in about 10% of the patients treated proarrhythmic events resulted in death, despite prompt medical attention. With lower initial doses, the incidence of proarrhythmic events resulting in death decreased to 0.5% of these patients. Accordingly, it is extremely important to follow the recommended dosage schedule. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\\n\\n\\nThe relatively high frequency of proarrhythmic events in patients with sustained VT and serious underlying heart disease, and the need for careful titration and monitoring, requires that therapy of patients with sustained VT be started in the hospital. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\\n\\n\\nHEART FAILURE\\n\\n\\nFlecainide acetate has a negative inotropic effect and may cause or worsen CHF, particularly in patients with cardiomyopathy, preexisting severe heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV) or low ejection fractions (less than 30%). In patients with supraventricular arrhythmias new or worsened CHF developed in 0.4% (1/225) of patients. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia during a mean duration of 7.9 months of flecainide acetate therapy, 6.3% (20/317) developed new CHF. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and a history of CHF, during a mean duration of 5.4 months of flecainide acetate therapy, 25.7% (78/304) developed worsened CHF. Exacerbation of preexisting CHF occurred more commonly in studies which included patients with class III or IV failure than in studies which excluded such patients. Flecainide acetate should be used cautiously in patients who are known to have a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction. The initial dosage in such patients should be no more than 100 mg bid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and patients should be monitored carefully. Close attention must be given to maintenance of cardiac function, including optimization of digitalis, diuretic, or other therapy. In cases where CHF has developed or worsened during treatment with flecainide acetate, the time of onset has ranged from a few hours to several months after starting therapy. Some patients who develop evidence of reduced myocardial function while on flecainide acetate can continue on flecainide acetate with adjustment of digitalis or diuretics, others may require dosage reduction or discontinuation of flecainide acetate. When feasible, it is recommended that plasma flecainide levels be monitored. Attempts should be made to keep trough plasma levels below 0.7 to 1.0 mcg/mL.\\n\\n\\nEffects on Cardiac Conduction\\n\\nFlecainide acetate slows cardiac conduction in most patients to produce dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals. PR interval increases on average about 25% (0.04 seconds) and as much as 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop new first-degree AV heart block (PR interval ≥ 0.2 seconds). The QRS complex increases on average about 25% (0.02 seconds) and as much as 150% in some patients. Many patients develop QRS complexes with a duration of 0.12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed new bundle branch block while on flecainide acetate. The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict either efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it was unusual for PR intervals to increase to 0.3 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to increase to 0.18 seconds or more. Thus, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens about 8%, but most of this widening (about 60% to 90%) is due to widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) only widens about 4% on the average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. There have been rare cases of Torsade de Pointes-type arrhythmia associated with flecainide acetate therapy.\\nClinically significant conduction changes have been observed at these rates: sinus node dysfunction such as sinus pause, sinus arrest and symptomatic bradycardia (1.2%), second-degree AV block (0.5%) and third-degree AV block (0.4%). An attempt should be made to manage the patient on the lowest effective dose in an effort to minimize these effects. (See \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n). If second- or third-degree AV block, or right bundle branch block associated with a left hemiblock occur, flecainide acetate therapy should be discontinued unless a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker is in place to ensure an adequate ventricular rate.\\n\\nSick Sinus Syndrome (Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome)\\n\\nFlecainide acetate should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest. \\n\\nEffects on Pacemaker Thresholds\\n\\nFlecainide acetate is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.\\nThe pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with flecainide acetate, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally, threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.\\n\\nElectrolyte Disturbances\\n\\nHypokalemia or hyperkalemia may alter the effects of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Preexisting hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be corrected before administration of flecainide acetate.\\n\\nPediatric Use\\n\\nThe safety and efficacy of flecainide acetate in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of flecainide acetate, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, flecainide acetate has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide acetate should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of flecainide acetate in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children. PRECAUTIONS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrug Interactions \\n\\nFlecainide acetate has been administered to patients receiving digitalis preparations or beta-adrenergic\\nblocking agents without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of flecainide acetate to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of digoxin, a 13% to 19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.\\nIn a study involving healthy subjects receiving flecainide acetate and propranolol concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, flecainide acetate and propranolol were each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of flecainide acetate and propranolol on the PR interval were less than additive. In flecainide acetate clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of beta blockers and flecainide should be recognized.\\nFlecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. In vitro studies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g., anticoagulants) would not be expected. Flecainide acetate has been used in a large number of patients receiving diuretics without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving cimetidine (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.\\nWhen amiodarone is added to flecainide therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced. (See\\n DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n).\\nDrugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as quinidine, might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.\\nThere has been little experience with the coadministration of flecainide acetate and either disopyramide or verapamil. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with flecainide acetate are unknown, neither disopyramide nor verapamil should be administered concurrently with flecainide unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide acetate with nifedipine or diltiazem to recommend concomitant use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \\n\\nLong-term studies with flecainide in rats and mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day have not revealed any compound-related carcinogenic effects. Mutagenicity studies (Ames test, mouse lymphoma and in vivo cytogenetics) did not reveal any mutagenic effects. A rat reproduction study at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (seven times the usual human dose) did not reveal any adverse effect on male or female fertility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPregnancy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPregnancy Category C\\n\\n\\nFlecainide has been shown to have teratogenic effects (club paws, sternebrae and vertebrae abnormalities, pale hearts with contracted ventricular septum) and an embryotoxic effect (increased resorptions) in one breed of rabbit (New Zealand White) when given doses of 30 and 35 mg/kg/day, but not in another breed of rabbit (Dutch Belted) when given doses up to 30 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats and mice given doses up to 50 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively; however, delayed sternebral and vertebral ossification was observed at the high dose in rats. Because there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, flecainide acetate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabor and Delivery\\n\\nIt is not known whether the use of flecainide acetate during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the mother or fetus, affects the duration of labor or delivery, or increases the possibility of forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNursing Mothers\\n\\nResults from a multiple dose study conducted in mothers soon after delivery indicates that flecainide is excreted in human breast milk in concentrations as high as 4 times (with average levels about 2.5 times) corresponding plasma levels; assuming a maternal plasma level at the top of the therapeutic range (1 mcg/mL), the calculated daily dose to a nursing infant (assuming about 700 mL breast milk over 24 hours) would be less than 3 mg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPediatric Use \\n\\nThe safety and efficacy of flecainide acetate in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (see \\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, and \\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\\n).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHepatic Impairment \\n\\nSince flecainide elimination from plasma can be markedly slower in patients with significant hepatic impairment, flecainide acetate should not be used in such patients unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

Monitor patient periodically for such signs and      apprise the patient of the symptoms for which they need to seek medical      help. (5.4)\\nOcular Toxicity: Has occurred when      administered via unapproved intraarterial intracarotid route. (5.5)\\nEmbryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause      fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk      to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (5.6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 Myelosuppression\\n\\nBone marrow toxicity is a dose-limiting, common and severe toxic effect of carmustine for injection, USP occurring 4-6 weeks after drug administration (thrombocytopenia occurs at about 4 weeks post-administration persisting for 1 to 2 weeks; leukopenia occurs at 5 to 6 weeks after a dose of carmustine for injection, USP persisting for 1 to 2 weeks; thrombocytopenia is generally more severe than leukopenia; anemia is less frequent and less severe compared to thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia) Complete blood count should therefore be monitored weekly for at least six weeks after a dose. Repeat doses of carmustine for injection, USP should not be given more frequently than every six weeks. The bone marrow toxicity of carmustine for injection, USP is cumulative and therefore the dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Greater myelotoxicity (e.g., leukopenia and neutropenia) has been reported when carmustine was combined with cimetidine [see Drug Interactions (7)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity\\n\\nCases of fatal pulmonary toxicity with carmustine for injection, USP have been reported. Pulmonary toxicity characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported to occur from 9 days to 43 months after treatment with carmustine for injection, USP and related nitrosoureas. Pulmonary toxicity from carmustine for injection, USP is dose-related. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m2 cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less. However, there have been reports of pulmonary fibrosis in patients receiving lower total doses. Interstitial fibrosis (with lower doses) occurred rarely. Additionally, delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis occurring up to 17 years after treatment has been reported in patients who received carmustine for injection, USP (in cumulative doses ranging from 770 to 1800 mg/m2 combined with cranial radiotherapy for intracranial tumors) in childhood and early adolescence. Other risk factors include past history of lung disease and duration of treatment. Baseline pulmonary function studies should be conducted along with frequent pulmonary function tests during treatment. Patients with a baseline below 70% of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) are particularly at risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Administration Reactions\\n\\nInjection site reactions may occur during the administration of carmustine for injection, USP. Rapid intravenous infusion of carmustine for injection, USP may produce intensive flushing of the skin and suffusion of the conjunctiva within 2 hours, lasting about 4 hours. It is also associated with burning at the site of injection although true thrombosis is rare. Given the possibility of extravasation, close monitoring of the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration is recommended. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Carcinogenicity\\n\\nLong-term use of nitrosoureas, such as carmustine for injection, USP, has been reported to be associated with the development of secondary malignancies. Carmustine was carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1)]. Nitrosourea therapy, such as carmustine for injection, USP, has carcinogenic potential in humans. Patients treated with carmustine for injection, USP should be monitored long-term for development of second malignancies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Ocular Toxicity\\n\\nCarmustine for injection, USP has been administered through an intraarterial intracarotid route; this procedure is investigational and has been associated with ocular toxicity. Safety and effectiveness of the intraarterial route have not been established. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\\n\\nCarmustine was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits and teratogenic in rats when given in doses lower than the maximum cumulative human dose based on body surface area. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with carmustine for injection, USP for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with carmustine for injection, USP for at least 3 months after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. WARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION and PULMONARY TOXICITY\\n\\n\\nMyelosuppression \\n\\n\\nCarmustine for injection, USP causes suppression of marrow function (including thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections.

(5.4)\\nOcular Toxicity: Has occurred when      administered via unapproved intraarterial intracarotid route. (5.5)\\nEmbryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause      fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk      to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (5.6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 Myelosuppression\\n\\nBone marrow toxicity is a dose-limiting, common and severe toxic effect of carmustine for injection, USP occurring 4-6 weeks after drug administration (thrombocytopenia occurs at about 4 weeks post-administration persisting for 1 to 2 weeks; leukopenia occurs at 5 to 6 weeks after a dose of carmustine for injection, USP persisting for 1 to 2 weeks; thrombocytopenia is generally more severe than leukopenia; anemia is less frequent and less severe compared to thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia) Complete blood count should therefore be monitored weekly for at least six weeks after a dose. Repeat doses of carmustine for injection, USP should not be given more frequently than every six weeks. The bone marrow toxicity of carmustine for injection, USP is cumulative and therefore the dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Greater myelotoxicity (e.g., leukopenia and neutropenia) has been reported when carmustine was combined with cimetidine [see Drug Interactions (7)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity\\n\\nCases of fatal pulmonary toxicity with carmustine for injection, USP have been reported. Pulmonary toxicity characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported to occur from 9 days to 43 months after treatment with carmustine for injection, USP and related nitrosoureas. Pulmonary toxicity from carmustine for injection, USP is dose-related. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m2 cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less. However, there have been reports of pulmonary fibrosis in patients receiving lower total doses. Interstitial fibrosis (with lower doses) occurred rarely. Additionally, delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis occurring up to 17 years after treatment has been reported in patients who received carmustine for injection, USP (in cumulative doses ranging from 770 to 1800 mg/m2 combined with cranial radiotherapy for intracranial tumors) in childhood and early adolescence. Other risk factors include past history of lung disease and duration of treatment. Baseline pulmonary function studies should be conducted along with frequent pulmonary function tests during treatment. Patients with a baseline below 70% of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) are particularly at risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Administration Reactions\\n\\nInjection site reactions may occur during the administration of carmustine for injection, USP. Rapid intravenous infusion of carmustine for injection, USP may produce intensive flushing of the skin and suffusion of the conjunctiva within 2 hours, lasting about 4 hours. It is also associated with burning at the site of injection although true thrombosis is rare. Given the possibility of extravasation, close monitoring of the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration is recommended. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Carcinogenicity\\n\\nLong-term use of nitrosoureas, such as carmustine for injection, USP, has been reported to be associated with the development of secondary malignancies. Carmustine was carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1)]. Nitrosourea therapy, such as carmustine for injection, USP, has carcinogenic potential in humans. Patients treated with carmustine for injection, USP should be monitored long-term for development of second malignancies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Ocular Toxicity\\n\\nCarmustine for injection, USP has been administered through an intraarterial intracarotid route; this procedure is investigational and has been associated with ocular toxicity. Safety and effectiveness of the intraarterial route have not been established. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\\n\\nCarmustine was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits and teratogenic in rats when given in doses lower than the maximum cumulative human dose based on body surface area. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with carmustine for injection, USP for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with carmustine for injection, USP for at least 3 months after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. WARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION and PULMONARY TOXICITY\\n\\n\\nMyelosuppression \\n\\n\\nCarmustine for injection, USP causes suppression of marrow function (including thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections. [see Warnings and Precautions\\xa0\\n(5.1) and Adverse Reactions\\xa0\\n(6)\\n]. Monitor blood counts weekly for at least 6 weeks after each dose. Adjust dosage based on nadir blood counts from the prior dose [see Dosage and Administration\\xa0\\n(2.1)\\n]. Do not administer a repeat course of carmustine for injection, USP until blood counts recover.\\n\\n\\nPulmonary Toxicity\\n\\n\\nCarmustine for injection, USP causes dose-related pulmonary toxicity. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/m2cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less. Delayed pulmonary toxicity can occur years after treatment, and can result in death, particularly in patients treated in childhood [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWARNING: MYELOSUPPRESSION and PULMONARY TOXICITY\\n\\n\\nSee full prescribing information for complete boxed warning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuppression of marrow function,      notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, is the most common and severe of      the toxic effects of carmustine for injection, USP.

Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.\\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [\\n         \\n \\n  see Warnings and Precautions(\\n          \\n  \\n   5.2)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\nStatus Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery\\n\\nTwo large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (\\n         \\n \\n  4)].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\nPost-MI Patients\\n\\nObservational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.\\nAvoid the use of meloxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If meloxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation\\n\\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.\\n\\nRisk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation\\n\\nPatients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.\\nStrategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:\\n\\nUse the      lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.\\nAvoid      administration of more than one NSAID at a time.\\nAvoid use      in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the      increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with      active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.\\nRemain      alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID      therapy.\\nIf a      serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and      treatment, and discontinue meloxicam until a serious GI adverse event is      ruled out.\\nIn the      setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis,      monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [\\n          \\n  \\n   see Drug Interactions (\\n           \\n   \\n    7)\\n          \\n  \\n    ].\\n         \\n \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Hepatotoxicity\\n\\nElevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.\\nElevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including meloxicam.\\nInform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue meloxicam immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient [\\n         \\n \\n  see Use in Specific Populations (\\n          \\n  \\n   8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology(\\n          \\n  \\n   12.3)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Hypertension\\n\\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, can lead to new onset or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\nMonitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Heart Failure and Edema\\n\\nThe Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\\' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selectivetreated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.\\nAdditionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of meloxicam may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\nAvoid the use of meloxicam in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If meloxicam is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia\\n\\n\\nRenal Toxicity \\n\\nLong-term administration of NSAIDs, including meloxicam, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury. \\nRenal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\\nThe renal effects of meloxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some meloxicam metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. \\nCorrect volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating meloxicam. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of meloxicam [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ]. \\n        \\n\\n \\nNo information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If meloxicam is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [\\n         \\n \\n  see Clinical Pharmacology (\\n          \\n  \\n   12.3)\\n         \\n \\n  ]. \\n        \\n\\n \\n\\nHyperkalemia \\n\\nIncreases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions\\n\\nMeloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [\\n         \\n \\n  see Contraindications (\\n          \\n  \\n   4) and Warnings and Precautions (\\n          \\n  \\n   5.8)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\nSeek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity\\n\\nA subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, meloxicam is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [\\n         \\n \\n  see Contraindications (\\n          \\n  \\n   4)\\n         \\n \\n  ]. When meloxicam is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.9 Serious Skin Reactions\\n\\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of meloxicam at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Meloxicam is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [\\n         \\n \\n  see Contraindications (\\n          \\n  \\n   4)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus\\n\\nMeloxicam cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Slowly taper patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.11 Hematologic Toxicity\\n\\nAnemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with meloxicam has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. \\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever\\n\\nThe pharmacological activity of meloxicam in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.13 Laboratory Monitoring\\n\\nBecause serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [\\n         \\n \\n  see Warnings and Precautions (\\n          \\n  \\n   5.2, \\n          \\n  \\n   5.3, \\n          \\n  \\n   5.6)\\n         \\n \\n  ].

Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.\\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [\\n         \\n \\n  see Warnings and Precautions(\\n          \\n  \\n   5.2)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\nStatus Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery\\n\\nTwo large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (\\n         \\n \\n  4)].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\nPost-MI Patients\\n\\nObservational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.\\nAvoid the use of meloxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If meloxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation\\n\\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.\\n\\nRisk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation\\n\\nPatients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.\\nStrategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:\\n\\nUse the      lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.\\nAvoid      administration of more than one NSAID at a time.\\nAvoid use      in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the      increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with      active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.\\nRemain      alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID      therapy.\\nIf a      serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and      treatment, and discontinue meloxicam until a serious GI adverse event is      ruled out.\\nIn the      setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis,      monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [\\n          \\n  \\n   see Drug Interactions (\\n           \\n   \\n    7)\\n          \\n  \\n    ].\\n         \\n \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3 Hepatotoxicity\\n\\nElevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.\\nElevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including meloxicam.\\nInform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue meloxicam immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient [\\n         \\n \\n  see Use in Specific Populations (\\n          \\n  \\n   8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology(\\n          \\n  \\n   12.3)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4 Hypertension\\n\\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, can lead to new onset or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\nMonitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.5 Heart Failure and Edema\\n\\nThe Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\\' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selectivetreated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.\\nAdditionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of meloxicam may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\nAvoid the use of meloxicam in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If meloxicam is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia\\n\\n\\nRenal Toxicity \\n\\nLong-term administration of NSAIDs, including meloxicam, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury. \\nRenal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\\nThe renal effects of meloxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some meloxicam metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. \\nCorrect volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating meloxicam. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of meloxicam [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ]. \\n        \\n\\n \\nNo information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If meloxicam is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [\\n         \\n \\n  see Clinical Pharmacology (\\n          \\n  \\n   12.3)\\n         \\n \\n  ]. \\n        \\n\\n \\n\\nHyperkalemia \\n\\nIncreases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions\\n\\nMeloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [\\n         \\n \\n  see Contraindications (\\n          \\n  \\n   4) and Warnings and Precautions (\\n          \\n  \\n   5.8)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\nSeek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity\\n\\nA subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, meloxicam is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [\\n         \\n \\n  see Contraindications (\\n          \\n  \\n   4)\\n         \\n \\n  ]. When meloxicam is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.9 Serious Skin Reactions\\n\\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of meloxicam at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Meloxicam is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [\\n         \\n \\n  see Contraindications (\\n          \\n  \\n   4)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus\\n\\nMeloxicam cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Slowly taper patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.11 Hematologic Toxicity\\n\\nAnemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with meloxicam has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. \\nNSAIDs, including meloxicam, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [\\n         \\n \\n  see Drug Interactions (\\n          \\n  \\n   7)\\n         \\n \\n  ].\\n        \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever\\n\\nThe pharmacological activity of meloxicam in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5.13 Laboratory Monitoring\\n\\nBecause serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [\\n         \\n \\n  see Warnings and Precautions (\\n          \\n  \\n   5.2, \\n          \\n  \\n   5.3, \\n          \\n  \\n   5.6)\\n         \\n \\n  ].
